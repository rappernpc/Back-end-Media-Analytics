"Conor Lamb, a Democrat and former Marine, scored a razor-thin but extraordinary upset in a special House election in southwestern Pennsylvania after a few thousand absentee ballots cemented a Democratic victory in the heart of President Trump’s Rust Belt base.,The Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, may still contest the outcome. But Mr. Lamb’s 627-vote lead Wednesday afternoon appeared insurmountable, given that the four counties in Pennsylvania’s 18th district have about 500 provisional, military and other absentee ballots left to count, election officials said.,That slim margin — out of almost 230,000 ballots cast in a district that Mr. Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016 — nonetheless upended the political landscape ahead of November’s midterm elections. It also emboldened Democrats to run maverick campaigns even in deep-red areas where Republicans remain bedeviled by Mr. Trump’s unpopularity.,Republican officials in Washington said they were likely to demand a recount through litigation, and the National Republican Congressional Committee put out a call for voters to report any irregularities in the balloting. Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the committee, said the party was “not conceding anything.”,The battle for a district in suburban and rural areas around Pittsburgh underscored the degree to which Mr. Trump’s appeal has receded across the country. And it exposed the ways in which both parties are weighed down by divisive leaders: Democrats by Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader; Republicans by Mr. Trump and Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House.,Just as vividly, the race showed that only one party — the Democrats — appears willing to grapple with the implications of campaigning under its unpopular figurehead.,In Pennsylvania, Mr. Lamb, a 33-year-old former prosecutor from a local Democratic dynasty, presented himself as independent-minded and neighborly, vowing early that he would not support Ms. Pelosi to lead House Democrats and playing down his connections to his national party. He echoed traditional Democratic themes about union rights and economic fairness, but took a more conservative position on the hot-button issue of guns.,Throughout the race, Mr. Lamb said he welcomed support from people who voted for Mr. Trump, and he saved his most blunt criticism for Mr. Ryan, highlighting the speaker’s ambitions to overhaul Social Security and Medicare.,Mr. Lamb’s approach could become a template for a cluster of more moderate Democrats contesting conservative-leaning seats, in states like Arkansas, Kansas and Utah. Democrats in Washington have focused chiefly on Republican-held seats in the upscale suburbs where Mr. Trump is most intensely disliked.,But they are hungry for gains across the political map, and in red areas they have encouraged candidates to put local imperatives above fealty to the national party, even tolerating outright disavowals of Ms. Pelosi.,Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, a Democrat who represents a farm and manufacturing district Mr. Trump narrowly carried, said the party’s recruits should feel free to oppose Ms. Pelosi if they choose. She noted that she was helping one such anti-Pelosi candidate, Paul Davis of Kansas, who was in Washington this week raising money.,“If they want somebody else to be a leader, then they ought to express that,” Ms. Bustos said. “I don’t have a problem with that.”,Representative Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, a veteran Democrat from a neighboring district, said Mr. Lamb had benefited from “buyer’s remorse” among Trump supporters and had wisely tailored his message to the conservative-leaning area.,“This guy has made a lot of promises that aren’t being kept,” Mr. Doyle said of the president.,On the Republican side, Mr. Saccone, 60, campaigned chiefly as a stand-in for Mr. Trump, endorsing the president’s agenda from top to bottom. He campaigned extensively with Mr. Trump and members of his administration and relied heavily on campaign spending from outside Republican groups that attempted to make Ms. Pelosi a central voting issue. Conservative outside groups also sought to promote the tax cuts recently enacted by the party, but found that message had little effect.,Yet the Republicans’ all-hands rescue mission was not enough to salvage Mr. Saccone’s candidacy. Mr. Saccone has not conceded and Republicans have indicated they may challenge the results through litigation, a long-shot strategy.,In a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday morning, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who leads the party’s campaign committee, described the race as “too close to call,” according to a person who heard his presentation.,But Mr. Ryan and Mr. Stivers also called the election a “wake-up call” for Republican lawmakers, telling them that they could not afford to fall behind on fund-raising, as Mr. Saccone did.,Mr. Lamb raised $3.9 million and spent $3 million, compared with Mr. Saccone’s $900,000 raised and $600,000 spent as of Feb. 21. But Republican outside groups swamped the district. Between conservative “super PACs” and the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mr. Saccone had more than $14 million spent on his behalf.,Mr. Lamb got just over $2 million.,As Republican lawmakers spilled out of their morning conference meeting, few seemed willing to come to grips with how much Mr. Trump is energizing Democrats and turning off independent voters. Some of them even argued that Mr. Saccone had managed to make the race close only thanks to the , on Saturday.,“The president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,” said Mr. Ryan.,Others in the conference, however, talked more openly about the political difficulties of breaking with Mr. Trump.,“There is no benefit from running away from the president,” said Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, a member of his party’s leadership, noting that Republican candidates need core conservative voters, a constituency that still backs the president, to show up.,“It doesn’t get them the same thing as Lamb opposing Pelosi,” Mr. McHenry said.,Even Mr. Stivers, who has the task of re-electing a contingent of lawmakers from districts that backed Hillary Clinton, declined to say Republicans should feel free to break from Mr. Trump.,“I am not going to tell anybody to be against the president,” he said.,But turnout levels in the district’s suburban precincts proved crucial for Mr. Lamb, and a handful of Republican House veterans conceded this broader vulnerability.,“We know that’s probably where the president’s appeal is the weakest,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime party strategist, adding: “It’s a pattern we’ve seen throughout.”,But he argued that Mr. Trump’s unpopularity in high-income areas would be less of a drag on incumbents who had their own identity and were steeled for difficult races.,Yet even as most Republicans pinned the blame on Mr. Saccone’s fund-raising weakness or held up Mr. Lamb’s willingness to oppose Ms. Pelosi, refusing to fault Mr. Trump, one retiring lawmaker was more blunt.,“Denial isn’t just a river in Egypt,” said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a frequent critic of the president. “I’ve been through wave elections before.”,Democrats were buoyant at Mr. Lamb’s victory, viewing his upset as both a harbinger of a November wave and perhaps a sign that the party had overcome some of the most stinging Republican attack lines of the Obama years. Polling in both parties found Ms. Pelosi widely disliked among voters in the district, but the Republican ads featuring her apparently failed to disqualify Mr. Lamb.,Mayor Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh, a Democrat, said Mr. Lamb’s campaign showed that the Republicans’ anti-Pelosi playbook had limitations. The race, he said, should embolden Democrats to contest difficult districts in the Midwest with an economic message that appeals to elements of Mr. Trump’s base.,“Conor Lamb was talking about redevelopment and economic growth, and the Republicans were talking about Nancy Pelosi,” Mr. Peduto said. “It’s like they couldn’t help themselves.”,Mr. Peduto urged the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the electioneering vehicle for House Democrats, to expand its target list in the Trump-aligned Midwest.,“Look through the Rust Belt, in areas that used to be blue,” Mr. Peduto said. “If you’re in a congressional district that’s eight, 10 or 12 points carried by Trump, I would hope that the D.C.C.C. is now putting that in the target.”,To the extent that Democrats attempt further incursions into Trump country, it may test their party’s willingness to tolerate Lamb-like deviation on matters like gun control, and perhaps more widespread rejection of Ms. Pelosi.,Democrats in Washington have already faced criticism from liberal activists for intervening in primary elections, in states like Texas and California, to promote candidates that they view as more electable. Putting forward a slate of moderates in Republican areas could prove more controversial than boosting just one in a special election.,Up to this point, however, Democratic leaders and their campaign tacticians have taken a just-win approach, encouraging candidates to attack Mr. Ryan but taking a far more permissive view of party loyalty than their Republican counterparts.,Clarke Tucker, a Democratic state legislator in Arkansas who is challenging Representative French Hill, a Republican, said on Wednesday that he took Mr. Lamb’s victory as a validation of a throw-the-bums-out message he planned to deliver in his own race. Campaigning in a seat that includes Little Rock and its suburbs, Mr. Tucker said he seldom spoke about Mr. Trump and announced up front that he would not back Ms. Pelosi.,Mr. Tucker, who was aggressively recruited by the D.C.C.C., said that he had told Democrats in Washington that he was “very frustrated with the leadership of the House in both parties” and that no one attempted to dissuade him from delivering that message.,“That district is a lot like the one I’m running in,” Mr. Tucker said of Mr. Lamb’s seat. “I think voters are interested in changing the leadership in Washington.”",ALEXANDER BURNS,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 14, 983170)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,"Conor Lamb Wins Pennsylvania House Seat, Giving Democrats a Map for Trump Country",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/politics/democrats-republicans-pennsylvania-special-election.html
"If you’re a murderous dictator, this is a joyous time to be alive.,No one will make much of a fuss if your opposition leader is jailed, if an annoying journalist goes missing or if, ,, a judge who displeases the dictatorial president suffers a home invasion in which goons rape his wife and daughter.,As President Trump replaces Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with the more hawkish Mike Pompeo, let’s note something that goes far beyond personnel to the heart of the American role in the world: The U.S. has abandoned a bipartisan consensus on human rights that goes back decades.,, where leaders are finding that this is also the optimal time to commit genocide. The army conducted a scorched-earth campaign against the Rohingya ethnic minority, with soldiers , as they raped the mothers.,What has Trump said to condemn Myanmar for these atrocities?,.,In the past, human rights was at least one thread of our foreign policy. This was pursued inconsistently, grudgingly or hypocritically, and it jostled constantly with realpolitik considerations, but in the past it was one of the factors in play.,I periodically assailed Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush for not doing more after atrocities in Syria, Darfur or South Sudan, but both Obama and Bush were clearly anguished and frustrated that they didn’t have better tools to stop the slaughter.,In contrast, President Trump seems simply indifferent.,Trump defended Vladimir Putin for killing critics (“What? You think our country’s so innocent?”), and praised Egypt’s brutal president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for “a fantastic job.” Trump hailed the Philippines’s president, Rodrigo Duterte, whose dirty war on drugs has claimed 12,000 lives, for an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.”,Sarah Margon of Human Rights Watch , that when Trump visited Manila, he laughed as Duterte called reporters “spies” — in a country where aggressive journalism has landed people in the morgue.,“In country after country, the Trump administration is gutting U.S. support for human rights,” Margon writes.,So dictators see a clear field: A record number of journalists are in prison worldwide, by the count of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Joel Simon, the organization’s executive director, says Trump has met with the leaders of each of the three top jailers of journalists — China, Russia and Turkey — and as far as we know, has never raised the issue of press freedom with them.,“What’s completely gone is the bipartisan consensus that was a cornerstone of our foreign policy, that if you imprison journalists and restrict the media, there will be consequences,” Simon says.,In Cambodia, Prime Minister Hun Sen , Trump’s attacks on fake news as a precedent for closing down radio stations and the much admired newspaper Cambodia Daily. After the crackdown, in November, Trump posed for a photograph with Hun Sen, flashing a thumbs-up — and Hun Sen praised the American president for his lack of interest in human rights.,“Your policy is being changed,” ,, and he lauded Trump for being “most respectful.”,Trump told the king of repressive Bahrain, “there won’t be strain with this administration.” Nabeel Rajab, a heroic Bahraini who is one of the Arab world’s leading human rights campaigners, , the government responded a few days later by killing five protesters — and, just last month, the government followed up again by , himself to five years in prison for his tweets.,Trump’s soft spot for authoritarianism goes way back. He has spoken sympathetically of the Chinese government’s massacres of pro-democracy protesters in 1989, and of Saddam Hussein’s approach to counterterrorism.,Important human rights jobs in the administration aren’t even filled, although some conservatives are rallying support for the appointment of Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, which would be a good first step.,Periodically, Trump does raise human rights issues, but only to bludgeon enemies like North Korea or Venezuela. This is so ham-handed and hypocritical that it simply diminishes American standing further.,In some respects, Trump has united the world. Against us.,shows that across 134 countries, approval of the United States has collapsed to a record low of 30 percent. Indeed, more people now approve of China than of the United States. Russia is just behind us.,“Trump has been a disaster for U.S. soft power,” says Gary Bass of Princeton University. “He’s so hated around the world that he’s radioactive. So on those rare occasions when he does something about human rights, it only tarnishes the cause.”,This is a tragedy for the United States. But the greatest loss is felt by people who are helpless as loved ones are raped, tortured or murdered. In Myanmar, a young Rohingya man pleaded with me: “Please don’t let us be treated as animals. Please. Please. Don’t break our trust.”,What do we tell him?☐",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 12401)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,"Dictators Love Trump, and He Loves Them",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/trump-dictators-human-rights.html
"The nearly 17-year-old Afghanistan conflict, the longest war in United States history, will not end on the battlefield. It can be resolved only at the negotiating table. So, the , last month from President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan to negotiate with the Taliban “without preconditions” is a welcome initiative. But it faces daunting obstacles.,Mr. Ghani’s proposal envisions an outcome in which the Taliban would be recognized as a legitimate political party, prisoners would be released and United Nations sanctions against the group would be lifted. In exchange, the Taliban would have to recognize the Afghan government and respect the rule of law, including women’s rights.,Secretary of Defense ,, during a surprise visit to Afghanistan this week, said there was evidence that some Taliban factions are interested in talks. The Taliban , to Mr. Ghani’s proposal, but in the past they have refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, which they deem an American puppet. Instead, the Taliban have insisted on direct talks with the United States that exclude the Kabul government, as a way to discredit it. The United States has long supported an Afghan-led peace process, in which Washington might play a role but would not stand in for the Afghan government.,Assuming the Taliban refuse Mr. Ghani’s offer, it’s timely to ask: Is there an alternative to an indefinite United States military presence in Afghanistan?,The fact is the Taliban remain strong, controlling or contesting over a third of the country. Their share continues to grow slowly, despite persistent Afghan and American efforts to weaken them. The early Obama-era surge ,, plus the infusion of an , troops from NATO nations, did not defeat or even permanently debilitate the Taliban.,Late in his administration, President Barack Obama drew down American troops to below 10,000 and focused the mission squarely on counterterrorism, fighting Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, while providing only training, advice and assistance to Afghan forces fighting the Taliban. He ultimately ordered a deadly 2016 strike against the Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, in the hope that his removal would substantially weaken the Taliban. It did not.,Last year, President Trump intensified American airstrikes, increased the United States ground presence by roughly 50 percent and gave his commanders nearly unfettered authority to fight the Taliban. But that has not materially weakened the Taliban, either. Indeed, history has shown that no sustainable number of NATO troops will change the military balance sufficiently to assure an Afghan government victory. The Afghan war remains an “,” in which the Taliban gradually gain ground at the expense of the Kabul government.,Despite Mr. Ghani’s laudable efforts, peace talks remain unlikely to succeed. Successive attempts at negotiations with the Taliban have failed for an array of reasons: the Taliban’s enduring strength on the battlefield and support among some of the rural population; policy disputes within the Taliban that have hamstrung their negotiators; a weak Afghan government split over the wisdom of negotiations; and Pakistan’s duplicitous role in nominally supporting negotiations while sustaining support for the Taliban.,None of these factors has changed. With no realistic prospect for fruitful negotiations, we are waiting for the Taliban to self-destruct or to decide for their own reasons that they are ready to reconcile. In the meantime, the United States has three bad options.,First, the Trump administration could refocus its objectives, returning to the previous administration’s more limited goal of fighting foreign terrorists and providing training, equipment and advice, but not direct combat support, to help the Afghan government control Kabul and other cities. This would enable a reduction in United States forces, while protecting the American diplomatic presence in Kabul and preventing Afghanistan from re-emerging as a major terrorist safe haven. This approach would probably slow, but not halt, the progress of the Taliban.,Second, the United States could withdraw its forces, on the premise that it cannot “win” in Afghanistan. This would leave Afghanistan and the United States vulnerable to a reinvigorated terrorist presence and, perhaps, the replacement of the American-led presence by Russia, Iran, China or India.,In this scenario, the Kabul government would most likely lose more territory to the Taliban and eventually fall. Arguably, the deaths of more than 2,400 American servicemen and women would have been in vain. This choice conjures haunting images of the United States retreat from Saigon in 1975, and no American president has yet been willing to accept this scenario.,Finally, the United States could acknowledge and resolve that its presence in Afghanistan is essentially permanent — but in doing so, it should understand the cost. The United States will stay at whatever troop level our commanders deem necessary to combat terrorists and prop up the Kabul government. Mr. Trump has, in effect, chosen this option at an annual cost of at least $45 billion and about 15,000 American troops. But this approach will not result in the military defeat of the Taliban.,Not surprisingly, Mr. Trump has neglected to explain to the American people that he has signed us up for an indefinite, Korea-style stay in Afghanistan, primarily for the purpose of maintaining stability and — despite his protestations — to conduct military-led nation-building. It remains to be seen if the public and Congress will embrace such a commitment. The Trump administration owes the American people a realistic assessment of the risks and costs of the president’s decisions. He needs to acknowledge that our longest war will go on much longer.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 31965)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Tell the Truth About Our Longest War,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/afghanistan-longest-war.html
"I always thought that Stephen Hawking would outlive me. I broke into tears when I heard on Wednesday that he had not. He , in Cambridge, England, at 76, after more than half a century of living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,When a man is given three years to live at 21, and he dies 55 years later, it shouldn’t come as a shock. But though I’m 15 years younger then Stephen was, and he had been gravely ill for years, if you knew him you couldn’t help thinking that he would always be around, that his life force was inexhaustible, that he would always have another miracle to pull off.,The scientific community rightly makes much of one of his miracles, a discovery he made in 1974 of something now known as Hawking radiation: the phenomenon in which black holes — so named because nothing can escape them — actually allow radiation to get out.,In popular culture Stephen was another kind of miracle: a floating brain, a disembodied intellect that fit snugly into the stereotype of the genius scientist.,But to me Stephen was also the everyday miracle of an ordinary embodied human — albeit one who had to battle in heroic ways within the confines of his particular shell.,What you don’t often hear about Stephen is that he loved a good curry, but not if it was spicy. That he considered himself allergic to gluten, but that he wouldn’t notice when his caregivers occasionally let some slip through. That he ate bananas mashed with kiwi every day. That he had to eat all his food mashed or chopped, and had to be spoon-fed. And that he never let this embarrass him, even when he ate in the finest restaurants.,I began collaborating with Stephen in the early 2000s, not long after I had published my first book. He contacted me to ask if I’d consider working with him on a book — the first of two we would write together. Though I was also a physicist, and had had the good fortune to work alongside other geniuses of the field like Richard Feynman, I was no less awe-struck by the chance to get to know Stephen.,Soon we were collaborating, literally elbow-to-elbow, many hours each day, for days on end. We would talk and debate about physics, and about how best to write about it. But I was also helping to dab his face dry, adjust his glasses, carry him to the couch. And then we’d get back to arguing. With time, our intellectual connection was deepened by that physical intimacy, and we grew close.,Since Stephen couldn’t speak, he communicated through his computer. Composing a sentence was like playing a video game — the cursor would move on the screen, and he would have to capture the letter or word he wanted by pressing on a mouse with his thumb, or, in his later years, moving his cheek to activate a motion sensor in his glasses. When he was done, he would click an icon and his famous computer voice would read what he had typed out.,Stephen could compose his sentences at a rate of only about six words a minute. At first I would sit impatiently, daydreaming on and off as I waited for him to finish his composition. But then one day I was looking over his shoulder at his computer screen, where the sentence he was constructing was visible, and I started thinking about his evolving reply. By the time he had completed it, I had had several minutes to ponder the ideas he was expressing.,This was a great help. It allowed me to more profoundly consider his remarks, and it enabled my own ideas, and my reactions to his, to percolate as they never could have in an ordinary conversation.,When I argued a point of physics with Stephen, I always lost. I would scribble equations on a pad or a whiteboard, trying to sway him, but when I was done, I would find that the answer was the one he had already worked out in his head.,He was no less certain in his ideas about how to write our books, though when we disagreed on those matters, there was no right or wrong answer, only preference. And so we might argue at length — on one occasion we did so for two hours — over a single sentence.,There was an important difference between us here. Making my arguments took little effort. To oppose my ideas, Stephen had to struggle to type every letter of every word. Yet it was I, not he, who ceded points out of exhaustion. Once, during a particularly heated discussion, I waited several minutes for him to respond, and then, when his response finally came, it was a joke. Even when contemplating the cosmic, he had a keen sense of the comic.,Stephen’s expertise was gravitation, the weakest of the four fundamental forces of the universe. Yet Stephen himself was a strong force. When, as a student, he started his work on black holes, most scientists thought it was a dead-end field. His doctors made a similar assessment regarding his prospects in life.,Proving people wrong turned out to be his strength — and his gift to all of us.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 56908)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,"Stephen Hawking, Force of Nature",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/stephen-hawking-death-.html
"This week Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced that they will be ending their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, having found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Trump administration. That’s no surprise: The announcement punctuates a process that has been a sham, falling far short of the , by a bipartisan group of experts (including one of us, Ms. Schneider) last fall for effective, credible congressional investigations.,But for those who may be thinking good riddance, think again. Every indication is that this is far from the end of the committee majority’s mischief. All signs instead point to this week’s developments as the beginning of a new chapter in the story, in which House Republicans go on the offensive to support President Trump — and fight the special counsel, Robert Mueller.,That likely trajectory emerges from plotting the data points before us. First, the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, attempted to provide cover for President Trump’s false , by his predecessor. Mr. Nunes met with White House officials in secret and then held news conferences in which he claimed that the outgoing national security adviser, Susan Rice, and her colleagues had wrongly sought to “unmask” (i.e., identify by name) certain Trump associates in surveillance reports.,When that effort ran out of steam, Mr. Nunes and the majority shifted their attention to the process by which law enforcement agencies obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorization to conduct electronic monitoring of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The committee released a , claiming that the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice had abused their powers — claims which turned out to be unfounded.,Now, with their forthcoming report, the Republicans on the committee have turned their focus to attacking the substance of the Mueller investigation.,The special counsel is examining three core issues: Did Russia attack the 2016 elections to aid Mr. Trump; did Mr. Trump or members of his campaign collude with the Russians to do so; and did Mr. Trump or others obstruct the investigation of these matters? The committee majority report, which has yet to be released but which members of the majority have begun to tease out in recent days, is an attempt to defang the first question, finding against all evidence that the Russian attack was not intended to help Mr. Trump (though a few members of the majority, including Representative Trey Gowdy, have been more equivocal). And the majority report endeavors to gut the second question, declaring the absence of collusion altogether.,It would be a grave error to think the committee will stop here, especially its chairman. There is nothing in Mr. Nunes’s record to suggest that he will let up in the face of opposition, whether from the stray dissenters within his own (still largely compliant) ranks who have emerged, or from the outside. The so-called “Nunes memo,” although , ,, was just the first , that he has said he plans to issue.,Having assailed the first two prongs of the Mueller investigation, we can now expect Mr. Nunes and his colleagues to turn to the third, and the one perhaps most perilous to the president: obstruction of justice. The president and his supporters , that his constitutional power to direct the Justice Department and the F.B.I. and to fire their personnel means he cannot as a matter of law be held accountable for obstructing an investigation. That is wrong; the Supreme Court , that those presidential powers may be curtailed, and American law is replete with , of officials for abusing their undoubted official powers.,Mr. Nunes and his committee majority have demonstrated little regard for such niceties, and we fully expect them to weigh in on the side of the president, and against accountability. Should Mr. Mueller move to compel the president to testify by obtaining a grand jury subpoena, for example, look for them to back arguments circulated by Mr. Trump’s lawyers that the special counsel has not met the threshold for such a step. The fact that Mr. Mueller has accumulated , is unlikely to give the committee majority pause.,We also expect more overt attacks on Mr. Mueller himself, of the kind Representative Nunes has already launched against Obama-era officials for unmasking and the F.B.I. for the warrant against Mr. Page. Mr. Trump and his allies have already floated a long list of , on Mr. Mueller and members of his team, smearing them with allegations of conflicts of interest, bias and abuse of their investigative powers. Now that the House Intelligence Committee majority has done its dirty work on the substance of the Mueller investigation, can picking up these themes to attack the special counsel himself be far behind?,We must in addition look for Representative Nunes and his ilk to back the president should he seek to install a crony in one of the positions within the Justice Department that oversees the Mueller investigation. Why should the president fire the special counsel outright, with the attendant fuss? Mr. Trump instead can try to throttle him by replacing Attorney General Jeff Sessions or his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, with a compliant soul who can slowly choke off Mr. Mueller by cutting his budget, trimming his staff or curtailing the scope of his review. In a week in which there has already been a major cabinet reshuffle, with the firings of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and one of his top aides, Steve Goldstein, the possibility of such a move looms larger — and the likelihood of full-throated backing from Mr. Nunes and company, greater.,The damage the House majority can do here goes beyond mere cheerleading. When Mr. Nunes released his first memo, there were , that it was intended to target Mr. Rosenstein for his alleged role in FISA warrant abuses. When the memo fell flat, the rumors faded away. We would hardly be surprised to see a renewed effort against him — and his boss. Since Mr. Rosenstein oversees Mr. Mueller only because Mr. Sessions has a conflict (he worked on the Trump campaign), the replacement of either would serve Mr. Trump and Mr. Nunes’s malign purposes.,We predict that these and other forms of mischief will continue to flow from a committee majority run amok. Any oversight function that body might have provided as to Trump-Russia matters has been co-opted by the president, with the House Republicans even adopting his lie-ridden methodologies. A dangerous new era of alternative reality is advancing, and House Republicans are signaling that, like their president, they intend to ignore, bend or assail truth to fight the Mueller investigation (and presumably that of the Senate Intelligence Committee as well, should it reach inconvenient conclusions).,The special counsel must gird himself for this battle, and all of us must be ready to defend him. If Tuesday’s apparent victory by the upstart Conor Lamb in a deeply red congressional district in Pennsylvania is any indication, voters may ultimately relieve Mr. Nunes and company of their seats, or at least their power. In the meantime, Americans who are concerned about the integrity of our democracy must speak out against these intolerable efforts to undercut a vital investigation.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 77691)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Beware of Devin Nunes’s Next Move,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/devin-nunes-russia-republicans.html
"BERLIN — After both right- and left-wing populist parties won big in elections this month, Italy is probably headed for a long, tedious effort to form a government; odds are it will include one of them. In Berlin, the Alternative for Germany, known by its German abbreviation AfD, is already sitting in the Bundestag. Across Europe, populists have complicated the political game, which makes the question of how to contain them an even more pressing one — not least in the national legislatures. Germany might have some answers.,On Oct. 24, a month after the general election gave the AfD enough votes to enter the legislature for the first time, the 19th German Bundestag met for its opening session. Ever since, the neo-Classical Reichstag building, northwest of the Brandenburg Gate, has turned into a laboratory of applied political science. The AfD is now the Bundestag’s third-largest caucus, and Bundestag sessions have become experiments: How do you prevent a populist party from turning the floor into its national stage?,In its first four months in Parliament, the AfD has adopted a triple strategy. For one, it stresses common ground with other parties, portraying itself as a “normal” conservative political force. At the same time, it creates controversy outside the Parliament. And if called out or punished, it claims victimization.,On Jan. 27, for example, when the Bundestag commemorated the day of the liberation of Auschwitz, the 92-year-old Holocaust survivor Anita Lasker-Wallfisch spoke to the representatives. The AfD duly applauded. But when she praised the accommodation of refugees as an “incredibly generous, brave and humane gesture,” the ranks of the AfD remained silent.,That may seem a small, depreciating gesture — Germany’s political culture would have demanded at least modest applause. But it has a larger context. The breach comes from a party that counts Björn Höcke in its ranks, a man who called for a “180-degree turn” in Germany’s memorial culture. The AfD’s Bundestag delegation is led by Alexander Gauland, who has praised the “achievements” of Nazi Germany’s soldiers during World War II. This gesture of disrespect is part of the fundamental opposition to the idea that German history still serves as a guiding principle for German policymaking. And its supporters know that.,The motions and proposals the AfD has introduced to the floor in the past four months are an important tool in this triple strategy. Its members have introduced or co-sponsored 26 bills since October, more than Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. Most of them reflect the party’s clear focus on questions of national identity and immigration control.,The AfD is clever at addressing real or apparent common ground with other parties’ positions, to make their proposals look conventional, even irrefutable. The party has proposed, for example, a ban on full veils in public — something that prominent conservative figures in Ms. Merkel’s party have supported, too. A few weeks ago the populists introduced a bill that would enshrine German as the country’s official language in the Constitution. The Christian Democrats adopted this same position in 2010, a fact the sponsor of the bill, Stephan Brandner, doesn’t fail to point out to journalists at the caucus’s weekly news conferences.,It is the party’s strategy, leading figures in the AfD admit, to make the other parties vote against positions they actually share, so that they have a hard time defending their decisions to their constituents. “It’s true that none of our proposals are passing,” said Bernd Baumann, the AfD’s parliamentary coordinator. “But that’s not the point. We are proposing legislation so that everybody knows what we stand for, to put our ideas on the top of Germany’s political agenda.”,On the surface, the AfD’s proposals remain within the mainstream, betraying its nationalist and xenophobic stance only in nuances — for example, by the frequent evocation of notions like “German soil” or “dominant foreign cultures.” Again, it’s the more radical statements outside the Parliament that set the tone. At a rally in February, André Poggenburg, head of the AfD in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, called Germans of Turkish decent “cameleers” and said they should “get back to where they belong, far, far beyond the Bosporus” in Turkey. Albrecht Glaser, an AfD representative at the Bundestag, said at a rally that Islam was a “construction” that “does not know religious freedom and does not respect it — and who treats fundamental rights like this should be deprived of these rights.”,As one of its first acts in Parliament, the AfD nominated Mr. Glaser to be a vice president of the Bundestag (typically, each party is allowed to name at least one vice president). Given his attack on Muslims’ religious rights, the other parties blocked Mr. Glaser’s election, while their own nominees were all approved. The AfD then won headlines when it complained it was being treated unfairly by the sore losers in the establishment. All in all, a tie.,The AfD’s triple strategy of normality, provocation and self-victimization puts the other caucuses on the spot. But there has been some learning by their opponents as well. A broad consensus has emerged among the established parties that it is best to treat the AfD as normally as possible as long as it’s possible. “We must not generally deny them certain positions in the Bundestag,” Thomas Oppermann, the head of the Social Democratic caucus, wrote recently, and indeed the AfD heads three parliamentary committees.,Three strategies can be identified in response to the AfD’s provocations. First, the emotional response: Cem Özdemir, the leader of the Green Party, recently gave a passionate speech on the floor, calling the party “racist.” The video went viral. Second, pointing out the AfD’s inconsistencies wherever it makes mistakes. Third, tackling false allegations with facts: A young representative from the Christian Democrats, Philipp Amthor, responded to the AfD’s proposal to ban full veiling in public with an elaborate account of the rulings both by the German Constitutional Court and by the European Court of Human Rights that would stand against a ban. That video was widely shared, too.,All of these have pros and cons. The emotional response unites your own supporters but evokes an equal reaction on the other side. Pointing out inconsistencies and making a factual argument may work better, but that tends to reach a smaller, wonkier audience. For most hard-core AfD supporters, all three responses fall flat. The AfD has built a strong social-media presence that doesn’t let anything through without adding its own spin.,Four months into the experiment of countering parliamentary populism, it is too early to draw definite conclusions. The AfD’s presence in the Bundestag seems to consolidate, but not increase, its support. In the general election, its share of the vote was 12.6 percent; in February, most polls saw the AfD at 13 percent to 15 percent. But the other side, too, has profited from the party’s presence. It has directed media attention to the Parliament, to which the public usually pays just passing attention. It has invigorated the debates on the floor. It has made a very young backbencher’s speech widely seen.,Much of this is specific to German politics and doesn’t necessarily offer a model for Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries facing a populist incursion in their own Parliaments. But it does show that populist parties can have a positive and invigorating effect on mainstream politics — arguably the first step toward a new turn to the center.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 277915)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,So You’ve Got Populists in Your Parliament.

"In 1813, not long before the end of his reign, Napoleon Bonaparte told the Austrian foreign minister, Count Metternich, the downside of being a strongman. “My reign will not outlast the day I have ceased to be strong and therefore to be feared,” Napoleon said. “Your sovereigns, who were born to the throne, can allow themselves to be defeated 20 times and will always return to their capitals.”,Napoleon knew better than anyone the difficulties of remaining in power forever, particularly if you weren’t born to the throne. Years later, democratic institutions would resolve this problem by making it possible for a defeated leader to return by way of the ballot box. Electoral democracy made clear that the throne is never owned, only leased.,But the spirit of democracy was hardly limited to the idea that the will of the people is expressed through free and fair elections. That rulers should not be encouraged to outstay their welcomes and that their power must always be constrained played an instrumental role in the modern understanding of liberal democracy as well.,But this consensus, forged over centuries, is now being called into question.,Today some of the leaders of the world’s most powerful countries, democracies and non-democracies alike, are fashioning themselves as modern-day emperors. They are concentrating power in their own hands with no plans to leave office in their lifetime. In their view it does not matter whether a country is a democracy or an autocracy; what matters is the quality of its leader. And they have a lot of support: At a time when mistrust of politicians is high, many people see strongman leaders as preferable to a corrupt political establishment.,No example of this trend is clearer or more significant than , by China’s National People’s Congress to abolish presidential term limits. It’s not an exaggeration to say that this move signals the end of democracy’s hegemony as the world’s political ideal.,In the days after President Xi Jinping of China announced his decision to abolish term limits, many analysts concluded that his attempt to become an actual emperor signaled Beijing’s ambition to openly challenge America’s global leadership. This is accurate, but it’s not the full story.,What is rarely discussed in this context is what the political scientist , the “Versailles effect.” Looking at history, Professor Jowitt demonstrates how power can be best measured by the eagerness of others to imitate one’s institutions and lifestyles.,In the 17th century, he argues, Louis XIV of France “created a remarkably powerful and prestigious regime, one mimicked from Germany to Russia, where mini-Versailles were built, French manners adopted, and the French language spoken by the elite.” In the 19th century, Britain’s Parliament became the object of political desire — Hungarians signaled their political ambitions by building a neo-Gothic Parliament building in Budapest as grandiose as the one in London. After World War II, the Stalinist regimes installed in Eastern Europe were all stamped with a similarly imposing and inhumane Stalinist architecture.,After the end of the Cold War, imitating the West signified being on the right side of history. Holding elections and writing American-style Constitutions was as important for the image of the nation as having a smartphone is for the self-esteem of a teenager. For Professor Jowitt, “in the post-Cold War era, playing golf for the non-Western elite was what wearing togas was for the non-Roman elite in the ancient world.”,And constraining a ruler’s power was one of the key ways that non-democracies adjusted to the age of democracy.,That’s why many undemocratic governments insisted on maintaining democratic trappings, in particular elections and term limits. In 2008, for example, Vladimir Putin of Russia resisted the temptation to change the Constitution to allow him a third consecutive term as president because he did not want his country to look like one of the Central Asian republics where presidents never leave their palaces. Even though the system was rigged, undemocratic governments knew it was important to at least pretend it wasn’t. This — rather than the spread of liberal democracy — is the real evidence of democracy’s hegemony. Even China played along.,Until now.,In this sense, the Chinese Communist Party’s decision to abolish presidential term limits will resound far beyond China. One could imagine Mr. Putin convincing himself that leaving the Kremlin in 2024, when his next term would conclude, is no longer necessary. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey may very well also be reassured that he could stay in power indefinitely. Elected leaders around the world could soon rush to tell their voters that a change of leadership is a dangerous idea. New constitutions will be written and old constitutions will be amended to mark the arrival of the new political fashion.,The arrival of this “emperor’s moment” is bad news for Europe, where not having an emperor is at the very heart of the European project. It is also rotten news for the United States. But it may be a boon for President Trump, who could decide that after Americans have taught the Chinese how to play golf, it’s time for Americans to start imitating the Chinese. What if two presidential terms isn’t enough time to make America great again?",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 303557)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Welcome to the Era of Presidents for Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/opinion/presidents-for-life-jinping.html
"Since it opened in Grand Central Terminal in 2016, Claus Meyer’s , has introduced throngs of commuters to such Danish delights as smorrebrod topped with pickled herring, drinks and desserts spiked with sea buckthorn, and cinnamon rolls called kanelsnurrer.,But over at the bar, one Nordic staple remains largely undiscovered: aquavit, the traditional Scandinavian spirit flavored with caraway or dill. There is only one aquavit cocktail on the menu, and only two at Agern, Mr. Meyer’s upscale New Nordic restaurant next to the food hall. Though aquavits are available neat at both places, they are mostly an afterthought.,At ,, a bartender seemed genuinely surprised when I ordered several Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic aquavits from the back bar. She had to check with the manager about the price of one, since no one else had ever ordered it from her.,“For Americans, traditional aquavit can be a little too heavy on the caraway,” said Jonas Andersen, the food hall’s beverage manager, referring to the seed that typically gives the drink its signature spicy bite. “But mezcal was an acquired taste, too. Now we love mezcal, and it’s one of our friends.”,The relative lack of interest in aquavit in the United States is not surprising. In Scandinavia, the spirit has struggled to find popularity among a younger generation that has embraced American-style cocktails.,But the same spreading curiosity that has brought attention to traditional spirits , and gin is giving aquavit a new life — starting with craft distillers, both here and in the Nordic countries, who are making fresh expressions of the liquor.,“Younger bartenders and connoisseurs are rediscovering aquavit,” said Thomas Klem Andersen, whose blog Cocktails of Copenhagen covers the city’s bar scene. “After years of hype about whiskey, rum and gin, many of us are exploring what’s in our own backyard.”,Aquavit, or akvavit (literally “water of life”), is produced from a distilled grain or potato spirit and must be flavored predominantly with caraway or dill. There are usually other ingredients in the mix — like anise, fennel seed, cumin, cardamom and citrus peels — but the caraway or dill must be the lead botanical. (Aquavit is often referred to casually as “snaps,” but not all snaps can legally be aquavit; snaps is a more general term that includes spirits with flavors like berries, nuts, peppers or horseradish.),Aquavit is one of the few spirits in the world that’s traditionally paired with food. In Denmark, ,’s red-label taffel (or “table”) bottling is classically served at lunch, chilled and neat alongside smorrebrod and pickled herring, backed by a Tuborg or Carlsberg beer. In Norway, there are special bottlings to pair with specific dishes such as herring, lutefisk and ,.,In essence, aquavit is like a gin flavored with caraway or dill rather than juniper. Given the current popularity of craft gins, it’s surprising that aquavit has not quite found a wider audience. In Denmark, a number of smaller, craft distillers are experimenting with aquavits that ratchet up the juniper flavor, while keeping the necessary caraway character.,Even the New Nordic culinary movement, led by chefs like , and restaurateurs like Mr. Meyer, hasn’t given aquavit its modern reinterpretation or experimental spin the way they did with so many other traditional Nordic ingredients.,Still, aquavit is the best-selling spirit in Denmark and Norway, by a long stretch. In Norway, where the domestic market is robust, aquavits are a premium liquor, traditionally aged in sherry casks and enjoyed after dinner like a Cognac or Scotch.,, a Norwegian company that is the largest aquavit producer in the world with more than 60 percent of the market, produces the best-known brand, ,. Available in the United States, its casks are famously carried aboard ships that cross the Equator twice before it is sold, to mellow the spirit. The voyage date and ship are listed on every label.,Linie is just one of more than 40 aquavits available in Norway. Arcus expects to introduce one of its top labels, Opland, aged two years, to the United States in the near future.,But in Denmark, many fear that as an older generation passes on, their love of aquavit will not be inherited by the next.,“We have this stigmatized relationship with aquavit, from when we all drank so many shots at Christmas lunch and then threw up,” said Rasmus Poulsgaard, a Copenhagen drinks consultant and co-author of “Akvavit — Rediscovering a Nordic Spirit.” “Most older drinkers are super users. You’d need to recruit 18 new young drinkers when you lose one super user.”,Some of aquavit’s stagnation can be blamed on corporate neglect. From 1999 to 2008, Aalborg — Denmark’s best-selling aquavit — was owned by V&S, the Swedish state-owned monopoly, which was then bought by Pernod Ricard, ostensibly to acquire Absolut vodka. The aquavit brand languished under Pernod Ricard’s watch. Arcus bought the brand in 2013.,As a result, Aalborg aquavit largely sat out the cocktail renaissance that began a decade ago, when bartenders and drinkers discovered all sorts of new spirits. Because of this missed opportunity, aquavit innovation was first driven by small craft producers in Denmark.,“We need to save aquavit from itself,” said Sune Risum-Urth, a brand ambassador at ,, and Mr. Poulsgaard’s co-author. The craft distillery has added ingredients to its aquavits such as Indonesian hot peppers, smoked bacon and even the jawbone from an Angus oxen. Others are experimenting with aging in whiskey or rum barrels.,In the United States — aside from Aalborg, Linie and the Swedish brand O.P. Anderson — the most widely available aquavits are Krogstad, produced by , in Portland, Ore., and ,, from Minnesota, the best example of a dill-forward aquavit one can find in the United States. Krogstad makes both aged and unaged styles, with an American twist of adding star anise to mingle with the caraway.,Arcus, as the biggest player, has embraced craft aquavit. The company now promotes its dill aquavit, Dild, which is popular among Copenhagen bartenders. In Norway, at its Atlungstad distillery, Arcus has a young team distilling small batches of juniper-forward aquavit and one infused with butter.,In August, Arcus sponsored Spirikum, a snaps and aquavit festival where two dozen craft producers from Nordic countries, and a few from the United States, gathered at Copenhagen Distillery. This type of cooperation between large and small companies rarely happens with spirits like whiskey or vodka. “We have to have an open-door policy with the smaller producers,” said Lars Kragelund, Arcus’s technical brand director for Aalborg. “We have to unite our forces.”,In the United States, interest in aquavit may take a while to grow.,“It’s very tempting for aquavit producers to jump on the New York train right way,” said Jonas Andersen, of the food hall in Grand Central. “We need a young generation in Scandinavia to get excited about aquavit before it gets popular in New York.”,Aquavit is harder to find in the United States than in Nordic countries, but here are five varieties that are more widely available.

"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand’s foreign ministry censured its second-ranking envoy to the United States on Wednesday after she tweeted that the Democratic Party in America should get its act together “or we will all die.”,Caroline Beresford, New Zealand’s deputy high commissioner to the United States, and second in charge to the ambassador, Tim Groser, has since made her Twitter account private, with the news website , that her tweets had been deleted.,Responding to an opinion piece from the politics website The Hill, titled “A Sanders-Warren ticket could win big in 2020,” Ms. Beresford responded on Twitter, “No it couldn’t.”,“Please get your” — and here she used an expletive — “together or we will all die,” she wrote. That was apparently in response to the suggestion that two senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, could form a presidential ticket for the 2020 election to defeat President Trump.,The two senators are among the most liberal in Congress and have fervent supporters, but some Democrats fear that putting them on a presidential ticket would turn off moderate voters.,Minutes before her provocative tweet, Ms. Beresford tweeted about the same article in The Hill, saying of Democrats, “They’ve learned nothing.”,A spokesman for New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, said he had been advised of the matter Wednesday, and was “confident the ministry is responding in an appropriate way.”,Discussing Ms. Beresford’s acts, New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that there were “very clear expectations of staff” that they “maintain political neutrality and care in expressing personal opinion” when making public comment, and that had “not been met” in this case.,“The ministry does not in any way endorse the content or tone of the tweets, which we note were deleted,” a spokeswoman said, adding the ministry was taking “appropriate action.”,Ms. Beresford did not respond to a request for comment.

"Theater stands or falls on whether or not vocalized language has power. Sung or spoken, the words of a play must move us if it is to succeed. It is no surprise, then, that playwrights frequently use profane language — curses, expletives, oaths and epithets — in their work. Such words, we think, make an impact.,The use of profanity onstage is nothing new, but this past year there seemed to be epic amounts of mouthing off. In the last five months two of the reigning poets of profanity, Stephen Adly Guirgis and Martin McDonagh, have had plays staged in New York. Mr. McDonagh’s , is a lesson in how to curse artfully; Jesse Green, a New York Times theater critic, called Mr. Guirgis’s “Jesus Hopped the ‘A’ Train,” an ,Younger playwrights provided their fair share of profanities as well, including James Presson’s “____Marry Kill,” staged last fall at the New Ohio Theater, and Halley Feiffer’s “Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow,” which debuted at the Williamstown Theater Festival over the summer.,And in , which runs through April 1, God himself sprays a few expletives of his own.,What, exactly, does cursing do for a playwright?,“All things being equal, the most physiologically affecting language is profanity,” ,, a professor of cognitive science at the University of California, San Diego, said in an interview. “Your heart rate increases, your pupils dilate, you start sweating. We call this a state of emotional arousal. Hearing the most taboo language induces this effect much more strongly than other powerful positive or negative words.”,But in theater, it is not enough to just include dirty words to get a response from the audience. Obscenities must serve a purpose.,Mr. Guirgis said he uses curse words to depict reality. he said.,Mr. Guirgis works hard, he said, to make sure his characters’ cursing doesn’t overshadow the rest of the play. “I pare it down so that the meat doesn’t get obscured by the gravy. The meat and veg and gravy have to fit together. Often expletives or cursing is a part of that. It’s a seasoning. I just try to get it so it’s right.”,“There are places, however, that playwrights feel they can’t go. Mr. Guirgis is reluctant to use racial epithets in his work, so he sometimes opts for an interchangeable profanity instead, as in the case of the title of his breakout play, “The ___________ With the Hat,” which ran on Broadway in 2011.”,Though profanity does sometimes help create a sense of verisimilitude, it can also be employed to punch up everyday speech. A sentence or phrase that might otherwise be flat can become, as if by magic, hilarious, heartbreaking or even beautiful when a curse word is inserted into it.,“You get to a place where what things mean literally doesn’t serve your expressive purpose,” said Michael Adams, the author of “In Praise of Profanity” and a professor of English at Indiana University, Bloomington. “Metaphors aren’t even helping you anymore. You just have to reach beyond that to something that is ultimately expressive non-literally, and for us that is often profanity.”,In Mr. Presson’s “____ Marry Kill,” expletives serve to both capture the way real teenagers speak and also to turn a story of adolescent depravity into a “Jacobean Revenge Comedy” (the play’s subtitle).,Mr. Presson’s characters may use the same swear words that many American teenagers do, but the way they use them is entirely different.,“We’re always really trying to get to the musicality of the language and the rhythms — to in some ways invoke the verse of Elizabethan and post-Elizabethan texts,” he said. “We’re referencing the way speech is used in that era, where you have puns and double meaning and repeated things.”,The musicality of bad language is taken to another level in “Jerry Springer — The Opera” at the Pershing Square Signature Center. The profanities may be familiar, but they’re rarely sung by trained opera singers.,“You’ve got two languages happening at the same time — the language of words and the language of music — and it’s the contrast that really makes it work,” said Richard Thomas, the main creator of the show’s music and lyrics. “For a thing that puerile to be afforded such grandiosity makes it land, makes it delicious.”,While he delights in the disjunction between the beauty of his show’s music and the often obscene content of its lyrics, Mr. Thomas encourages performers to ignore it. “I tell the actors to forget the profanity,’’ he said. “I tell them to focus on the transcendent nature of what you’re singing. That’s more important than the scatological or profane text you’re articulating.”,Kevin McCollum, the producer who controls the transfer rights to “Jerry Springer — The Opera,” said he does not think the show’s profanity negatively affects its commercial viability.,“What gets a show to Broadway is that people are talking about it,” he said. “All good theater and all popular theater must reflect the time in which it is not only created, but also performed.”,Strong language can backfire, however, with critics and audiences sometimes reacting differently than the playwright intended.,David Bar Katz said he felt that some audience members weren’t able to recover from the obscenities used in the opening scene of his 2011 Labyrinth Theater Company production, ,“A lot of the audience never came back from that scene,” he said. “It was supposed to be comedic but it’s incredibly profane. They don’t know what to do with it.” Mr. Katz said he learned something from the experience: “If you’re trying to elicit a certain reaction and if profanity is not serving you, then you, as a disciplined artist, have to find another way.”,Some playwrights contend that they’re particularly vulnerable to criticism for their use of profanity. Ms. Feiffer, who has had several prominent Off Broadway productions, said that she thinks female playwrights are more likely to be taken to task for the practice than their male counterparts are.,“I feel pretty strongly that female playwrights are basically lauded when we write plays that fall into the category of ‘feminine’: plays that are more flowery in their language or use pretty metaphors or kooky imagery,” she said. “When we write more in the muscular, high-octane and, yes, profane vein of playwrights who are considered ‘masculine’ — Mamet, McDonagh, Stephen Adly Guirgis — we’re sort of slapped on the wrist.” (Both Mr. Mamet and Mr. McDonagh declined to be interviewed for this article.),Dialogue is one thing, but as Mr. Guirgis’s Broadway show demonstrated, unprintable titles bring their own extra challenge, as publications (like this one) have standards that don’t allow for their use.,With a curse word in the title, getting the word out about the play itself can be difficult. That may be the situation for Tori Sampson, who is getting a prime Off Broadway slot in the Playwrights Horizons season in 2019.,Ms. Sampson said she had been warned by her mentor, the playwright Sarah Ruhl, that the title could cause problems, but she was still somewhat taken aback when several publications omitted all or some of it. She experienced the omission, she said, as a form of censorship, which she felt especially strongly as a female playwright and a person of color.,“The theater is a place where people can fully express themselves,” she said. “There’s really no limit to what you can do, so it shocked me that there are gatekeepers to language in theater.”,Her new play — “If Pretty Hurts Ugly Must Be a _______” — opens in February 2019.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 506988)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Curses!

"This four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath brick house with a Spanish tile roof and an attached two-car garage is on a secluded mountainside in the south central Mexican city of Cuernavaca, where Aztec emperors once had homes. Known as Quinta Oliver, the 1982 house was designed by the Mexican architect Manuel Parra, who gave each room a niche, a slanted wall, an alcove or some other distinctive feature.,The 10,000-square-foot house sits behind iron gates and a stucco-and-brick arched entryway, on nearly an acre of terraced lawns and tropical gardens with lush vegetation. It is the largest of three homes in a walled 6.85-acre compound that can be bought separately or together (for $10.5 million), said Laura de la Torre de Skipsey, an agent with ,, which has the listing. There is also a single-story, two-bedroom building down the driveway that could be used as staff quarters, an office or a guesthouse.,To reach Quinta Oliver’s intricately carved wooden front doors, visitors cross a brick-and-stone courtyard, ascend stone steps with blue-and-white-tiled risers, and pass two brick arches and a chiseled, blow-torched and painted tile wall mural. Inside, a massive carved lintel of Mexican cantera stone faces the library and adjacent vestibule. Dark volcanic rock tiles are sporadically interlaced with the red glazed tile that covers the floors. Hand-stenciled designs can be seen between ceiling beams throughout the house. And mantels, beams, arches, tiles and stone reclaimed from demolished houses punctuate the home’s various spaces.,From the vestibule, a stone staircase turns past a landing with a French-style arched stone window toward an upstairs sitting room. To one side is the master suite, which has a study area and a stone fireplace on an angled wall. A dressing room hall leads to a blue-and-white-tiled bathroom with an oval tub, a marble-topped vanity, a French-style leaded-glass window and a round cupola ceiling of tile and glass. To the other side of the landing is a den with a fireplace. Two sizable bedrooms have walk-in closets and en-suite baths with handcrafted tiles from Guanajuato.,On the main level, a living room with a stone fireplace is between a smaller music room and a dining room with a crystal chandelier and furniture from an old Mexico City estate. (Some furnishings are included in the price.) The dining room opens to a beamed, covered terrace overlooking a large covered outdoor kitchen pavilion with double barbecue grills, beside the pool.,A cavernous indoor kitchen has beamed barrel ceiling, a dark-stained white cedar counter on the sink side and a counter with handcrafted tiles from Puebla surrounding the stove. The center island has a marble countertop, and the appliances are stainless steel.,The adjoining breakfast room opens to an L-shaped terrace with a fireplace and views of the pool area and a fountain on a lower-level terrace. Tucked behind double doors off the terrace is a guest suite with a living room, bedroom, kitchen and bar.,The swimming pool is surrounded by gardens and has an underwater glass window, originally used to shoot TV commercials.,“It is a beautiful house for entertaining,” Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said.,The property is in the Palmira neighborhood of Cuernavaca, where there are other large homes and estates. Cuernavaca, which has a population of about 366,000, is the capital of the state of Morelos and is known as the City of Eternal Spring, for its temperate climate. Golf courses, language schools and spas abound. The property is about a 20-minute drive from the restaurants, boutiques, tropical gardens and historic buildings downtown. Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico City is about 60 miles away, or an hour and a half drive.,Housing prices in Mexico dropped 20 percent during the global economic downturn, and the increase in kidnappings and other crime over the last decade have hurt the real estate market as well.,But Cuernavaca stands somewhat apart from the rest of the country, as there “has always been a constant attraction for Mexico City residents to own or rent a weekend home” there, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said. The area has a similar appeal “to foreigners, for their retirement or just for the weather and its beauty,” she added.,In the last five years, she said, the volume of sales in Cuernavaca has increased by 40 percent. And the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico last fall, adversely affecting the housing market in nearby Jojutla and other areas of the state of Morelos, didn’t seem to have much effect on the luxury market in Cuernavaca, which Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey defined as homes priced upward of $1.5 million.,Even so, Cuernavaca is still “definitely a buyer’s market,” said Andrea Dolch Espinosa de los Monteros, an owner of the real estate agency ,.,“The American dollar goes a long way,” she said, and prices are negotiable. And inventory will continue to increase in the future, she added, as “there is more development and more construction happening.”,At the low end, three-bedroom homes with two to three bathrooms, a small garden and a pool start at around $200,000, Ms. Espinosa de los Monteros said. In the middle of the market, $500,000 will buy a house with three to four bedrooms and three bathrooms on up to a quarter-acre lot with a pool. “Everyone has a pool,” she said.,At the high end of the market, “haciendas in beautiful shape” on an acre or two can go for as much as $6 million, particularly if they have amenities like state-of-the-art movie theaters, marble bathrooms or tennis courts, Ms. Espinosa de los Monteros said.,Most international buyers of second homes prefer to buy in the prime neighborhoods of Cuernavaca, like Palmira, Tabachines and Sumiya, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said.,In recent months, Cuernavaca has seen an influx of buyers from Mexico City, where damage from the earthquake was more severe, said Yanina Pozos, an agent with Inmobiliaria del Sol, adding that the lighter traffic and lower congestion have long been a draw.,Many foreign buyers come from Canada and the United States, particularly California and the Northeast, agents said. Some are year-round residents, while others are snowbirds.,Though most foreign buyers pay cash, mortgages and cross-border loans are available.,Foreigners are allowed to buy inland property, in cities like Cuernavaca, with a permit from the Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But foreigners who want to buy property within 30 miles of the coast or 60 miles of the border must go through a bank trust or set up a Mexican company.,A public notary, or government-appointed lawyer, chosen by the buyer certifies the real estate transaction for both parties, handling the title search, overseeing any taxes that are due and reviewing official documents, including the deed, property assessment, appraisal and any permits. But buyers are advised to get advice from an independent lawyer as well.,Cuernavaca government: ,Mexican tourism: ,Spanish; Mexican peso (1 peso = 5 cents),The buyer pays the transfer tax, the notary fees and expenses, with closing costs ranging from 5 to 7 percent of the purchase price.

"THE CROISSANTS OF , — a delivery-only pastry service in San Francisco, run by a husband and wife who decline to reveal their identities — appear like a new species startled in the wild. One is striped blue, with a coif of cotton candy in hydrangea hues and a lode of chile-enflamed orange curd waiting to be unleashed; another, ringed in deep purple, flaunts a lavender shard of ube (purple yam) like a lone, useless wing. They are originals, yet they don’t exist in isolation: Others of their kin — that is, pastries in thrillingly deviant forms with classical French lineage but non-canonical ingredients (often drawn from Asian cuisines), as likely to be savory as sweet — can be spotted at , in Los Angeles, confettied in nori; at , in Toronto, blackened by charcoal under a rosy crust of mentaiko (cod roe); and at , in New York, piped with rum crème pâtissière and pineapple jelly in a mirage of a piña colada.,Is this blasphemy or natural evolution? It’s not the first time pastries have undergone mutations in recent history. Nearly five years ago, the French-trained pastry chef Dominique Ansel ,, that cannily named , sold from , in SoHo, New York. Hordes lined up before dawn for limited-batch runs that vanished within the hour, to be resold on the black market by scalpers at a 1,900-percent markup (as much as $100 each). The Cronut was fetishized, then scorned for being fetishized, then imperfectly and ubiquitously reproduced. Dunkin’ Donuts , (of a version that a corporate spokesman insisted had been in development for decades). Within a year, the oracular science-fiction writer William Gibson , a novel forecasting a future in which Cronuts were churned out by 3-D printers.,And still people line up for Ansel’s Cronuts today, at his outposts in Tokyo, London and Los Angeles, where seasonal flavors like pineapple-chocolate-basil and eggnog-caramel are introduced monthly, for we are not yet immune to the novelty of pastry portmanteaus. The cruffin, made of croissant dough fastidiously draped in muffin tins to achieve a bouffant’s rise, was invented the same year as the Cronut by the pastry chef Kate Reid of , in Melbourne, Australia. When another Melbourne native, Ry Stephen (currently of New York’s Supermoon), started making the puffy hybrids at San Francisco’s , in 2014, his curd-filled cruffins proved so popular that a burglar broke in one night and ignored the cash register and equipment, grabbing only a binder of recipes.,Like the Cronut, these latter-day pastries — rustic kouign-amanns at Sugarbloom laminated with white miso; éclairs at patisserie , entombed under Day-Glo plaques of painted chocolate — draw skepticism in part because they’re so swiftly and widely worshiped. In a culture beholden to images, it’s easy to simultaneously embrace and dismiss them as idle provocations. But for all the black garlic in the dough, the kimchi-spiked filling, the blood orange slices mashed on top, they are still viennoiserie, made in accordance with French tradition, precision-engineered with high-grade butter. (Stephen, for instance, is faithful to the revered Beurre d’Isigny, imported from Normandy.) In the croissants and their variations, the layers are as distinct as ribs, from slabs of cold butter immured in fold after fold of dough; the interior resembles a honeycomb of air, due to steam released during baking as the butter slowly melts.,Some mock these as “Frankenpastries,” a term with echoes of “Frankenfood,” coined in 1992 by an English professor at Boston College expressing dismay over genetically engineered crops. That label is tongue-in-cheek, though just as Mary Shelley’s fevered novel hints at societal fears of miscegenation and “impurity,” the notion that these baked goods represent unholy unions suggests that there are clear borders in the culinary world that one ought not cross. Two centuries ago, the French led a shift from free-form cooking to codified techniques and built a system for achieving and recognizing mastery that still defines the professional kitchen, pastry or otherwise. So inevitably it’s the croissant that’s seen as being in danger of degradation: the noble, labor-intensive French pastry sullied by its union with the crude, arriviste American doughnut or muffin. (Another iteration was unveiled in January by , in San Francisco: the tacro, a savory pork- or chicken-stuffed taco with a croissant shell.),YET THE CROISSANT itself was born of crossed borders. The butter-laden layered dough has roots in medieval Arab practice, and the pastry’s shape comes from the Viennese kipferl, said to have been modeled after the Islamic crescent borne on the banners of 17th-century Ottoman invaders. (Although this back story is likely apocryphal, in 2013 a rebel stronghold in Syria banned croissants as symbols of colonialism.) Few dishes, let alone desserts, have remained static over time: Blancmange, a molded milk pudding, was once a chicken casserole; craggy coconut Italian-Jewish macaroons share ancestry (going back to early Sicilian pasta) with the polished round French macarons that have ruffled hems, which languished as solitary disks until someone sandwiched them around ganache a little over a century ago.,If anything, today’s nouvelle pastries mark a return to the spirit championed by Marie-Antoine Carême, the early 19th-century forefather of French cooking, inventor of the soufflé and the croquembouche and architect of monumental confectionery centerpieces that rose up to three feet — nearly as high as the sculptured hairstyles of his late namesake, Marie Antoinette, the Austrian princess whose own love for viennoiserie may have inspired the myth of her declaring, “Let them eat cake.” Carême has disciples in Paris today, including ,, known for éclairs ornamented with edible silver, popcorn and Mona Lisa eyes; ,, conjurer of macarons that taste like bubble gum; and, of course, ,, who daubs raspberry-lychee pâté inside croissants and showers them with candied rose petals. Like the original viennoiserie, which were painstakingly elegant pastries designed for the Hapsburg court in imperial Vienna that eventually became indispensable to the city’s sidewalks, their decadence is matched by the virtuosity of their construction and their element of surprise: They are, then as now, as much for beholding as for eating.,Their contemporary allure is aided by the diminishment of desserts at midrange restaurants, which after the recession of 2008 began to shed pastry chefs, unable to justify the expense for a course that yields little profit. As restaurant desserts have become simpler and homier — olive-oil cake, anything with chocolate — once plainspoken baked goods have turned rococo, offering an aura of luxury, enhanced by how difficult they are to procure before selling out each morning. At $4 to $8 each, these small but elaborate edifices seem worthier than the run-of-the-mill pastries available at every urban corner deli and curbside coffee cart, enabling their artisans to cover the ever-increasing cost of basic ingredients, particularly butter, whose price hit a historic high last year.,Indeed, French butter, which has a higher percentage of fat and a pronounced tang from cultured cream, is so desirable across the globe, it’s , from grocery shelves in France. This is partly because more people are making pastries than ever before; as a French professor explained to The Economist in November, “China has discovered croissants.” But if the trend continues, the croissant as we know it — a straightforward compact of butter, flour, milk, sugar, yeast and salt — may be no more. And in its place? These overgrown crescents too big to fit in the palm of the hand, spangled and swagged, glutted with fillings, arrayed like objets d’art in austere concrete-walled patisseries where the bakers fuss like apothecaries. They’re absurd until you try them: salty and sweet and shattering everywhere, leaving behind smears of cream and telltale butter fingerprints. The croissant is dead; long live the croissant.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 790986)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Vive le Croissant!,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/t-magazine/food/croissant-hybrid-cronut-frankenpastries.html
"Dietary supplements aren’t exactly new news. The supplement market in the U.S. is currently worth $133 billion, according to Zion Market Research, and a crop of new start-ups like Care/Of and Ritual will now deliver personalized vitamin assortments to your doorstep. Formulas with more holistic ambitions, focused on wellness and beauty, have also been steadily on the rise.,Last fall, Gwyneth Paltrow entered the game with a line of five supplements, including , ($60), a powder infused with antioxidants — CoQ10 and vitamin C among them — that promises to revitalize your complexion and defend against oxidative damage.,But the star ingredients of the latest supplements are less frequently spotted on drugstore shelves. Riding the wave of interest around clean eating as a means to looking better, a new offering of capsules and powders is harnessing the power of obscure superfoods and powerful nutrients — from restorative purslane to skin-balancing probiotics.,For example, there’s been a spike in supplements formulated to regulate your digestive system. Rose-Marie Swift, the makeup artist and founder of the natural brand RMS Beauty, has long been a raw-food enthusiast and is known for meticulously researching her ingredients. Last month, she launched her first line of supplements. The , ($64) contains proteases to “help break down your food, allowing for better nutrient absorption,” Swift explains, which in turn lightens your metabolic load, and is also “very anti-aging for the body.” Or consider naturopathic doctor Nigma Talib’s , ($65), a capsule filled with 10 billion strains of lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 — one of the most well-researched probiotics, she says, and something of a superstar bacteria — to balance your gut, along with anti-aging grape seed extract. In April, the London-based practitioner will release Beauty in a Bottle, a mix of vitamins to strengthen hair, skin and nails, as well as Skin Immortal Collagen Plus, an ingestible form of firming collagen.,For the truly committed, it would seem no ingredient is off the table. The German physician Barbara Sturm, M.D. starts her day with a fresh glass of purslane, the leafy green that’s found in her skin care products, to fight wrinkle-causing inflammation. Realizing that this tonic might not be for everyone, she created , ($95), a tablet with a concentrated dose of the plant that’s also rounded out with skin-protecting Japanese knotweed root and hydrating glucosamine. “It’s an efficient way to ingest a high level of antioxidants, in a very compact pill,” notes New York City dermatologist Rachel Nazarian, M.D. “It’s likely useful for anti-aging.” And purslane is no common weed, she says. “It has significant amounts of beta-carotene, vitamin C and antioxidants,” along with “high levels of omega-3 fatty acids — five times higher than spinach.”,For Europeans, taking superfood supplements is far from a fringe concept. Pharmacies there have been stocking detoxifying milk thistle and skin-renewing spirulina for quite some time, alongside other body-enhancing fixes like cellulite creams and compression tights. The cult Parisian skin care brand Biologique Recherche recently teamed up with French nutritionist Pascale Modaï to create , ($111), a medicinal-sounding pill formulated with Griffonia simplicifolia plant extract and an amino acid — together they work as precursors to dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin, which might regulate mood and motivation.,Beauty supplements are still a bit of a wild card — they’re unregulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the results might only stem from a placebo effect. Jenifer Johnson, M.D., an internal medicine physician in Rye, New York recommends running anything you plan to take long-term by an expert. She adds: “I would rather see people invest the time and energy into improving their diet than trying to find it all in a pill.”",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 932601)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Next-Generation Superfood Supplements — With Beauty Benefits,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/t-magazine/superfood-supplements.html
"Whenever the international auto show circuit arrives in Frankfurt, Tokyo or Detroit, the exhibition halls brim with national pride as the host nation’s automakers assemble elaborate displays. But when the industry convenes to introduce its newest offerings in Geneva each year, there are no native brands to lay claim to a home-court advantage.,This unusual circumstance — neutral territory in a sophisticated multilingual city — confers a special character on the ,, which opens to the public on Thursday after two days of press previews. The show runs through March 18 at the Palexpo convention center.,Swiss prosperity, so evident in Geneva, sets the tone, and for the show’s 88th edition there is plenty of cause for optimism. Passenger vehicle sales in the European Union , in 2017, topping 15 million for the first time since 2007, and the trend continued into 2018. The year started with a , over year-ago sales in January and ,, the increases coming largely from demand for sport-utility vehicles.,The challenge of stricter carbon dioxide regulations is evident in a flood of new fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, as well as a ,. The advance of electrification to crossover vehicles, luxury sedans and even spinoff brands will be apparent to visitors throughout the Palexpo arena.,Here is a rundown of what show visitors can expect to see in Geneva.,At any auto show, a visit to the Alfa Romeo display is always an immersion in passionate Italian style. Especially worth checking in Geneva will be the latest changes to the Stelvio S.U.V. and Giulia sedans, both much admired by reviewers. Confirming that the passion extends beyond the body and interior design is the performance story. At the top of the Alfa food chain are the Quadrifoglio editions with twin-turbo V6 engines of over 500 horsepower.,Alpine may be part of the Renault family, but it has its own display in Geneva — and a distinctive identity. The nameplate has been applied to lightweight sports cars for more than half a century, but its modern revival with the A110 dates back just two years. Think of it as a French Porsche Cayman, with its mid-mounted turbo 4-cylinder engine and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Two new variations arrive in Geneva: the lightweight A110 Pure and a touring-focused A110 Légende.,The esteemed British gentleman’s brand hardly needs to remind enthusiasts of its status, yet the company keeps delivering fresh variations and all-new editions. At Palexpo, the latest Vantage, powered by a Mercedes-AMG 4-liter V8, will make its debut, taking care of the entry end of the company’s range. Also on hand for ogling will be the GTE racecar version of the Vantage, the DB11 Coupe and Volante, and the new Aston Martin Red Bull Formula One car.,The center of attention at Audi’s display is likely to be the fifth-generation A6, which is sure to carry on the family look, borrowing details from the A7 and A8. The bigger story may be the tech features and the improved dynamics from a new chassis that trims weight. There will, of course, be E-tron design studies from previous auto shows to examine, the line of Q5 and Q7 S.U.V.s, and the RS and R8 sports machines.,The Bavarians will arrive in Geneva with a full complement of 5 Series and 7 Series sedans as well X Series S.U.V.s, M cars and i models. BMW is expected to have several surprises, but much of the attention will be lavished on the world premiere of the second-generation X4, the coupelike utility vehicle that gives away some practicality for fashion. Speculation, and anticipation, run high that a further development of the Z4 Concept, seen last summer at the Pebble Beach concours, will be unveiled. The show will also be a first opportunity for most mortals to see the Roadster version of the i8.,On the streets of a wealth center like Geneva, Ferraris are simply special, not especially rare. But their mystique elicits envious glances, so models like the 812 Superfast and Portofino (which replaces the California) can be expected to be at the center of a swarm of admirers, while more practical-minded oligarchs might flock to the GTC4Lusso. Still, it will be the new 488 Pista, pushed past 210 miles per hour by its 710-horsepower V8, that’s surrounded by the fantasy-league racers.,Mass-market models will be the emphasis of Ford’s display, including a Euro-edition of the new Edge, the new Ka+ Active and a sizable offering of updated models, including the Mustang. Show visitors may be walking right past all of those cars, though, on their way to the GT supercar, which will be shown in road and racing configurations.,The latest Honda CR-V, which will be available as a hybrid, will share floor space with three concepts, the Urban EV, Sports EV and NeuV EV. They are worth a close look because Honda has committed to delivering a fully electric production model in 2019, and one of these may well be the basis for that E.V. There’s some fast and noisy fun from Honda, too. The Civic Type R TCR, destined for the touring car racing series, will be showcased, as will the NSX GT3. Finally, a rugged edition of the Jazz (known as the Fit in the United States) will be introduced under the X-Road label.,The all-hands presence of Hyundai in Geneva is a telling sign of the South Korean automaker’s continuing ambitions. Several world premieres are on the automaker’s schedule, the most important of which is the fourth-generation Santa Fe crossover. Hyundai’s intentions to expand its market footprint may be more evident in the Kona subcompact crossover, which gets a fully electric version with a not-to-be-ignored 290-mile range. For anyone who’s still not taking the company’s green theme seriously, the Nexo fuel-cell vehicle could seal the deal. It’s built on a new platform specifically engineered for zero-emissions hydrogen power. The Hyundai exhibit also offers an Internet of Things cockpit display and a technical breakdown of fuel-cell operation.,The reason it seems that years have passed since we first heard about an all-electric crossover from Jaguar is because it has been years. Revealed as a design study at the Los Angeles auto show in 2016, the I-394, a likely competitor for the Tesla Model X, makes its production debut, and goes on sale, just before the show opens. Built in Austria on a dedicated aluminum-intensive chassis with a twin-motor 394-horsepower drive system, the I-Pace will have a range of 240 miles. But while crowds cluster around that shiny new object, savvy show visitors can be taking in the delicious XJ sedan, F-Type sports car and F-Pace S.U.V.,As the genuinely international brand of the Fiat Chrysler combine, Jeep continues to be a sales hit in markets well outside its American homeland. The Palexpo center will have samples of the Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Compass, and the new Wrangler.,The Italian sports car specialist rarely resists bringing some new variation of an existing model to a showcase like Geneva, but the main attraction will be the 641-horsepower Urus, which the company calls a super sport utility vehicle (a slippery slope in nomenclature, to be sure). The 190-mile-an-hour Urus will be prowling city streets, but probably very few mountain trails, later this year.,The days when a Range Rover represented the most elite of all S.U.V.s faded when the likes of Bentley and Lamborghini entered that market. So Land Rover will be showing a new model at the top of its line: the two-door Range Rover SV Coupe, to be built in a limited run of 999. The original Range Rover arrived as a two-door model, so this hyperluxurious new model, which seats four, will serve as a fitting tribute to the company’s tradition.,What was an upstart luxury brand from the utilitarian Toyota company three decades ago will soon have five utility vehicles in its portfolio. The latest is the UX crossover, arriving at the Geneva show as a dialed-back version of the UX concept unveiled in 2106 at the Paris show. The UX takes on the distinctive stance of recent Lexus sedans, notably the LC, and would logically share a platform used by Toyota’s C-HR and Prius. The Palexpo halls will also present the first European sightings of the new RX L and LF-1 Limitless concepts amid a display that includes the current LS, LC, RS and RX models.,The display for Maserati, which has a prominent entry in the luxury S.U.V. horse race, will be an important destination for many shoppers who want to consider the Levante. While there, the Ghibli, Quattroporte, GT and GTC will also be available to accept longing looks.,European shoppers will get the first look at the wagon version of the Mazda 6 and the Kai and Vision concepts. Also available for inspection will be the current range of Mazda 2, Mazda 3, CX-3, CX-5 and MX-5 models, and the Skyactiv-X engine that the company will be rolling out as practical proof that electricity isn’t the only answer to efficiency.,McLaren’s ranking in the universe of supercar builders takes another step up with the Senna, its most muscular road car, with a 789-horsepower twin-turbo V8. Named for ,, who drove to three championships for the McLaren Formula One team, this beast will run up to 211 miles an hour. Admirers can look over the car, but shoppers may want to avoid the heartbreak: The entire planned production of 500 cars has already been sold.,The flood of new models from Stuttgart in recent years shows no sign of abating, so anyone walking through the auto show displays will have lots to see. One sure to generate buzz is the AMG GT Coupe, a four-door version of the two-door sports car. A 4-liter turbo V8 will deliver 604 horsepower. The newest G-Class S.U.V., shown this year in Detroit, gets the AMG treatment with a 577-horse turbo-V8, but perhaps the most significant mainstream introduction will be a new A-Class hatchback. That will be in European showrooms this spring and eventually make its way to the United States.,Even to devoted fans of green vehicles, the news that Mitsubishi has sold 140,000 plug-in-hybrid versions of its Outlander crossover may come as a surprise; it’s been Europe’s best-selling plug-in hybrid for the past three years. The 2019 edition has more power, more choices of four-wheel-drive modes and greater battery capacity. On display, too, will be the e-Evolution concept vehicle, a futuristic (if squat) all-electric performance S.U.V. whose name might be a hint that it’s intended to fill the gap left by the death of the Lancer Evolution.,The PSA Group’s portfolio now adds the former General Motors subsidiaries of Opel and Vauxhall to the existing brands of Peugeot, Citroën and DS. With an updated Peugeot 508 hatchback and the new Rifter microvan, there’s plenty to see this year. The French automaker describes the 508 as “radical” and “reserved,” a combination that’s pretty hard to square, but whatever. The Rifter departs from the usual packing-crate motif with a more French interpretation of the utility van, communicating an intent to instill urban appeal. There is a four-wheel-drive version, naturally, though that is just a design concept for now.,Add Volvo to the list of automakers starting E.V. sub-brands as a way to ride the Tesla wave of popular acclaim. Polestar, an existing nameplate that Volvo has used for performance models, is using the Geneva show to go public with the Polestar 1, a 600-horsepower plug-in hybrid coupe. The understated four-seater promises more than 90 miles of all-electric range and will start production in 2019.,The push to be a something-for-everyone automaker continues to advance at Porsche. Visitors will find Panamera variants, including the not-a-station-wagon Sport Turismo, and a 462-horsepower plug-in hybrid, alongside the Boxster, Cayman, Cayenne and Macan. But center stage will be the 2019 911 GT3 RS, powered by a 4-liter nonturbo engine of 520 horsepower, the most powerful naturally aspirated engine ever fitted to a road-legal Porsche.,“Wait, did I get lost?” That’s what visitors who discover the hulking Ram 1500 pickup might wonder at Palexpo. FCA is not only flexing its truck muscle here. The 808-horse Dodge Demon will also be shown in this land of high-price gasoline.,By the time the Palexpo center opens to the public, a still-secret design study that Renault says is “focused on shared urban mobility” will have been unveiled. Likewise, much of the display will be devoted to upgrades of current models geared to city drivers. The Zoe, Europe’s top-selling E.V., gets a more powerful motor, and the Captur and Scenic models are upgraded with a new 1.3-liter engine developed with Daimler.,One of the most-anticipated cars at this year’s show is a touring coupe that’s intended to fill the gap left by the cancellation of the much-loved Supra in 2002. Developed jointly with BMW, the new car — on display in Geneva as a racecar proposal — is expected to also become the next edition of the BMW Z4. There’s more: Along with futuristic confections like the Concept-i and Concept i-Ride, Toyota will have the Aygo city car and Mirai fuel-cell model.,Sales setbacks resulting from VW’s diesel troubles are not keeping it from looking ahead to a product line dominated by electric power. Leading that effort to change public perception will be the I.D. Vizzion, the latest in a string of I.D. concepts. This all-electric sedan is aimed at the autonomous future — it has no steering wheel or pedals.,There’s no question about Volvo being on a roll, with enthusiastic receptions of its XC60 crossover and S90/V90 models. Beyond those favorites, Volvo adherents will be able to take in the sleek 2019 V60 wagon and XC40 crossover as well as the XC90 S.U.V. and V40 wagon.,Location: Palexpo Arena, ,, 1218 Grand-Saconnex, Geneva.,Open to the public: Thursday through March 18.,Hours: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.,Admission: Adults CHF 16 (about $17), children 6 to 16 and pensioners CHF 9.,Geneva International Motor Show website: ,.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 15, 962098)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,"Amid Optimism, Automakers Pack Geneva With What’s Next",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/automobiles/autoshow/geneva-auto-show-what-to-expect.html
"Mike Reid loves his cherry-red 2016 BMW 335i sports sedan, especially the way this 2016 model accelerates and zips around corners.,“It’s a fantastic car to drive,” said Mr. Reid, an investment manager and a part-time hockey player in Ann Arbor, Mich. “The pick up is incredible.”,But when BMW starts introducing a new generation of electric cars in the next year or so, Mr. Reid is not likely to be rushing out to the showroom. Although electric cars tend to have a lot of torque, he’s just not sold on the idea of plugging in and charging batteries.,“I wish there were something I could get excited about, but I kind of like the hydro-carbon-powered approach to my transportation,” he said.,He added that he often headed into the wilds of Michigan to hunt and hike, places where he would be unlikely to find a good way to charge the car. And he said his neighborhood tended to lose power during storms, which could sometimes complicate charging at home.,“I’m just not sold on the reliability of the technology at this point,” he said. “Gas prices are pretty low. My car gets good gas mileage. So electric vehicles? No, I’m not interested.”,That type of sentiment presents a big challenge for Europe’s luxury carmakers. Many automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche and Volvo, are scrambling to produce lines of electric, hybrid and plug-in models.,Some of this next wave will be on display at the Geneva auto show, which opens to the public on March 8.,Among the models will be the Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-powered crossover that is something of a cross between a hatchback and a coupe. Jaguar unveiled the production version of the I-Pace last week in Graz, Austria, in a bid to build buzz ahead of the Geneva show.,The car is packed with advanced safety and driver-assist technologies and features two electric motors — one to deliver power to the front wheels and one for the rear axle. Together they are rated at 394 horsepower. The car is expected to go 240 miles on a single battery charge, Jaguar said.,The small vehicle, with its short hood, is also a jarring break from the classic Jaguar look of a low, sleek roof line, long hood and rounded back. “It’s quite distinctive,” Ian Callum, Jaguar’s design director, said at the Graz event. “It’s quite different. It’s quite radical.”,The company is hoping the vehicle will appeal to upscale buyers who want to drive an upscale car that is also environmentally friendly. “It’s electric,” Mr. Callum said. “Guilt-free.”,Volvo is expected to use Geneva to show the V60 station wagon, a plug-in hybrid and one of the models it is adding as part of a plan to add full or partial electric power to every one of its models by 2019.,Volvo and its Chinese owner, Geely, are also developing a new brand of electric cars to be sold under the Polestar name. Details of the brand’s first model, the Polestar 1, will be released at the Geneva show.,Audi is expected to offer showgoers test drives of the E-tron all-electric S.U.V. that is due in showrooms this summer.,Those are only some of the electric models European carmakers have in the works. Daimler AG, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, is spending $11 billion to develop at least 10 new electric models, due on the road by 2022. Mercedes is expected to market them under the brand name EQ. BMW plans to introduce at least 12 electric models between now and 2025, including a self-driving car it is calling iNext. Before then, BMW plans to introduce improved versions of its i3 electric car and i8, an exotic sports car featuring a hybrid powertrain.,While the company will continue offering cars powered by gasoline engines for years to come, BMW expects electric cars and hybrids to make up 25 percent of its sales by 2025.,“At the core of our product offensive is a clear focus on electrification,” Bernhard Kuhnt, chief executive of BMW North America, said in January at the Detroit auto show.,For the last several years, Porsche has offered hybrid versions of its sports cars and high-powered S.U.V.s, but in 2019 it is expected to add the all-electric car Mission-e. To ease worries about recharging the car, Porsche has started to install charging stations at its 189 dealers and at other locations in the United States.,“What we are doing here is creating a new world for Porsche,” said Stefan Weckbach, Porsche’s head of battery electric vehicles.,Carmakers are developing all of these models despite the reluctance of many car buyers. In 2017, 104,487 battery-electric vehicles were sold in the United States, less than 1 percent of the total market; 89,992 plug-in hybrids were sold.,And manufacturers that have jumped in early have had a bumpy ride. BMW’s i3 has been a slow seller. Last year, BMW sold 6,276 i3s, fewer than the number of 3 Series sedans it typically sells in a single month.,But one word convinces them that they are on the right track: Tesla. It is constantly on the minds of European makers, who fret about losing to the upstart maker of battery-powered luxury cars. Tesla sold more than 100,000 vehicles worldwide last year, making it a serious player in the upper-priced levels of the auto industry.,The United States market is not the reason Europe’s automakers are racing ahead with electric technology, however. The European Union and China are tightening regulations that force automakers to cut tailpipe emissions. For years, many European manufacturers were counting on selling a heavy mix of diesel models to help them meet the stricter targets.,But Volkswagen’s diesel scandal — the company for years equipped diesel cars with software that cheated emissions testing — has chilled sales and the willingness of governments to accept more diesels. Several large German cities have been pushing to ban certain diesel vehicles from their streets, and a landmark court ruing last month cleared the way for them to do so.,Britain and France have said they intend to ban new diesel and gas cars by 2040. China has moved the same way on tailpipe emissions and is shaping regulations to increase sales of electric cars to combat the poor air quality in many of its congested megacities.,Dieter Zetsche, the chairman of Daimler, said it was unclear when the market for electric vehicles would take off, but he was certain it would.,“It’s like a bottle of ketchup,” he said in a conference call in January. “It will come.

"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — When the Olympics conclude and the assembled news media depart, the venues in the host city are not razed, the volunteers do not scatter and the appetite for more competition does not wane. Another major international sporting event is in the offing.,That is when I pack my bags and go.,On the evening of March 4, nearly 23 hours after I left my home, I arrived at my accommodations here, to cover my third consecutive Paralympics, the Olympics for athletes with impairments.,It is one of my favorite assignments, a refreshing break from covering the N.F.L.,Access need not be negotiated. The press attachés are helpful. One-on-one interviews are plentiful. And the athletes are gracious and obliging, eager to discuss more than just their performance — which, for my purposes, is critical.,The directive from my editors is at once specific and nebulous, but it can be distilled into this: Feel free to explore a range of subjects and trends — à la my , on how skiers who endured horrific collisions at the Sochi Paralympics in Russia four years ago conquered self-doubt and psychological anguish to compete in these Games — but don’t write traditional profiles of particular athletes, no matter how compelling their back stories may be.,The point is to focus on the athlete instead of his or her impairment. Paralympians might look different from Olympians in some cases, but that doesn’t mean they perceive themselves that way.,To me, it’s almost a journalistic disservice to highlight one athlete over another. How to choose whether to write about the Swiss champion skier paralyzed on one side of his body, the American sled hockey player whose leg was amputated a year after his Army vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Iraq, or the Australian snowboarder who lost parts of both arms after being attacked by two great white sharks?,And so in the months leading up to the Paralympics, I chat with United States coaches and athletes to brainstorm ideas, whether over the phone or on reporting trips — in November I spent time with sled hockey players in Madison, Wis., and wheelchair curlers outside Utica, N.Y. — so I can position myself well once I’m on the ground.,With venues scattered across a sprawling region; a vast network of buses that transport reporters among those event sites, their lodgings and the main broadcast and press centers; and news media descending from around the world, every Paralympics is nominally the same, and yet each offers its own array of trials.,Covering this Winter Paralympics (which run through March 18) feels more manageable — or rather, less daunting — than covering the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, where 22 sports were contested across four clusters of competition, versus six sports across two clusters in Pyeongchang. Nonetheless, I must plan days ahead, since it’s almost impossible to report on multiple events in one day. Also, I’m the only reporter in Pyeongchang from The Times.,Best I can tell, I’m the only one from a major American news outlet other than NBC, which broadcasts the Games across its platforms. The International Paralympic Committee says it credentialed 801 members of the news media, an increase of 132 from Sochi. More than a quarter of that total came from South Korea. At the same time, the number of accreditations from the U.S. decreased, from 57 to 33.,The Paralympic movement is gaining exposure and popularity, but the absence of the American press corps, which travel to basically every other huge international sporting festival, is jarring, and not having that camaraderie can feel isolating. Combine that with a time difference that makes it difficult to communicate with my editors, much less my family, and it’s easy to lapse into a funk. Then I think about the skier whooshing down the mountain without a left leg or a left arm, and my concerns feel quite small.,My experience here has been enhanced by working with our staff photographer Chang W. Lee, a native of South Korea who has taught me so much about Korean culture — and exposed me to such culinary delights as spicy catfish stew, and squid and pork belly bulgogi.,Inevitably, I do make connections with people, such as the helpful language services volunteer at the Gangneung Hockey Center, who, noticing me yawning in the late morning on Sunday, said he could empathize; he too had a long flight from the U.S., where he attends college. “Where?” I asked. “Emory,” he said.,That’s where , went. We laughed about the fortune of flying halfway across the world to chat about our freshman residence halls. I gave him a New York Times pin and waited for him and another volunteer to translate my questions for a Japanese sled hockey player first into Korean and then into Japanese. It wasn’t ideal, but that’s how life goes. It was a reminder that we’re all different but, really, all the same, too.",BEN SHPIGEL,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 16, 122080)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,The Loneliness of the American Paralympics Reporter,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/insider/the-loneliness-of-the-american-paralympics-reporter.html

Few American officials were so directly involved in that frenzy of abuse, which began under President George W. Bush and was ended by President Barack Obama, as Gina Haspel.,On Tuesday, in announcing that he had dismissed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and was replacing him with Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Pompeo’s successor would be his deputy, Ms. Haspel.,As an undercover C.I.A. officer, Ms. Haspel played ,” under which suspected militants were remanded to foreign governments and held at secret facilities, where they were tortured by agency personnel.,Ms. Haspel ran the first detention site in Thailand and oversaw the brutal interrogations of two detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Mr. Zubaydah was waterboarded at least 83 times in a single month; his C.I.A. torturers bashed his head into walls and subjected him to other unspeakable brutalities. This cruelty stopped when investigators decided he had nothing useful to tell them.,The sessions were videotaped and the recordings stored in a safe at the C.I.A. station in Thailand until they were ordered destroyed in 2005. And who did that? By then, Ms. Haspel was at C.I.A. headquarters, and while the agency said the decision to destroy evidence was made by her boss at the time, Jose Rodriguez, Ms. Haspel’s name was on the cable with the destruction orders.,In ,, these activities were of such concern that Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, blocked Ms. Haspel’s promotion to be head of the agency’s clandestine service. Since then the two have spent time together, leading Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday to describe Ms. Haspel as a “good deputy” and to say she would wait until the confirmation hearing to make a judgment on the appointment.,Senator John ,, Republican of Arizona and a former prisoner of war, insisted that during the confirmation process, Ms. Haspel must “explain the nature and extent of her involvement” in the interrogation program. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said her roles overseeing the waterboarding of detainees and the destruction of tapes were troubling. He and the American Civil Liberties Union called for Ms. Haspel’s ,as part of her nomination.,The use of torture and secret foreign prisons — think of the deeply disgraceful events at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq — was a boon to terrorist groups, helping their propaganda and recruitment efforts. Such activities were also an irritant to key allies and even put American forces and personnel at risk of legal liability and being subjected to harsh treatment when they are detained.,Ms. Haspel is reportedly respected by many C.I.A. officers. But she effectively ran an illegal program, and her promotion to such a top administration position, unless she forcefully renounces the use of torture during her confirmation hearing, would send an undeniable signal to the agency, and the country, that Mr. Trump is indifferent to this brutality, regardless of what Secretary Mattis believes.

"In late February, a large portion of the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole experienced an alarming string of extremely warm winter days, with the surface temperature exceeding 25 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.,These conditions capped nearly three months of unusually warm weather in a region that has seen temperatures rising over the past century as greenhouse gas concentrations (mostly carbon dioxide and methane) have increased in the atmosphere. At the same time, the extent of frozen seawater floating in the Arctic Ocean reached new lows in January and February in 40 years of satellite monitoring.,In recent years, the air at the Arctic Ocean surface during winter has warmed by over 5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. So was this recent spate of warm weather linked to longer-term climate change, or was it, well, just the weather?,What we can say is this: Weather patterns that generate extreme warm Arctic days are now occurring in combination with a warming climate, which makes extremes more likely and more severe. What’s more, these extreme temperatures have had a profound influence on sea ice, which has become thinner and smaller in extent, enabling ships to venture more often and deeper into the Arctic.,This sea ice loss, in turn, has created a feedback loop. Thinner, receding ice allows the ocean’s heat to escape more readily into the atmosphere, which the Arctic’s highly stable lower atmosphere traps near the surface during the polar night. As a result, winter surface air temperatures have warmed more in the Arctic compared with the global average.,This warming is posing major , and wildlife in the Arctic. Thinner sea ice is more mobile and deforms more easily from winds and currents. In February, southerly surface winds blew sea ice away from the northern shore of Greenland, causing the largest expanse of open ocean in winter , recorded by satellites. Similarly, the Bering Sea experienced extreme sea ice retreat this winter. With more open ocean, major wind storms generate large waves that cause damaging coastal erosion, endangering oceanside towns.,A warmer Arctic also means that Greenland’s land mass sheds its vast blanket of ice faster, currently at about 70 trillion gallons of water per year, which contributes to rising sea levels.,The extremely warm Arctic days occurred at about the same time as an atmospheric pattern known as sudden stratospheric warming dominated the Northern Hemisphere. During an S.S.W., the air temperature rapidly rises by at least 45 degrees Fahrenheit at altitudes above where transcontinental aircraft fly, at roughly 30,000 to 150,000 feet.,The S.S.W. in February caused a major disruption to the atmospheric jet stream of the Northern Hemisphere — the strong westerly winds that encircle the Arctic — by driving the jet stream to teeter and temporarily slow. Without westerly winds to transport weather from west to east, cold air streamed in over Europe and parts of North America from the northeast. As a result, , while the Arctic was extremely warm.,We don’t know yet whether the S.S.W. pattern drove warming in the Arctic this year and whether climate change influenced this weather pattern. But we do know from paleoclimate reconstructions that Arctic warming rates in the industrial era are happening faster than at any time in the past 12,000 years and that the Arctic’s sea ice decline is now greater than at any time in at least the past 1,450 years. Recent warming and ice loss are inevitably linked to climate change caused by human activity. But more research is needed to understand events this winter because the conditions were so unusual.,Both the S.S.W. and the Arctic warming , with outstanding accuracy in timing and magnitude about two weeks in advance, which allowed parts of Europe hit by the unusually frigid weather plenty of time to prepare. American scientists are now developing new computer models to improve forecasts so that they go beyond two weeks by taking into account ocean temperature, circulation and sea ice cover.,Preparing for future shifts in weather extremes also requires a better understanding of how the climate is changing. This will require long-term government investment in surface-based and satellite observations, and in the continued development of new computer models for improved predictions. Even as funding for climate change research has become highly politicized and is under threat, record numbers of talented students are applying at our universities to do graduate work in climate science. Given enough support, they could improve our future by helping us prepare for it.,The extreme Arctic warming this winter is a foreshadowing of things to come. On our current greenhouse emissions trajectories, the Arctic Ocean is expected to be ice-free in late summer by about midcentury or possibly as early as 2030, depending on natural variability. The impact will extend beyond the Arctic, adding to warming and sea level rise throughout the Northern Hemisphere.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 16, 404769)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Hot Times in the Arctic,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/temperature-climate-students.html

"Helen Rosario and Erdal Gerda didn’t venture far when they left Passaic, the historically industrial city in northern New Jersey where they grew up. In 2014, the couple bought a three-bedroom split-level on a quintessentially suburban street in Clifton, Passaic’s larger neighbor.,Though happy to be near family, Ms. Rosario, a tax accountant who is now 39, and Mr. Gerda, a 33-year-old programmer, saw practical reasons for choosing Clifton. There are multiple ways to commute to their jobs in Manhattan, some 15 miles away. There are national retailers and movie theaters along the Route 3 corridor — “a great place to do anything we need to do,” Ms. Rosario said. Significantly, similar houses in desirable Montclair were priced up to $100,000 higher than the $375,000 they paid across the border in the Montclair Heights section of Clifton.,“We’re near all those restaurants in Montclair,” Mr. Gerda said, “but we didn’t have to pay those Montclair prices and taxes.”,Clifton, in southern Passaic County, is an unpretentious, predominantly middle-class city of 85,000, crisscrossed by highways, two of which — the Garden State Parkway and Route 46 — intersect twice within its 11½ square miles. Framed on the west by a wooded mountain and on the east by the Passaic River, the city has pockets of both industry and agriculture (three tiny farms that survived the postwar development boom).,The population is as varied as the landscape. The personal finance website WalletHub this year ranked Clifton the 25th most culturally diverse city in the United States and No. 3 in linguistic diversity. The latter distinction jibes with local officials’ finding that more than 70 languages are spoken in the homes of public school students.,“There are a lot of little worlds, religiously, ethnically and locational-ly, that thrive in Clifton, yet they’re all happy to be part of the total picture,” said Ernest J. Scheidemann, a local real estate and insurance agent and lifelong resident. The spirit of acceptance was famously demonstrated three years ago when the Clifton High School senior class selected a Muslim student who wore a hijab as its best-dressed female student.,For residents, the ethnic diversity is a selling point, even if some were initially unaware of it. Jason Chuon, who bought a $380,000 expanded Cape Cod after being uprooted from Staten Island by Hurricane Sandy, said he was worried that his Asian-American family might stand out. That was not the case in a town with vibrant Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Asian and Eastern European communities.,“We have friends here who are Muslim, Hispanic, you name it,” said Mr. Chuon, a 38-year-old online marketer. “There’s a Colombian guy on one side of me, a Polish lady on the other. Everyone’s trying to just make a living and better themselves. I tell my friends and family in New York, ‘You’ve got to check out this place.’”,Wrapping like a horseshoe around Passaic, Clifton is adjacent to 10 other municipalities, including struggling Paterson, in Passaic County, and Montclair, Bloomfield and Nutley in Essex County. The city, which takes up five ZIP codes, is defined by its distinct neighborhoods, most with their own commercial districts, public elementary schools and parks. (Old-timers tend to say they’re from Athenia or Allwood or Botany Village rather than Clifton.),What is called downtown Clifton is Main Avenue. Along this low-rise thoroughfare stretching between the Paterson and Passaic borders are Peruvian restaurants, hookah stores, Turkish markets — even a pierogi maker.,Among the neighborhoods, Allwood is known for its district of Tudor-style homes; Albion, in the shadow of the Garret Mountain Reservation, has street after street of tidy Cape Cods; Clifton Center, which includes Main Avenue, abounds with older, multifamily colonials on narrow lots. The most expensive properties are in Montclair Heights and Rosemawr.,Condominiums and rentals are in ample supply. Cambridge Crossings, a 15-year-old gated townhouse community on a former industrial tract, has several hundred homes, some for ages 55 and older. Country Club Towers, next to the Upper Montclair Country Club, has 476 rental apartments in a pair of 1960s-era high-rises.,Clifton’s largest development project in years is in the early stages. A medical school affiliated with Seton Hall University and Hackensack Meridian Health is expected to begin operating later this year at the former headquarters of pharmaceutical giant Roche, once Clifton’s largest taxpayer. The 116-acre site on Route 3, partly in Nutley, is being reimagined as a life sciences campus consisting of the medical school and ancillary businesses, including a hotel. New construction is planned for the Clifton portion. “Five years from now, we hope to be talking about hundreds of new jobs,” Mayor James Anzaldi said.,“At the low-end, you can pick up a small one-family house in the $250,000 to $300,000 range in areas bordering Paterson and Passaic, and at the high end, you might find a million-dollar home in Montclair Heights,” said Nicholas Tselepis, broker-owner of the Nicholas Real Estate Agency in Clifton. Mr. Tselepis noted that Clifton’s accessibility and relative affordability appeal to buyers from New York City.,On Mar. 8, the , website showed 137 properties for sale, the majority of them single-family houses, with about 60 in the $300,000 to $400,000 range. A dozen listings were for $599,000 and up, with the most expensive a $1.19 million custom-built Cape with four bedrooms and four and a half baths, in Rosemawr.,From May 1, 2017, to Feb. 28, 2018, the median sale price for a single-family house was $336,000; for a condo or townhouse, $285,000; and for a two- to four-family house, $384,250, versus $308,000, $318,000 and $322,500 in the same period a year earlier, according to the Multiple Listing Service.,After the new federal tax law capped the property tax deduction at $10,000, a survey by the city found that about three-quarters of homeowners were already at or under the $10,000 threshold, Mr. Anzaldi said.,Residents of this suburban melting pot rally around their lone high school and its high-stepping ,. Traditions like the Fourth of July picnic and fireworks show and the raising of a sea of American flags on patriotic holidays on the municipal complex grounds also bring people together.,Then there are the hot dogs. Aficionados debate the merits of a pair of Clifton institutions that have been around a combined 147 years. , is known for its “rippers,” deep-fried dogs slathered with the roadside joint’s sweet mustard relish. At the Hot Grill, chili sauce-topped Texas weiners are the specialty.,Another gastronomic landmark is the Tick Tock Diner, open 24 hours and beckoning Route 3 passers-by to “eat heavy.”,Buses provide Clifton transit commuters the most direct way to Manhattan: From Route 3, it is a straight shot to the Lincoln Tunnel. From the Allwood Park & Ride, New Jersey Transit’s No. 192 bus gets to the Port Authority terminal in 35 minutes and costs $6 one way, or $167 monthly. Additionally, the private DeCamp Bus Lines serves Montclair Heights.,The city’s two rail stations are on New Jersey Transit’s Main Line. From the Clifton station in Athenia, the trip to Penn Station in Manhattan requires changing trains at Secaucus Junction and takes 45 minutes; the cost is $7.25 one way or $210 monthly. From the Delawanna station, it is five minutes shorter and costs $5.50 one way, or $170 monthly.,The Clifton district has 14 numbered grade schools, most enrolling 200 to 500 students. Christopher Columbus and Woodrow Wilson middle schools, each enrolling about 1,200, serve grades 6 to 8.,Clifton High School, on Colfax Avenue, is one of New Jersey’s largest public high schools, with 2,924 students. Mean SAT schools for 2016-17 were 516 in reading and writing and 519 in math, versus 551 and 552 statewide. Sixty-one percent of the class of 2017 went on to college, versus 71 percent statewide.,Voters of Acquackanonk township greenlighted incorporation as a city in 1917 and ditched the tongue-twisting Lenni Lenape name in favor of Clifton, a reference to a prominent local cliff.,Though a ways from Yankee Stadium, Clifton has Bronx Bomber connections. On April 29, 1923, Babe Ruth homered during an exhibition game against the semipro Doherty Silk Sox and had to be rescued from fans mobbing the field to congratulate him.,“The ball traveled so high that it almost became lost in the thick haze that hovered over the desert wastes of Clifton,” The Passaic Daily News rhapsodized.

"When the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb began his race in a special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, he faced headwinds of the type that caused horizontal snow in the nor’easter last week.,For starters, Donald Trump had won the district by 20 points in 2016. The district has been held by Republicans for most of the last 50 years. Conservative “super PACS” were willing to spend millions — it ended up being around $10 million — to buy TV time to savage Mr. Lamb.,The incumbent, Tim Murphy, a conservative anti-abortion Republican, had a lock on re-election until The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion. Republican House leaders decided that Mr. Murphy had to go. He resigned in October.,The man Republicans chose as their candidate was Rick Saccone, a Jurassic-era conservative who boasted that he was “Trump before Trump was Trump.”,That apparently was a few Trumps too many for voters in the 18th, which begins in the Pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way, in classic gerrymandering fashion, through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the West Virginia border.,It’s no wonder that Mr. Saccone entered the race as the favorite. This race was Mr. Saccone’s to lose — and darned if he didn’t.,Absentee ballots still must be counted but Mr. Lamb held a lead of ,, enough for him to declare victory early Wednesday. The news media was more cautious, but if the absentee ballots match the split of the vote at the polls, Mr. Lamb’s narrow lead will shrink, but hold.,The problem with political campaigns is that they don’t exist in theory but in fact. Factors like the candidate’s personality can carry weight, as does the effectiveness of his field effort and advertising. And, lest we forget, his position on the issues.,Mr. Saccone, 60, was a wet blanket of a candidate, without a scintilla of charisma. He also didn’t particularly care for campaigning, organized few public rallies and rarely took to the streets to speak with voters. He let the super PACS do the talking for him, with saturation TV ads.,While Mr. Saccone was a mediocre campaigner, Mr. Lamb was an excellent one.,He has a sterling all-American résumé: Marine, federal prosecutor, scion of a politically prominent Democratic family from Mount Lebanon. At 33, he had the stamina and the desire to knock on door after door. He stopped wearing a suit and tie on block visits after one resident yelled “You’re a Jehovah’s Witness!” at him. Mr. Lamb yelled right back, “I’m a Catholic!”,The race in the 18th morphed into a side-door referendum on Mr. Trump, and on Tuesday turnout was high in both red and blue portions of the district.,Mr. Lamb’s strongest showing was in Allegheny County, where suburban voters — including Republicans — provided him with votes. Mr. Saccone ran up his votes in the three outlying counties.,Ted Kopas, a Democrat who is a Westmoreland County commissioner, warned about finding national or even cosmic trends in analyzing Mr. Lamb’s victory.,“Before you get try to put too much theory into voters’ minds, I think all the credit should go to Conor Lamb,” Mr. Kopas said. “There is no substitute for a candidate who is willing to go everywhere and do anything. He is the kind of person who, when people meet him, they like him. Smart and articulate. He is the picture of what people want to see in a congressman.”,Voters also liked his politics. Last weekend, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers, reached deep into his bag of compound adjectives to declare at a Lamb rally: “He’s a God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending Democrat.”,The 18th has long been the anger zone of state politics, populated by contrarians known mostly for their dislikes: of social progressives, of abortion, of politicians from the east (read: Philadelphia), of anti-gun do-gooders — the list could go on.,With the demise of coal and steel and ancillary industries, we are witnessing the “revenge of the working class,” according to someone who should know.,David Levdansky was a state legislator from Allegheny County, a pro-union Democrat who served for 26 years until he was unseated by Mr. Saccone in 2010 by 151 votes. Two years later, in a rematch, Mr. Saccone won again — by 112 votes. The defeat still stings.,What the collapse of core industries did was create a cadre of voters who, as Mr. Levdansky said, mimicking these angry voters’ message: “We want change! Give us change! We want to punish the elected officials in office!”,To Mr. Levdansky, Mr. Saccone is a “charlatan” who specializes in feeding voters red-meat issues while supporting cuts in education and human services. In the Pennsylvania House, Mr. Saccone introduced one bill to require schools to emblazon “In God We Trust” on every building and another to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons without a permit.,Hillary Clinton did not stand a chance in the 18th, She was running against Mr. Anger himself.,President Trump stopped by the district for a rally on Saturday night at which he spent five minutes urging the crowd to support Mr. Saccone and 70 minutes talking about himself.,If Mr. Saccone prided himself on being a Trump clone, Mr. Lamb bears a striking resemblance to another successful Democratic Pennsylvania: Senator Bob Casey, who is also pro-union and anti-abortion, although Mr. Lamb takes the position that while he is personally opposed to abortion, the laws should not change. Mr. Casey’s brand of politics, and his nice-guy persona, work well in Pennsylvania.,When he first ran for the Senate in 2006, Mr. Casey won the 18th by 11 percentage points. It’s all the more impressive because the man he defeated was Rick Santorum (another angry man, come to think of it) who represented the district until he quit to run for the Senate.,In another era, Mr. Casey would be called a centrist. Now, he’s too conservative for progressives and too liberal for conservatives. The only people who like him are the voters.,Mr. Lamb does not meet the test of ideological purity sought by his party’s progressive wing, but the future of the party may rest upon Democrats like him, who have the insight to understand Mr. Trump’s appeal and act accordingly. Ivory Soap Democrats won’t cut it in territory like the 18th.,One additional note: whoever wins should take only a short-term lease on his district offices. After all this storm and fury — not to mention the millions spent — the 18th in its current form is likely to disappear. The state Supreme Court has redrawn all congressional district lines effective in the November election though Republicans have sued in federal court to overturn the redistricting.,In any case, if Mr. Lamb’s lead holds, to keep his seat he will have to run again in the fall for a full two-year term. And although the image is still a little blurry, the results of the latest political Rorschach test are in, and it doesn’t look good for Mr. Trump or his party.",,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 16, 526927)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,How a Democrat Succeeds in Trump Country,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/conor-lamb-how-a-democrat-succeeds-in-trump-country.html

"President Trump’s decision to block a foreign company’s ,, which makes chips for smartphones and other devices, before the deal had even been signed, was extraordinary. It was also the right move, given the series of mergers that has left the semiconductor industry already dominated by a few large companies.,Singapore-based Broadcom was trying to acquire Qualcomm, headquartered in San Diego, for $117 billion — which would have made it the largest technology deal in history — in a hostile takeover. Mr. Trump pre-emptively blocked the purchase on Monday, ,. While the president did not provide a detailed rationale, , calling for a review of the deal said that the administration was concerned about Broadcom’s relationships with other foreign companies.,The letter strongly hinted that those companies of interest are based in China. It also noted that Broadcom has reduced spending on research and development at the businesses it acquires, a practice that could make Qualcomm less innovative. That, in turn, would give Chinese businesses a leg up in the race to develop the technology for the next generation of cellphones, known as 5G, which is expected to provide faster internet access and generate billions of dollars in profits for the wireless industry in the coming years.,Seen against the backdrop of the president’s protectionist statements and policies, this decision is unnerving. He recently used another national security law to announce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, arguing that he was seeking to force China to reduce excess production of those metals. In reality those tariffs will not hurt China much, landing a , like the European Union, Brazil and South Korea and possibly starting a wider trade war as other countries retaliate against the United States.,That is why , that by blocking the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, Mr. Trump could further rattle the global economy and international norms. Other countries might now feel emboldened to block as a security threat inbound foreign investment that they consider significant, justifiably or not. France and other countries have a history of protecting companies they consider “national champions,” but the United States has been reluctant to do so. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is made up of representatives from across the executive branch, looks at acquisitions that could represent a national security problem, but its reviews typically end up scuttling only , annually, though the number has increased in recent years.,Because the committee does most of its work in secret, it is hard to know if it is making the right calls. But in this case, the ultimate outcome was correct because the potential takeover raised serious antitrust concerns.,There are good reasons to worry about the growing concentration of power — and lack of competition — in the semiconductor business, which supplies chips used in everything from phones and computers to cars and fighter jets. If the Broadcom-Qualcomm merger had gone through, just three companies — Samsung, Intel and Broadcom — would have controlled more than 36 percent of the global market for chips, ,. And the concentration would have been far greater in certain fields, like telecommunications.,As the number of players in the industry shrinks, innovation tends to decline because companies have less reason to worry about losing business to competitors. And they have a bigger incentive to milk profits by raising prices on existing products, which are often protected by patents that in the United States typically give inventors a 20-year monopoly over their creations. Such arguments would typically arise during antitrust reviews by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, but they are also important to national security. That’s because the government is heavily dependent on private companies like Qualcomm, which , by developing communications systems for the military.,Broadcom being based in Singapore provided the Trump administration an easy way to block this deal. But even if it had been an American company, this acquisition would have been a hard sell.",THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"[datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 15, 20, 30, 16, 618665)]",,,news,chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box,news,Trump Was Right to Block a Merger,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/trump-qualcomm-merger.html
"Dear Grandmother,,Good thinking! About a third of the top jobs in the Trump administration are ,, and while they usually aren’t the kind of things that go to 21-year-olds, most of the people who are actually qualified wouldn’t touch them with a 10-foot résumé.,Secretary of state seems to be off the table for the moment. But there’s definitely an opening for personal assistant to the president — that’s the guy with the pens. The previous incumbent, John McEntee, was escorted off the White House grounds this week after he failed his long-delayed security clearance — reportedly because of financial issues involving gambling and taxes.,There aren’t any specific job requirements, but McEntee did star in , in which he demonstrated his ability to knock a bottle off a friend’s head with a football. Can your grandson do that?,No problem! McEntee, 27, has already been hired as senior adviser for the Trump re-election campaign. This is an administration that believes in failing upward.,Dear Rick,,Hey, aren’t you the Republican who was running for Congress in that safe seat in Pennsylvania? I saw you at the end of the campaign, claiming Democrats hate God. Lots of luck.,Dear Z,,South Korea is a very sensitive post and you would be crazy to think you can qualify just because Trump hasn’t found a nominee in more than a year. Be realistic. How about ambassador to Ireland or Iceland or Belgium or Jordan or Bolivia?,Dear Brat,,Consider becoming White House communications director. The job is open and if you get appointed, you should definitely be out by June. The first guy disappeared before Trump was even inaugurated, in the midst of what would have been regarded, in a less lively administration, as a sex scandal.,And then there was Mike Dubke, who lasted three months, and Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted 10 days, and Hope Hicks, who quit when her boyfriend, the staff secretary, was accused of spousal abuse.,Well, there are a lot of forms to fill out, but first you should try to find a contact in the administration who can put in a good word for you.
