"When Sally Maughan steps into a large fenced area in her backyard here, eight orphan bear cubs pay her the ultimate compliment.,''They treat me like a bear,'' said Ms. Maughan, who can lumber about in pretty convincing fashion. ''When I come in the door, they're thinking that way. They'll take a swat at me. They'll grab my shirt sleeve like it's the scruff of another bear.'',And that is the whole point, for Ms. Maughan is doing all she can to get these bears back into the wild this spring. Idaho wildlife officials call her ''the bear lady,'' and for the last 10 years she has been the volunteer in charge of an unusual program intended to return orphaned cubs to the wilderness.,Left on their own after their mothers are killed, usually in an illegal hunt or sometimes by a passing truck on a remote highway, young bears will almost surely die, because they cannot forage or otherwise fend for themselves in the first months of life. Some are brought to Ms. Maughan so young that she has to bottle-feed them every two hours.,''She basically teaches them how to be bears,'' explained Kris Van Cleave, a spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.,So far, Ms. Maughan, a 52-year-old travel agent, has returned 37 black-bear cubs to wilderness areas across Idaho and in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, and wildlife officials in charge of the releases say follow-up observations and checks of radio tags indicate that nearly all have done just fine.,In perhaps the greatest testament to her success, only one of the bears has shown an inclination to wander back to areas of human habitation like campgrounds in search of food. (That bear was ultimately deemed a ''nuisance bear'' and sent away to a university research project.),''Sally's very good at what she does,'' said Jeff Rohlman, a regional wildlife manager for the Fish and Game Department. ''She's good at minimizing contact, at keeping the cubs somewhat leery of humans, and that's exactly what you want to do with these bears.'',For Ms. Maughan, the process is something of a conundrum, since even as she devotes so many hours to the cubs and develops an obvious affection for them, the last thing she would ever want to do is treat them like pets.,''That's not the point at all,'' she said. ''If you get too emotionally attached, you'll wind up defeating everything you're working towards. A bear wants to be free. A bear needs to be free.'',What she feels when watching the bears successfully scamper off into the wild is a bit akin to the intensely mixed emotions, the pride and the sadness, that many parents experience when their children head off to college.,In fact, ''bear cubs go through comparable stages of development to children,'' Ms. Maughan said, ''except that it happens over a period of months, not years.'',Until the age of 8 weeks or so, the cubs are bawling infants, in need of a lot of nurturing, closeness, security, food and sleep.,After that, ''they begin about a month of the terrible 2's,'' she said, when ''they need supervision, they throw their own version of temper tantrums, they want what they want when they want it.'',By about 6 months, the teen-age stage has arrived. ''They get a bit wild and reckless,'' she said. ''They don't use good judgment, and seem to feel invincible.'',And then, at last, as they near the point of their release, ''you can breathe a sigh of relief,'' Ms. Maughan said.,''Now it's almost like having a college student around,'' she said. ''They take an interest in their surroundings and start to investigate and really try to figure out what makes everything tick.'',Of course, she cannot be exactly sure of all those equivalents, she said with a laugh, since she herself never reared any children.,''I never wanted to have kids,'' said Ms. Maughan, who never married, either. ''I'm really not a people person. Let's just say I'm more of a bear person.'',Ms. Maughan lives in this Boise suburb with her 85-year-old mother, also named Sally, 18 cats (at last count), 2 coyotes (Pouncer, 10, and Sparkle, 8, who have successfully acted as foster parents to several orphaned pups in a program that returns coyotes to the wild as well) and a good 75 or so stray ducks.,''She's just been this way ever since she was a little girl,'' her mother said. ''She'd come home from school, and there'd be four or five dogs following her.'',In past years, Ms. Maughan has spent as much as $6,000 of her own money on the bears, which have a voracious appetite for a diet that includes dog food, fish, fruit (especially apples and frozen grapes), carrots, acorns, bees, wasps and, she said, ''an occasional mouse who tries to join the picnic.'',Ms. Maughan has never been injured by any of her bears. The closest she ever came was when one of the cubs, nicknamed Griz, grew agitated one day and gave her, well, a real bearhug. But he eventually let go, and she was fine.,Every orphaned bear that is rescued and makes it back to the wild is a bear that in the past would have either died in the wild or most likely been put to death if found by wildlife officials. While black bears are common in many states, and while the North American population is not considered to be endangered, animal experts say Ms. Maughan's work should be applied to bear species around the world that are. Her nonprofit foundation recently received a $6,000 grant from the World Society for the Protection of Animals, based in London.,''On a global basis, there's no one doing what she's doing as well as she's doing it,'' said Chris Morgan, a bear specialist with the society. ''There's a lot to learn from her.'',Tara Wertz, regional wildlife habitat biologist with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, who has brought cubs to Ms. Maughan, said: ''As far as we're concerned, she's a godsend. You know, there just aren't a lot of people out there you can call on to take in a bear.''",SAM HOWE VERHOVEK,"FEB. 23, 1999","For Orphaned Little Cubs, a Den Mother",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/us/for-orphaned-little-cubs-a-den-mother.html

"Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vowed yesterday to sue to recoup the disability payments paid to a former high school teacher who asserts that job-related injuries prevent him from working in the schools but not as a ski instructor in Vermont.,The teacher, Larry Feldstein, retired in 1994 from Humanities High School in Manhattan, where he had been a physical education teacher. He was granted a disability pension on the basis of injuries he said he received in April 1992 while demonstrating a hockey shot and removing locks from a gym locker, said Jonathan L. Kimmel, counsel to the Teachers' Retirement Board. Mr. Feldstein, 55, has been getting tax-free monthly payments of $3,299.70 since then, or about $172,000.,Mr. Kimmel said the board had been aware, through anonymous letters, of Mr. Feldstein's work at the Mount Snow ski resort since 1996 and took action to revoke his pension. The board's doctors, after re-examining him in an annual physical, upheld his claim then and did so every year until last September, when they declared him fit to work.,Mr. Feldstein, whose case was first reported yesterday in The Daily News, appealed their decision.

"THE Clinton Administration is pressing Madison Avenue to voluntarily adopt a code to insure that media outlets and agencies owned by members of minority groups get what is deemed their fair share of consideration when advertising dollars are spent -- or run the risk of Federal scrutiny.,The Administration's efforts, representing an intensification of interest from Washington in the issue, were outlined at a meeting yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in midtown Manhattan sponsored by the American Advertising Federation. The federation is a coalition that represents national agencies, advertisers and media companies as well as local advertising associations in 207 cities and student chapters at 248 colleges and universities.,Officials of the federation, based in Washington, are among the leaders searching for ways to increase diversity in an industry that still displays an overwhelmingly white face to the consuming public, even as the racial and ethnic backgrounds of the intended audiences for sales pitches grow more diverse.,The Administration has expressed a preference for the industry to adopt voluntary self-regulation, as has been its policy on policing Internet advertising. But if progress is judged to be lagging, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Justice may step in -- or Congress could pass legislation.,''The marketplace is growing with minority wealth, yet there's very little specifically directed to multicultural audiences,'' Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the federation, said in an interview.,''We're looking for opportunities to forge new understandings about the value of the minority market,'' he added, ''and how to reach it.'',The federation is reorganizing its board, Mr. Snyder said, to create a permanent standing task force dedicated to diversity and multicultural advertising. That group will be headed by Thomas J. Burrell, chairman of the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, and Edward R. Erhardt, vice president and publisher in New York of Advertising Age, owned by Crain Communications Inc.,The meeting comes a month after the Federal Communications Commission released a study concluding that advertising revenue per listener for radio stations with black and Spanish-speaking audiences -- many of them having black and Hispanic owners -- lagged behind revenue for mainstream stations, even in markets where the nonmajority stations drew higher ratings. But the study did not specify why that occurs; the commission has called for additional research on the matter.,That study was cited frequently at a colloquium on Jan. 18 sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton and several industry organizations, which was aimed at pressing Madison Avenue to devote more resources and attention to multicultural consumers and media.,''Diversity of voices and views is a pillar of our democracy,'' said Vice President Al Gore, who addressed the federation's meeting by satellite from Washington. ''That is why we must insure that our airwaves provide opportunity for all Americans and both reflect and respect the full diversity of the country they serve.'',Mr. Gore announced the formation of a Federal interagency working group to examine current advertising practices and their effect on media outlets and agencies owned by minorities. The task force will be composed of representatives of the Justice Department, the F.C.C., the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.,''It's a complex problem,'' William E. Kennard, chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview.,There is ''lots of powerful anecdotal evidence'' that some advertisers and agencies buying commercial time ''are operating on misinformed stereotypes and cruel judgments about minorities and what they buy,'' he added. ''And some advertisers are just not focusing on getting quality research to understand minority demographics.'',Still, Mr. Kennard said, ''the advertising industry has been very receptive'' to the initial attempts to address those issues, adding that ''we're starting to coalesce around some concrete next steps.'',One such step he identified would be the voluntary code of conduct to be followed in buying advertising time and space in the media.,The general principles that Mr. Kennard offered as a starting point for formulating a code included using accurate data to gauge consumer purchasing patterns, insuring fair access to information and promoting fair competition for advertising dollars ''among a wide range of media outlets.'',Mr. Snyder said he thought that self-regulation was far more preferable to Government intervention because ''it would be more efficiently handled, better done by the industry.'' The federation is one participant in the longtime industry self-regulatory processes for adjudicating disputes about advertisements and children's advertising, along with the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers.,Though the agency association also disdains Government regulation, that organization considers a code ''neither feasible nor helpful,'' according to a memo sent to members on Feb. 4 by O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive.,''The F.C.C. report is right on at least two points,'' the memo stated. ''Minority radio broadcasters are getting less revenue per listener and the issue needs more study to determine why.'',The dispute over ''advertiser and agency bias against the minority media has recently become a political issue,'' according to the memo, a copy of which was provided by the agency association, ''threatening to damage the reputation of the advertising industry in general and the media buying practices of advertising agencies in particular.'',''Thus far, the dialogue has been cordial and productive,'' the memo continued. ''However, it is important that advertising agency and media management put these matters high on their 'must solve' list'' -- along with clients, because ''progress on these issues must involve advertisers as well as their agency partners.''",STUART ELLIOTT,"FEB. 23, 1999",THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; White House presses to insure minority-owned agencies and media get a fair share of business.,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/business/media-business-advertising-white-house-presses-insure-minority-owned-agencies.html

"AS every Wall Street firm struggles to figure out how to play the Internet, an advantage may lie with those that, like a fresh recruit to a midnight poker game, have yet to put their chips on the table.,Unlike its chief rivals, Goldman, Sachs & Company has never been a retail brokerage firm, meaning that it does not have an army of brokers selling stock to the public. Only a year ago, Goldman was seen as lagging so far behind Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch in the lucrative retail business that it risked becoming a niche player in financial markets. The Internet could change all that.,Goldman is now actively studying ways to become a retail broker using the Internet, people close to the firm said. One way would be to work out a joint venture with an on-line brokerage firm, possibly FMR's Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, or E*Trade. Another way would be to create its own on-line brokerage offering.,But the people close to the firm dismissed as highly unlikely the possibility that Goldman would buy E*Trade or another publicly traded on-line leader, saying that sky-high stock market valuations of Internet companies rule out a purchase of that kind.,The strategy discussions are taking place as Goldman itself prepares to go public, reviving a plan that was shelved last September amid world financial market turmoil. Unless the United States stock market undergoes a serious correction, Goldman will likely issue shares as early as late April, people at Goldman said.,Going public and developing a strategy for the Internet are seen as separate but related activities, Goldman executives said. One said the firm intended to have a clear Internet strategy in place when it begins marketing shares to investors, especially given the intense enthusiasm displayed by investors for Internet-related stocks in recent weeks. Also, Goldman could use its stock as a currency to make acquisitions or enter alliances after going public.,''Investors are going to ask about the Internet,'' said one person familiar with Goldman's strategy discussions. ''You can't hem and haw and say you're thinking about it. They will want to know exactly what you're doing and you want to be able to tell them.'',Goldman is not the first Wall Street firm to take the Internet seriously. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber, three leading brokerage firms with big retail operations, have all offered some Internet services for their customers. But Goldman's situation is intriguing to many in the industry precisely because the firm does not have a major retail operation -- and can thus change its strategy and enter a new business without spending heavily to build up a traditional network of retail brokers.,In fact, several Goldman executives spoke with evident relish about the delicate task facing Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Those two rivals must balance the interests of their thousands of retail brokers, most of them paid through commissions earned when they trade stocks for their clients, with the growing promise of Internet trading that largely eliminates the role of the traditional broker. Goldman calls this a ''channel conflict,'' and says it provides firms without a significant number of retail brokers a chance to challenge established competitors.,''Warfare used to be who had the biggest infantry,'' said the person familiar with Goldman's strategy talks.''You had to feed and clothe those guys and they died for you on the front lines. Now you don't need to be in the infantry business at all. We have smart bombs.'',Leslie Tortora, Goldman's head of global technology, and Larry Buchalter, managing director in the firm's fixed-income division, are heading a new committee to study the matter. The committee met for the first time only a week ago and it seems unlikely to reach a recommendation immediately, people close to the situation said. The existence of the committee was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.,Goldman has already dipped its toes in Internet waters. It has reserved blocks of shares of companies it underwrites for distribution to retail investors through E*Trade, a leader among the dozens of existing on-line trading firms. Both Goldman and E*Trade are also partners in an electronic stock trading network called Archipelago.,E*Trade's share price rose $8.4375, or 20 percent, to $48.5625, in trading yesterday on speculation that it would seal a fresh alliance with Goldman.,But while people close to Goldman do not rule out new links to E*Trade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., they played down their relationship with the company. E*Trade has overemphasized ties with Goldman in news releases, one Goldman executive said. The executive said that such releases might have given the impression that Goldman had chosen E*Trade as its main on-line partner, an impression he said was inaccurate.,On the contrary, Goldman is still debating how best to deploy one of its potential on-line aces: its stock research. Goldman has talked with both Fidelity and Schwab as well as E*Trade about distributing Goldman research.",JOSEPH KAHN,"FEB. 23, 1999","THE MARKETS: Market Place; Goldman, Sachs is a latecomer to selling stocks on the Internet, which may end up an advantage.",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/business/markets-market-place-goldman-sachs-latecomer-selling-stocks-internet-which-may.html
"The dollar retreated from a three-month high against the yen yesterday on expectations that the rise in the dollar would slow after last week's 6 percent gain.,The dollar fell for the first time in six days against the yen to 121.10, from 121.35 Friday and after climbing as high as 122.53 yen in Asian trading. Its drop accelerated when it fell back to 121.50 yen, setting off automatic sell orders that took it as low as 120.05 yen. Such orders are placed to protect against losses if a currency moves contrary to expectations.,The dollar's yen losses were tempered in afternoon trading by a rally in United States stocks and as bonds gained.,In other trading, the euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar since the single currency's inception in January on expectations that slow growth in Europe would prompt the European Central Bank to reduce interest rates.,The euro fell to $1.1024, from $1.1069 Friday, dropping as low as $1.0962 earlier.

"LAST year's tax season was not a pretty one for Michael Grande. Oh, he faced no major hurdles, no unexpected penalties or audits; it's just that he ended up shelling out ''north of 20 grand.'' He had expected to pay about $18,000, but he is an active investor and had a good a year in the market.,Mr. Grande, who is single, makes upward of $100,000 a year in salary and bonuses; he contributes to his 401 (k) plan, now amounting to $100,000 spread among three mutual funds, and invests nearly $25,000 a year in stocks. So he has a substantial income that he has not offset with deductions. For example, he rents an apartment in Manhattan, so he can't claim a deduction on a mortgage.,''There's no way for me to take any more deductions,'' said Mr. Grande, 31, a senior underwriter at Fleet Bank in New York, expressing a view shared by many ambitious young professionals.,Ah, but there are routes to tax relief. Susan Feitelberg, a Manhattan financial adviser, says Mr. Grande -- and many younger people like him -- could take several steps toward long-term financial security while lowering their tax bills. The moves could be particularly important for Mr. Grande, because he has a lofty goal: He wants to retire at 50.,For starters, Ms. Feitelberg recommended that Mr. Grande open a Roth I.R.A. His contributions, although not tax-deductible,  could grow tax-free for many years and be withdrawn tax-free during retirement. Because he already contributes to his employer's retirement plan and his income is above $40,000, he is not eligible for a traditional, deductible I.R.A.,''The Roth I.R.A. is great,'' Ms. Feitelberg said. ''It allows people with higher incomes to put more away.'' Single people can contribute $2,000 to a Roth if their adjusted gross income is below $95,000, and smaller contributions are allowed with incomes of up to $110,000; for married taxpayers the limits are $150,000 to $160,000. ''And you don't have to make the mandatory distribution at the age of 70 1/2, as you do with the traditional,'' Ms. Feitelberg said.,There are other benefits, too. After the account has been open for five years, Mr. Grande could withdraw as much principal as he likes for any purpose, without penalty, making Roths much more flexible than traditional I.R.A.'s. In addition, there are special breaks for withdrawals put toward qualified education expenses and first-time home buying, though with a $10,000 lifetime cap.,Moreover, the failure to contribute $2,000 now could cost him a lot more by retirement, considering the tax-free growth of a Roth account. ''By your late 20's you want to be putting away 10 percent of your income toward retirement -- I can't stress that enough,'' she said. ''Say you're 30, and you start putting $2,000 a year into an I.R.A. and you do that until you're 65. If you get a 10 percent return, you'd have a total of $244,692. But if you start investing at 31, you only get $224,566 -- a loss of $20,126. If you wait five more years, it's an $86,000 loss.'' For Mr. Grande, an avid competitor in triathlons -- which involve swimming, cycling and running -- that's a lot of bicycles.,Ms. Feitelberg also suggests that he make the maximum contribution to his 401 (k) -- 15 percent of his salary, in his case. (He currently contributes 12 percent, and his company matches his contributions dollar for dollar.),''The key is participation and understanding the types of funds you can choose,'' she continued. ''So many people I talk to randomly pick percentages and lose a lot of potential money by not understanding the funds they're in. To me, this is the most overlooked area of financial and tax planning.,''Let's say Mike maxes his 401 (k)'' at the $10,000 allowed by law, she said. His real cost is $6,150, since he's in the 38.5 percent tax bracket, considering Federal, state and city taxes. Then the employer's contribution comes on top of that. ''That's pretty awesome,'' she said.,MR. GRANDE could also itemize deductions on his tax return, rather than take the standard deduction, which is $4,250 for single filers. If he itemized, Ms. Feitelberg said, he could claim ''about $10,500 in state and local taxes, $2,500 in charitable gifts, and $1,900 in miscellaneous deductions -- close to $15,000 in itemized deductions'' -- more than three times the standard deduction.,For the last seven years, Mr. Grande has sponsored a road race in Norwalk, Conn., in conjunction with the United Way. The project costs him about $250, but he has never claimed it as a charitable gift. Nor has he deducted his miscellaneous expenses -- unreimbursed employee expenses like business-related calls made at home, professional dues and publications or business gifts; tax preparation fees; investment software, and safety deposit box rental.,Finally, there is the delicate matter of buying a home. Mr. Grande now pays rent of $1,024 a month for an Upper East Side alcove studio, which he shares with his snowshoes and three bicycles. He's financially savvy enough to know the tax benefits of buying versus renting -- buyers can deduct real estate taxes and mortgage interest, whereas renters have no deductions -- but ''I'm not sure if it makes sense,'' he said. ''Should I buy a condo or co-op, or am I getting more appreciation from my investments?'',Buy, Ms. Feitelberg advised. ''Single New Yorkers are more likely to delay buying because of their circumstances rather than their cash,'' she said, breaking down those circumstances into career (''What if my job changes?''); companion (''What if I meet someone?'') and commitment fears (''Uh-oh, now I'm locked in.''),''Financially, your life is always changing, but there's only so much you can control,'' she said. ''In the city especially, real estate and the stock market often go hand in hand, and your investments in either will likely move in similar directions.'',If, for example, Mr. Grande put down $45,000 for a $225,000 apartment, he could save about $5,800 a year in taxes. (The downside is that he would have to sell some investments to come up with the down payment and would be liable for taxes on the resulting capital gains.),But there can be a big tax break later. If he buys the apartment and lives in it for two or more years, as a single person he could take appreciation of up to $250,000 tax free when he sells it.,Besides, Ms. Feitelberg said, buying an apartment can only enhance his quality of life. ''If he buys, he can get the tax break and a few hundred more square feet,'' she says. ''Mutual funds can't provide room for bikes and snowshoes.''",ABBY ELLIN,"FEB. 28, 1999","YOUR TAXES; Young and Single, and Wanting Some Tax Relief",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-young-and-single-and-wanting-some-tax-relief.html
"AROUND report card time, there is no anxiety in the Brooklyn household of Lincoln and Marlene Nixon. Their son, Khari, 7, always has high marks and is ranked in the top percentile in both reading and math.,But the Nixons do feel anxiety about the tax season, because of the usual bill from Uncle Sam; it averages roughly $1,000 a year, on top of the taxes withheld from their paychecks. The tax liability often makes it tough to save for their children's education. They would like to increase the monthly allotment for a fund they set up for their son's college education and to begin a similar fund for their daughter, Kamila, 4.,''We realize we have to do something now,'' said Mr. Nixon, a manager for an industrial company who came to this country from the Caribbean island of Dominica 20 years ago.,The Nixons recently bought a $300,000 brownstone in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, and they expect the deductions for mortgage interest and real estate taxes to reduce their tax bill this year. But home ownership has brought other expenses, so the Nixons remain worried about meeting their goals for college savings.,''We don't want our kids to have to struggle'' to get an education, said Marlene Nixon, a registered nurse who immigrated from Grenada 23 years ago, adding that she and her husband ''did not have a foundation much like a child who was born here, whose parents may have been born here, who inherited assets.'',The 1998 tax year offers new possibilities for families like the Nixons. They can contribute, for example, to the New York State college savings plan, which started last year. It lets them set aside $5,000, free of state taxes, in a tuition savings account administered by T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F.  When the money is eventually paid out for education, Federal taxes on the income are due at the student's rate, which generally will be lower than the parents'.,''This is one of the best ways to save, because you get a state tax break and deferral on the Federal,'' said Alfred G. Osbourne, a senior financial adviser for American Express. ''I recommend this to all my clients who live in New York State.'',The Nixons, whose annual income is $120,000, also qualify for an Education I.R.A., which allows joint filers with modified adjusted gross income of up to $150,000, phasing out at $160,000, to set aside $500 a year for each child under 18 for education bills. While the initial contribution is not deductible, distributions are tax-free if used for qualified education expenses, meaning that there is no tax on the income earned.,''They are not going to generate that much money, since you can only put away $500 a year,'' said David Roy Eaton, president of the Eaton Group, a financial and estate consulting firm in New York, who does not recommend this option to clients. ''I think it is ridiculous legislation,'' he said. ''For an American who wants to send their child to a very good school, it's an embarrassment.'',THE Nixons have heeded Mr. Eaton's advice, bypassing the Education I.R.A. Instead, they give $121 a month to their son through a Uniform Gift to Minors Account invested in the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund, which produced a 34.76 percent return last year. The first $700 of earnings is tax-free; the next $700 is taxed at the child's rate, and anything over that is taxed at the parents' rate. Once Khari reaches 14, everything will be taxed at his rate.,Mr. Osbourne recommends that families choosing this option select growth funds that do not pay much in dividends and capital gains but have ''strong growth potential,'' so that the bulk of the taxable income will come after the child reaches 14.,The Nixons are not saving enough to afford the expected $174,121 cost of tuition, room and board for a four-year education at a private institution in 2010, when Khari is expected to be in college. Costs at public college would average $81,000, Mr. Osbourne said. He advises that parents hoping to send their children to a private school begin saving $447 a month at birth -- or $210 a month for a public college. Judging from Khari's academic performance so far, ''he'll probably choose a private school,'' Mrs. Nixon said.,THE couple established Khari's college fund when he was 4, and they hope to start a fund for Kamilia before the end of the year. The Nixons, who are also paying $11,000 a year to send their two children to the private Cush Campus Schools in Brooklyn, say they know they will have to increase saving to provide for college.,But they are still ahead of most middle-class families, who generally do not start saving for college until their children are in high school --  much too late, according to Mr. Eaton.,''We don't have a lavish life style,'' Mr. Nixon said. ''We stick to the basics, if you look at what we are doing. My children will go to the best possible college to provide them with the best possible education'' -- he paused -- ''that we can afford.''",DAVID J.

"A SELF-EMPLOYED publicist,  Shari L. Goldstein began building her business in the spring of 1996, when the older of her two sons turned 6. ''I started in a corner nook in my former husband's law office,'' Ms. Goldstein said. ''But it's a busy place, so I eventually rented a small office in Huntington,''  N.Y., near her home in Jericho on Long Island. ''Through word of mouth, the business developed.'',Later Ms. Goldstein, 40, like a growing number of entrepreneurs and consultants, moved her office to her home, giving herself the full array of tax traps and opportunities faced by the self-employed. The move occurred last September, when she and her husband were negotiating an amicable divorce; they agreed that he would get the law practice and she would get their home.,She moved the business into the home office for both personal and financial reasons.,''My kids were starting more after-school programs, and I knew that I'd have to do a lot more running around,'' she said. ''Working at home gives me more flexibility and more time,'' she said, although she still works more than 40 hours a week. In addition, the move saved money by eliminating rental payments and created tax savings.,Unlike many other start-up businesses, Ms. Goldstein's has always turned at least a small annual profit. So she never had to deal with an Internal Revenue Service policy, called the ''hobby loss'' rule, that generally prevents people from deducting expenses in a business that is unprofitable for 3 out of 5 years. The I.R.S. often construes small money-losing businesses as hobbies, not commercial ventures.,A talkative, outgoing woman, Ms. Goldstein worked in advertising and public relations before having children. She had enjoyed the publicity business but wanted to strike out on her own.,Like many business owners, she outfitted her office with a computer, a printer, a fax machine and two phone lines. Under Section 179 of the tax code, she was able to deduct the entire cost of the equipment in 1997, the year she bought it -- rather than depreciate it and take the deductions over several years. (For 1998 returns, business equipment worth up to $18,500 can be deducted in the year it was bought.),But she missed out on another tax break for self-employed people by not setting up a Keogh tax-deferred retirement plan for herself.,''The business was just starting out, and there wasn't much money around,'' she said. Besides, she said, she was married at the time, and ''I didn't think that it was necessary.'',Ms. Goldstein, whose clients are professionals, authors and companies, including Arthur Murray International Inc. and Chiron Associates,  reported her business income and expenses on Schedule C of the joint tax return she filed with her husband.,The couple plan to file their final joint tax return in April. After that, Ms. Goldstein will file her own return.,''He's in a significantly higher tax bracket,'' she said. They are ''paying taxes at a rate of 40 percent, which kills me,'' she said. ''I'm looking forward to stopping that.'',As part of the divorce settlement, her former husband will pay her health insurance premiums until her alimony ends in the summer of 2000. At that point, as a self-employed entrepreneur, she will be able to deduct 60 percent of her premiums; by 2003, they will be fully deductible.,She expects her business, which she runs as a sole proprietorship, to earn $50,000 this year. Has she thought about incorporating the business? ''The amount that I would pay to incorporate would negate the tax benefits,'' she said. She figures that incorporating would cost her $2,000 a year in legal and accounting fees, plus the time needed to complete the extra filings for taxes and the Department of Labor.,Having dealt with the tax consequences of divorce and self-employment, in August she faced another major event with tax implications. Shortly before she moved her office into her home, she received a phone call from her uncle. Her mother, who had moved to Florida when she was widowed three years earlier, had been killed in a car accident in a small town in Mississippi while returning from her new boyfriend's Army reunion. And so Ms. Goldstein took on a new role: executor of her mother's estate.,''First, I had to find out what and where everything was,'' she said. She and her brother flew to Florida. ''My aunt found a file, but then we had to play detective. Then we found a list of assets, neatly written out and updated every six months. My father had started tracking their investments and mutual funds in 1985. My brother and I sat down with three massive boxes and sorted everything into piles.'',THE next day, the stock market dropped during the late-summer selloff. As executor, Ms. Goldstein chose to value the estate as of the day after death. The I.R.S. also permits executors to value an estate as of six months after the date of death.,To the surprise of Ms. Goldstein and her brother, their parents had saved a considerable amount of money. The estate was worth more than $800,000.,Her windfall comes with its own tax consequences. Starting this year, Ms. Goldstein will owe a tax on distributions made by the individual retirement accounts she inherited from her parents. But, in a sense, her business is coming to the rescue. To minimize the taxes she pays, she has decided to start that Keogh plan for her business income.",CAROLE GOULD,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR TAXES; Pitfalls and Benefits In the Home Office,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-pitfalls-and-benefits-in-the-home-office.html
"AH, retirement, and early retirement at that. Trips to Hawaii and Mexico. Lazy days restoring a sailboat.,These are some of the activities of Ken and Marilyn Rocky of Little Silver, N.J., who are now planning to travel to England, having just returned from Puerto Vallarta. They have started on a life of travel and a pursuit of their own interests -- and are loving it.,''In the back of my brain, I always figured that I would retire at 59,'' Mr. Rocky said. ''My definition of failure was to be still working at 60.'',By that definition, the Rockys are super successes. Mr. Rocky retired a year ago at age 55 from his job as a district manager for AT&T. Mrs. Rocky, who is the same age as her husband, runs her own business as a management consultant but has plenty of time to travel with her husband. They have no children.,Mr. Rocky took advantage of a company buyout; he took a lump-sum pension payment and rolled it over into an individual retirement account. He also got other goodies, like a year's salary. In addition, the Rockys have Mrs. Rocky's earnings, and the stock market has been relatively good to them.,On the advice of their accountant, Doug Stives of Curchin & Company in Red Bank, N.J., the Rockys have made some financial moves and are planning others to keep their taxes in retirement as low as possible. Tax laws affecting retirees were already complicated, and with new provisions in effect for 1998 returns, the situation is even more complex.,One of Mr. Stives's admonitions involves what assets to use for everyday living. ''The strong advice I try to give retirees is: Don't plan on living on those types of assets that are tax-deferred until after-tax assets have been exhausted'' -- especially for someone like Mr. Rocky, who is not yet 59 1/2 and could thus face a 10 percent early-withdrawal penalty, Mr. Stives said. Early retirees can arrange a penalty-free withdrawal from a retirement account before 59 1/2, but complex rules require a minimum five-year payout to avoid a 10 percent penalty.,The tax-deferred assets include I.R.A.'s and what are known as qualified plans -- that is, pension plans, 401(k)'s, Keogh plans and similar retirement plans. For the Rockys, Mr. Stives advises living on Mrs. Rocky's earnings and the money in their nondeferred savings and stock portfolio before withdrawing any money from the I.R.A.,The reason -- beyond any penalties -- is that when money is withdrawn from a tax-deferred account, taxes are due on the full amount as ordinary income. This can be taxed as high as 39.6 percent, although most taxpayers are in lower brackets. But for securities sold outside a tax-deferred plan, the tax rate on any capital gain is just 20 percent; in the 15 percent tax bracket, capital gains are taxable at only 10 percent.,''Rather than take money out of your pension plan, I'd argue it's better to sell off some of your Microsoft,'' Mr. Stives said. By law, an individual must start taking money out of qualified plans at age 70 1/2. Mr. Rocky is 15 years away from that. With careful planning, he could end up with four or five times what he now has in his I.R.A., Mr. Stives said.,The Rockys, of course, could run out of assets to finance their carefree retirement, but one help, Mr. Stives said, will be Social Security, which Mr. Rocky can start tapping at age 62. The Rockys may decide to defer  Social Security beyond age 62 to increase their monthly benefits. But part of their Social Security benefits will be taxable, subject to the amount of their other income.,At some point, the Rockys could sell their house and pocket a capital gain on it of any amount up to $500,000 without paying a cent in tax. Of course, they would have to buy or rent another place to live, perhaps a condominium or something smaller than their suburban home.,AS for the I.R.A. money, Mr. Stives hopes the Rockys will roll some of it over into a Roth account. This may be heresy to some, since Roth accounts are seen by many advisers as primarily for younger investors. Converting an I.R.A. into a Roth account makes one liable for taxes on the money converted -- but then it lets the account holder or a beneficiary withdraw the money tax-free, no matter how much it has grown. The fact that a retiree must find the money to pay the one-time tax bill gives people pause, especially because a provision that allows taxpayers to spread the tax bite over four years ended last Dec. 31.,People with adjusted gross incomes below $100,000 can take any chunk of I.R.A. money and roll it over into a Roth. The Rockys expect a gross income of $50,000 to $60,000 from Mrs. Rocky's earnings, their investment income and other sources. With deductions and exemptions, their taxable income may be about $25,000, putting them in the 15 percent tax bracket. They could have about $18,000 more in taxable income before being bumped up into the 28 percent bracket. Mr. Stives recommends that they fill up the 15 percent bracket by rolling over $18,000 of I.R.A. funds into a Roth I.R.A.,Unlike the funds in an ordinary I.R.A., the money in a Roth never has to be withdrawn. Roth money can be left to a spouse and children, and it continues to be free of income taxes.,Can other workers in their 50's do what the Rockys are doing? ''It is not always feasible,'' Mr. Stives said. ''We have a number of clients who come in and say they have accumulated a million bucks with equity in their house and stock winnings, and they think they can retire.,''They think that if they can get 7 percent on their money, they can live quite well,'' he added. ''They neglect to consider that equity in their house is not income-producing.'' He points out to them that they may live 40 or 50 years more and could use up their assets quickly. Retirees often don't realize that their spending may well increase after retirement, and that medical expenses can eat up life savings at the worst possible time.,''They are also forgetting inflation,'' he said. ''I can guarantee we'll see it one day again.,''The typical person is in some cases in a dream world because he made 30 percent on his stock portfolio, but you can't depend on that continuing,'' Mr. Stives added.,At the other extreme are people who avoid any investment risk and make 3 percent or so on their money. Mr. Stives favors a happy medium.,As for the Rockys, Mr. Stives said he thought they could make retirement work. If worse comes to worst, Mr. Rocky can always take another job. Indeed, he worked one day as a consultant, but that seems to have fulfilled his need for employment. ''Get over it,'' he told himself.",DANIEL F.

"KEEPING records of stock purchases and sales and completing the tax forms to report capital gains and losses are tricky enough for the average investor. But for day traders, who spend their days flipping stocks, and for a growing army of other investors who trade often, lured by the bull market and the ease of trading on line, compliance with tax reporting rules creates a mountain of paperwork.,Just ask John D. Rankin of Osprey, Fla., who spends 20 hours a week managing his portfolio. He figures he makes 150 to 300 trades annually.,''It's a tremendous task to put together all those capital gains,'' said Mr. Rankin, who, in addition to managing his investments, is working with his wife, Bobbie Walck, to refurbish a motor yacht that sleeps six.,He has even considered paring back his portfolio, which averages roughly 200 stocks, to alleviate the pain. Paying taxes is not the problem; he figures that is the price of successful investing. Rather, the headaches come from sorting through the folders and spreadsheets he keeps to document his stock trades.,''It becomes painful to compile all that information, and you just want to walk away from it,'' he said.,Mr. Rankin, 49, began investing in the stock market when he was 21. His initial stake: money that he earned selling newspapers and shares of Laclede Gas that his father had given him when he was 6 years old. After graduating from the University of Missouri with a bachelor's degree in business and public administration, he worked in his father's company, which distributes industrial products to the wholesale plumbing and drilling trades.,At the same time, he refined his trading technique by talking stocks with stockbroker friends over drinks after work. ''You look at P/E's and pricing, and you begin to learn,'' Mr. Rankin said. ''As you go through periods of good and bad investing, you ask yourself, how can I do better next time?'',BEFORE he turned 30, he took much more investing risk than he is willing to take today. ''Now I'm looking for ways to protect myself by looking at asset allocation, reviewing the fundamentals on particular issues and balancing sectors,'' he said.,He trades on line using Street Smart, an investing program from Charles Schwab & Company that lets him update stock prices daily and provides price charts and data like individual stocks' dividends and price-to-earnings ratios. The program also tracks his price per share, and calculates gross and net gains.,Mr. Rankin said he made about half his trades on the Internet, after using Yahoo to search for information on companies and their stocks.  ''The Internet lets me access information in a timely fashion,'' he said, adding, ''It's hard for individual investors to get economic access -- or even any access -- to information from Goldman, Sachs and other big brokers.'',He has accounts with three brokers: Schwab, Olde Discount Brokers and Stifel Nicolaus & Company, a full-service broker in St. Louis, where he lived until his brother bought him out of the family business in 1997. Stifel manages part of his holdings for a fee, and he also trades independently at the firm.,Stifel prepares a running monthly compilation of his short-term and long-term transactions, ''which helps me manage my capital gains,'' he said.,Dealing with three brokers means  triple record-keeping. ''I maintain a book of account for each brokerage account and files for each company that I trade with,'' he said. ''Every trade that I do is deposited in the files and then entered manually into my computer.'',At year-end, the paperwork multiplies. Stifel prepares separate capital gains schedules for each money manager with whom Mr. Rankin worked -- there were four in 1998. And Mr. Rankin maintains both taxable and tax-deferred accounts with some of the managers, which complicates the paperwork.,All his Schwab trades are automatically recorded by Street Smart; he manually enters his Olde transactions into that program, too. Then he checks data from Stifel and Street Smart against his own records. When he ascertains that everything is correct, Mr. Rankin, who prepares his own return using Turbotax, enters all sales on Schedule D.,After that, he does what any good taxpayer would do.

"TAXPAYERS who rely on accountants or E-file their returns are invited to skip this article and proceed directly to ''Getting the Most Out of Your Tax-Related Gloating.'' This article is for those of us who still do our returns using nothing but a pen, our own brainpower and maybe some correction fluid.,The Internal Revenue Service hates us, because penmanship in this country isn't what it used to be and because the processing of millions of smudgy tax returns is cumbersome. So eager is the I.R.S. to have us file by computer that its World Wide Web site (www.irs.ustreas.gov) provides links to private companies offering electronic filing services.,Only about a quarter of all tax returns will be electronically filed this year, but it seems like a lot more, thanks to the Irritating Techno-Bragging Phenomenon, which infects nearly everyone who masters some new bit of technology. The Wright Brothers didn't brag as much as some people who have just managed to file a 1040 from a laptop. Louis Pasteur didn't brag as much.,If I seem bitter, it's because my kind and I are under siege.,''This is a kind of landmark time in the sense that the breadth of public awareness on tax filing and the breadth of public acceptance of Internet commerce have come together,'' said Randy Tullos, chief executive of the Securetax.com Web site of Universal Tax Systems, where people can file on line for a modest fee. Two years ago, when Securetax was new, the company filed 7,000 returns; this year, the figure is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands.,The I.R.S. has said that by 2007, it ''wants to do business electronically with 80 percent of U.S. taxpayers.'' Of course, it cannot order us to file by computer, though one can imagine subtle pressures. (''We notice, Mr. Genzlinger, that you had a bit of correction fluid on your 1984 Schedule A. Are you aware of the penalties for altering Federal documents?''),Yet thinking people don't rush into things. So I have compiled this objective analysis, weighing pen and paper against E-filing in crucial areas:,ACCURACY -- The I.R.S. and filing services love to trumpet the mistakes we hand-filers make. Electronic filing uses the computer for calculations, and most programs raise caution flags if you have forgotten a form or tried to depreciate your spouse.,But accuracy may be overrated. Peter Crabb, a psychology professor at Pennsylvania State University in Abington, has thought a lot about the skills we humans are losing to technology. Mathematics tops his list.,''Simple mathematical skills are just going right out the window,'' he said. Having a tax program do our addition only encourages this. Our returns may be more accurate, but we're getting lazier. And if we can no longer do the math ourselves, he asked, ''how are we going to understand if we're getting ripped off?'',And accuracy works both ways. A teen-ager in Dunkirk, N.Y., was once expecting a refund of $23. Instead, he received $555,555. If you E-filers want to pass up your chance at $555,555, that's fine by me; it just improves the odds for the rest of us.,Advantage: Paper.,SECURITY -- People in the E-tax business are extremely concerned about keeping criminals and precocious 11-year-olds from hacking into your tax return. Thus, E-filers may be asked to use secret numbers, passwords, decoder rings or backward writing that has to be read with a mirror.,But this ignores a broader danger, which I call the Kite in a Box Effect. Try this test: In a large box, place one 20-foot-long rope, one extension cord and one kite with string. Store the box in your garage for five years. Open. Rope, cord and kite string will be hopelessly tangled together, even though no one has touched the box.,Electronic communications are like that box. We've got telephones,  pagers and a few zillion other things all sending out electronic signals. Sooner or later, tangling will occur. Do I want my ''income or (loss) from tax-shelter farm activities'' marching across someone's beeper?,Advantage: Paper.,SPEED -- All right, for crying out loud, you get your refund in days, not weeks, if you E-file. Big deal.,Advantage: E-filing.,PHYSICAL SAFETY -- In 25 years of doing my taxes by hand, I have never been seriously injured. By contrast, the Web site of the Consumer Product Safety Commission contains recent recall notices for seven computer products and 11 surge protectors. These notices use phrases like ''fire, shock and electrocution hazards.'' Given the already natural pairing of ''death and taxes,'' it seems like an accident waiting to happen.,Advantage: Paper.,PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS -- Clearly, we humans are in danger of being downsized right out of the tax equation. We can already file electronically. The I.R.S. already offers to deposit your refund directly into your bank account. Turbotax and the others can already jump-start your return for next year, by grafting information onto it from this year's. It's not much of a leap to having your employer, bank and other institutions send their forms directly into the I.R.S. computer, which would fill out your return automatically and make the appropriate deposit or withdrawal from your bank account. The tax system would become a perpetual-motion machine; the taxpayer would be expendable.,Mr. Tullos of Securetax is not worried. ''That is potentially where it can go,'' he said, ''but where I differ from a lot of people is the pace at which I think it's going to go there.'',For one thing, he said, public resistance would be too great -- people would balk at giving up all control.,Professor Crabb would resist. Tax time, he says, is a chance for personal stock-taking. ''When you do your taxes, if you do them by hand, you get a mental model of what your income is and where it goes,'' he said. So the less automated, the better.,More cosmically, he's worried that we too readily turn our lives over to experts and technologies. ''It's just this chain of trust that we enter into, and we're helpless,'' he said.,Advantage: Paper.,COUNTERINTUITIVE CONCLUSION -- Despite the clear superiority of paper, I'm trying E-filing this year. Why? Because the I.R.S. says it will contribute to the public good, and we Luddites are nothing if not patriotic.,My biggest fear, though, is that when I get to the last E-page, where you tell the computer to send the documents on their way, that final on-screen box will say, ''Submit.'',My likely response: ''Never!''",NEIL GENZLINGER,"FEB. 28, 1999","YOUR TAXES; One Luddite Down, but Swinging All the Way",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-one-luddite-down-but-swinging-all-the-way.html
"A NUMBER of tax breaks come into play with the 1998 returns that Americans are now preparing, including child and education credits and new Roth I.R.A.'s. But they come at a price: new paperwork.,Still, when a tax return is approached step by step, most of the work is not too difficult. There are essentially two sets of numbers: income and deductions. Overlook any income -- say, reinvested mutual fund dividends -- and the Internal Revenue Service will demand its due. Neglect to take any deductions to which you are entitled, and you won't hear a peep; you'll just pay too much.,To help taxpayers understand the tax process, Jan M. Rosen of The New York Times used Macintax to prepare this return for a hypothetical two-income family, the Taxpayers, and wrote the accompanying commentary. The package was double-checked by tax professionals at Intuit Inc., which publishes the program and its sister program for Windows, Turbotax.,The most daunting aspect of this return is Form 8606, which was needed because an individual retirement account was converted to a new Roth I.R.A. Edward A. Slott, a certified public accountant in Rockville Centre, N.Y., and publisher of Ed Slott's I.R.A. Advisor, a newsletter, offered advice on that portion of the return.,Filling Out the 1040,The heart of a tax return, Form 1040 shows all income, adjustments to income and deductions, mostly as bottom-line figures brought forward from attached schedules and forms. Once all those forms have been completed, taxable income and tax liability, along with any refund or payment due, are calculated on the back of the 1040. Using a computer program, like Macintax, with extensive on-screen reference materials, or an on-line program is much easier than filling out forms by hand. Users answer questions in an on-screen inter-view, and the program puts the answers in all the right places on the forms and makes the calculations.,Like most married couples, the Taxpayers -- Samuel and Felicity -- are filing jointly (Line 2). They are en-titled to five exemptions (Line 6) -- two for themselves and one each for their daughter, Heidi; their son, Cyril, and Samuel's father, Sydney, whom they support.,Their income comes from several sources. Felicity and Samuel both had wages, she as a teacher and he as an insurance executive. The numbers from their W-2 forms are totaled on Line 7. Interest income (Line 8) and dividend income (Line 9) come from Schedule B. The Taxpayers received no state tax refund last year, but people who did must generally report on Line 10 any amount of the refund that was included in itemized deductions on their 1997 returns. Felicity quit her teaching job after the spring term and opened a music studio in the fall, giving individual and group lessons. Because of her first-year expenses, she had a loss (Line 12) that is calculated on Schedule C. Capital gains (Line 13) come from Schedule D.,When Samuel changed jobs a few years ago, he had his pension money rolled over into an I.R.A.; he has also made nondeductible I.R.A. contributions. The Tax-payers converted $50,000 of their I.R.A. money into a Roth I.R.A. but decided that was too much and put $10,000 of it back into a regular I.R.A. That is why their total I.R.A. distributions are $60,000 (Line 15a).,The Taxpayers took advantage of an opportunity available only in 1998 -- to spread the tax burden of their I.R.A. conversion over four years; thus $9,600 is taxable (Line 15b). They could make the Roth conver-sion because their adjusted gross income without it would have been below $100,000, the limit for eligibility.,Total income (Line 22) is $121,903, but Samuel had to pay alimony of $15,000 (Line 31a) to his first wife, and that brings the couple's adjusted gross income down to $106,903. The ex-wife's Social Security number must be shown (Line 31a). Alimony is taxable to recipients.,After deductions of $18,799 (Line 36 and Schedule A) and five personal exemptions worth $13,500 (Line 38), the Taxpayers have taxable income of $74,604 (Line 39).,Their tax of $15,309 (Line 40) is cut to $14,326 (Line 49) by a $560 credit for child and dependent care (Line 41 and Form 2441), a $400 child credit (Line 43), which is calculated on a new work sheet (not shown) and a $23 credit (Line 46) for foreign taxes. They own some Brit-ish stocks, and Britain withholds taxes on dividends. Because the amount is small, the Taxpayers do not have to file Form 1116. A household employment tax of $306 (Line 55 and Schedule H) for Heidi's sitter brings their total tax to $14,632 (Line 55). Because $13,700 was with-held from their pay (Line 57), the Taxpayers owe $932 (Line 68). That's good planning. People who get a refund have given Uncle Sam an interest-free loan.,Schedule A: Itemized Deductions,Like most other people, the Taxpayers cannot deduct medical expenses (Line 4), which are deductible only to the extent that unreimbursed outlays exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income ($8,018 for them, on Line 3).,They can deduct state and local income taxes of $3,569 (Line 5), real estate taxes of $4,800 (Line 6), home mort-gage interest of $8,200 (Line 10) and gifts to charity of $2,230 (Line 18). If audited, filers must be able to show a receipt from a charity for any single gift of $250 or more. The $430 (Line 16) is for old clothing and toys donated to a church rummage sale, and it is based on prices at the sale, not on the original cost.,Mortgage interest on a first and second home is generally deductible, as is interest on home equity loans of up to $100,000. Points may be de-ducted up front when buying or improving a house but in a refinancing must be amor-tized over the life of the loan.,The Taxpayers could not take a miscellaneous itemized deduction (Line 26), which is allowed only to the extent that outlays for such things as union or professional dues and unreimbursed business expenses exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income ($2,138 on Line 25).,Their itemized deductions total $18,799 (Line 28). Total deductions may be pared for joint filers whose adjusted gross incomes exceed $124,500.,Schedule B: Interest and Dividends,Banks, brokers, mutual funds and other payers of in-terest and dividends, includ-ing reinvested dividends, must send a Form 1099 to both recipients and the I.R.S., which can then identify people who do not report the income.,In the interest section, (Line 1) $650 is from municipal bonds. It is listed and then subtracted out as tax-exempt, leaving taxable interest of $1,550 (Line 4). Dividends total $2,090 (Line 6). It is no longer necessary to list mutual fund capital gains distributions or nontaxable distributions on this form. Capital gains distributions are now listed on Schedule D; there is no place to show the nontaxable distributions. The questions on foreign accounts (Lines 7 and 8) must be answered.,Schedule C: Profit or Loss From Business,Most self-employed people like Felicity Taxpayer, who started a business in 1998 (box checked on Line H), must file Schedule C, as must company directors or people with sideline work who earned income on which no taxes were withheld. Other forms are used for incorporated businesses and partnerships.,Business income (the I.R.S. means revenue) of $21,100 (Line 7) was more than offset by expenses of $27,700 (Line 28), resulting in a net loss of $6,600 (Line 31). Felicity's expenses included $15,000 for musical instruments (Line 13). Up to $18,500 of equip-ment and other items may be deducted at once, instead of depreciating the purchases over several years.,Felicity paid rent of $6,000 (Line 20b) for a studio in a shopping center, avoiding the home-office deduction that the I.R.S. tends to scrutinize.,Because her business is not yet profitable, she does not have to pay self-employment tax (Schedule SE) and cannot contribute to a Keogh plan -- and thus has no deductions for self-employment tax or Keogh contributions on Form 1040.,Form 8606: Nondeductible I.R.A.'s,The Taxpayers, who con-verted some of their I.R.A. money into a new Roth I.R.A. (Line 14a), must file this form. They also switched -- or recharacterized -- $10,000 of it (Line 14b) back into a regular I.R.A.,Mr. Slott, the Long Island accountant, warned that anyone who tries to fill the form in by hand may make a mistake because Line 8 says, Add lines 6 and 7. But buried on page 5 of an eight-page manual for the form is the further instruction to in-clude Line 14c in the calcu-lations. People using Mac-intax or Turbotax have it easier: They simply copy the numbers from the Forms 1099-R they receive into the program's work sheets; the program fills in the forms.,Taxes must be paid on any money converted to a Roth I.R.A. from deductible I.R.A.'s. When people also have nondeductible I.R.A.'s, the law treats the conversion as coming proportionally from both; in this case $38,400 (Line 16) of their final $40,000 conversion (Line 14c) is taxable. One-fourth of it, or $9,600 (Line 17), is taxable this year.,Form 2441: Child and Dependent Care Expenses,Working people like the Taxpayers -- or those looking for work -- whose adjusted gross income exceeds $28,000 can claim a credit of up to $480 for one dependent and up to $960 for two or more. (Credits reduce taxes dollar for dollar.) The Social Security or employer identification numbers of care providers must be shown.,Employer-sponsored dependent care assistance programs can be even more valuable. Samuel shielded $2,000 of his income from taxes through such a program for Heidi's care. (That benefit is reported on page 2, not shown.) In the Taxpayers' 28 percent bracket, that is equal to taxable income of $2,778. But they put aside only enough for Heidi's sitter, then unexpectedly had to spend $7,500 for Samuel's father, Sydney, who had Alzheimer's.,But no more than $4,800 for two or more dependents can be used in figuring the credit. For the Taxpayers that was limited to $2,800 (Line 6) because of the dependent care account, so they can claim a credit of $560 (Line 9).,Schedule H: Household Employment Taxes,People who employ household help like baby sit-ters, maids or gardeners must file Schedule H to pay what has become known as the nanny tax. They must also have a Federal employer identification number, entered at the upper right of Schedule H.,The Taxpayers employed Daphne Purr to care for Heidi after school. She earned $2,000, so they had to pay Social Security tax of $248 (Line 2) and Medicare tax of $58 (Line 4). Because her wages did not exceed $1,000 in any one quarter, they were not liable for Federal unem-ployment tax. The total tax of $306 (Line 8) is brought for-ward to Line 55 of Form 1040. Many people pay cash to household help and do not report it, but that is illegal.,The $2,000 paid to Ms. Purr came from the pretax money in Samuel's dependent care assistance account. A similar pretax account is available through many employers for medical expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance. Employees choose how much of their salaries to put aside in the accounts.,Schedule D: Capital Gains And Losses,After the confusion caused by the three capital gains holding periods created by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Congress reversed itself in 1998 and brought the number back down to two. Short term is a year or less, and gains are taxed at ordinary income rates. Long term is more than a year, and gains on securities are taxable at a maximum rate of 20 percent.,The Taxpayers sold four stocks and had a capital gains distribution from a mutual fund (Line 13). Two sales resulted in a net short-term capital gain of $3,338 (Line 7). The other two sales and the mutual fund distribution, which by law is considered long term, resulted in a net long-term gain of $925 (Line 16). Altogether, they had a net gain of $4,263 (Line 17).,On Part IV of Schedule D their income tax liability of $15,309 before credits (Line 54) is calculated. For those who have a net loss, up to $3,000 can be taken against ordinary income, and any excess can be carried forward to future years.,Looking Ahead,A tax return is a road map of a family's personal finances. So before filing away the finished copies for 1998, it is a good idea to study them to see what financial changes may be in order for the current year.,For example, assuming that Felicity's business becomes profitable, she may want to open a Keogh tax-deferred retirement plan. The couple may also want to consider putting an additional $2,000 apiece into Roth I.R.A.'s this year, if their income is below the $160,000 phase-out limit. Retirement distributions from a Roth will generally be tax-free.,With two children, the Tax-payers may also consider setting up new Education I.R.A.'s, although some financial advisers consider them to be much ado about very little -- a maximum of $500 a child can be contrib-uted annually.,Another way to save for education while saving on state taxes is through the qualified state tuition programs that many states are adopting, but parents and grandparents will want to evaluate such a move from an investment, as well as a tax, standpoint.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR TAXES; Mastering The Form 1040: A Step-by-Step Guide,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-mastering-the-form-1040-a-step-by-step-guide.html
"FOR the better part of two decades, the Federal budget deficit imposed tight limits on debates over tax policy. Republicans could not indulge their political and ideological desire to return more money to the people. Democrats were forced to support tax increases to maintain spending for the social programs they championed.,Now, with the advent of large and growing budget surpluses, the terms of the debate are being rewritten. No longer shackled by the demands of austerity, Republicans are pressing for a big tax cut this year, although they remain divided over the form and the size. The Clinton Administration is trying to thwart the Republican plan by demanding that Social Security and Medicare get first dibs on the surplus.,While the political fight this year and probably into the 2000 elections will center on that shorthand -- tax cuts versus saving Social Security -- there is also a growing focus on another, older and more fundamental issue. Should tax policy focus simply on raising the revenue needed to pay for the activities of Government? Or can the tax code be used as an effective instrument to address the nation's social and economic ills?,President Clinton is emerging as a determined advocate of the engineering approach, proposing to use tax law in myriad narrowly focused ways to help specific groups and encourage particular goals.,Because the rules that govern the Federal budget process make it all but impossible to create new spending programs, politicians are becoming increasingly creative in using tax credits and other breaks to direct money toward what they see as compelling problems. In the budget he sent to Congress this month, Mr. Clinton could not propose spending $5 billion to help families with the costs of long-term health care or $3.7 billion to help communities replace or modernize crumbling schools. But under the budget rules, he was able to allocate those amounts to those needs through tax credits. And these are just a few of dozens of examples.,''For the last few years, the dominant view has been one that regards the income tax system as if it were chicken soup -- a magic elixir to address any of the nation's social and economic problems,'' said Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School and a former Treasury Department official. ''Mr. Clinton's budget is only the most recent example. It seems to be becoming more and more extreme all the time.'',Republicans object to most of Mr. Clinton's proposals. And many of them advocate either streamlining the income tax system or replacing it with a new approach, perhaps a tax on consumption. They would wipe out the numerous so-called targeted provisions that critics say make the current tax code horrifically complex and inefficient. But for all their talk of driving a stake through the heart of the Internal Revenue Service, most Republicans in the end go along with the practice of loading up the tax code with provisions intended not just to raise money but also to reward specific companies, industries, groups or people.,''The pendulum seems to have swung about as far as it's ever gone in terms of these little tweaks and twists and doodads intended to reach targeted objectives,'' said Gregory F. Jenner, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Washington.,The Clinton Administration and most Congressional Democrats object to across-the-board reductions in income tax rates, contending that they benefit the wealthy disproportionately. They say that targeted tax breaks insure that help goes to those who need it most, and that they can enact a modest package of such cuts this year without having to spend any of the surplus.,Two examples of the approach they favor are the earned income tax credit for the working poor, which was expanded in 1993, and the tax credit for lower-  and middle-income families with children that was instituted in 1997. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said that these moves have given a family of four with half the median income the lowest income and payroll tax burden in 31 years.,But critics say the targeted approach has long since gotten out of hand.,The more the tax code deals with additional social and economic issues, the further it moves from the notion that people with equal incomes should pay equal taxes. Moreover, each new tax break creates more complexity; the child credit that many people will be able to claim for the first time during this filing season required a new work sheet and, for families with three or more children, a new form, and has proved to be a headache for many taxpayers, despite the ultimate reward of up to $400 a child on 1998 tax returns.,''They are exponentially increasing complexity, particularly for the middle class, which up until recently had not been the beneficiaries of these targeted initiatives,'' Mr. Jenner said.,IN pushing for an across-the-board income tax rate reduction of 10 percent or more, Republican leaders say they want to provide relief for all taxpayers, not just a chosen few, and to do so in the simplest possible way.,''Taxpayers won't be denied a tax cut simply because they don't behave the way the Government thinks they should or don't fall into a certain Government-prescribed category,'' said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and a Presidential hopeful.,Mr. Kasich, who derided the White House's targeted approach as being for ''left-handed cab drivers in New York,'' said reducing each of the five income tax rates by 10 percent would mean that ''taxpayers will not have to fill out new forms or decipher complicated instructions to get their tax cut.'',But not all Republicans agree, and Mr. Kasich signaled last week that he might have to scale back his plan to win support for it within the party.,Senate Republicans want to phase in any tax cut more slowly than Mr. Kasich has proposed. Moderate Republicans in the House prefer a package of cuts aimed at the middle class because they do not want to be accused by the Democrats of giving most of the benefits to the wealthy.,The moderates are rallying around an alternative plan that would provide narrowly drawn tax reductions -- largely for the middle class -- including scaling back the so-called marriage penalty, which leaves many couples in which both spouses work and have fairly similar incomes with a higher tax bill than that of two single people with the same incomes.,The moderates also want further increases in the amount of money retirees can earn before Social Security benefits become taxable. And they favor steps to restrict the impact of the alternative minimum tax on people who claim the new child and education credits.,Mr. Clinton's plan includes a variety of poll-tested tax proposals to deal with health care, child care, education, the environment and other issues.,They include a proposed $1,000 credit to help offset the costs of long-term health care, tax credits for employers who set up literacy and basic education programs in the workplace, an elimination of the 60-month limit on the deductibility of student loan interest, an increase in the credit for child care expenses and an expansion of a tax credit for the purchase of fuel-efficient and low-emission vehicles.,The White House strategy over the last few years has been to propose as many initiatives as it can stuff into its budget and then negotiate hard to force the Republican Congress to include a few of them in the final tax and spending laws passed at the end of the session.,The surplus could provide enough wiggle room to accommodate both parties, up to a point. But it remains unclear, in the aftermath of impeachment and with the 2000 election looming, whether either side wants a deal. The early signs are that this year could be one in which both sides make their arguments for what fiscal policy should look like at the dawn of the 21st century, and then let the voters decide.",RICHARD W. STEVENSON,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR TAXES; How Far To Swing The Ax?,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-how-far-to-swing-the-ax.html
"ON Sept. 15, 1990, her 35th birthday, Frankie Garrett got the type of present that most people would not wish on their worst enemies.,Representatives of the Internal Revenue Service knocked on the front door of her home in Tallahassee, Fla., she said, telling her that she and her husband, Claude Cash, owed money. At first, Ms. Garrett thought someone was playing a birthday prank on her.,That morning, she stopped off to see her husband at the construction site where he was working. She said he told her not to worry -- that he would take care of things. But her nightmare had just begun.,A month later, Ms. Garrett said, she was told by I.R.S. agents in Tallahassee that she and her husband owed the Federal Government about $20,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties and interest because her husband, who was self-employed, failed to file quarterly tax returns between 1986 and 1989. Ms. Garrett, a switchboard operator for the Florida Department of Education, recalls being ''livid.'' She had not known that the quarterly returns were mandatory in their situation, she said.,She said she gave Mr. Cash six months to straighten things out with the I.R.S. and, after he did not, decided to leave him. The divorce came through about a year after the I.R.S. first came calling, but the agency has since continued to collect money from her -- toward the balance owed from the years of her marriage, as well as for interest penalties that continue to accrue.,Mr. Cash, who still lives in Tallahassee, did not return several calls seeking comment on his own dealings with the I.R.S. A spokeswoman for the agency said that confidentiality laws prevented it from commenting on his situation or any other individual case.,Ms. Garrett is one of thousands of people -- nearly all of them women -- who may find themselves dealing with payment demands from the I.R.S. even though they believe they were not responsible for any underpayment. When a couple have filed a joint return, as most married couples do, the agency can go to either husband or wife for the money.,In I.R.S. parlance, people like Ms. Garrett may fall under the category of ''innocent spouses.'' But until recently, proving that an individual was truly innocent -- that he or she had no knowledge of the violations of the tax laws and did not benefit from the money kept from the Government -- was virtually impossible, said Jay Freireich, a tax lawyer in Florham Park, N.J., who specializes in innocent-spouse issues.,A new law that took effect in July, however, makes innocent-spouse status easier to claim. It gives the I.R.S. the burden of proving that a claimant was aware of tax problems and broadens the definition of an innocent spouse.,Since April, when the I.R.S. began centralized tracking of these cases,  about 10,000 people have filed for innocent-spouse status, said Maria Hwang, a program manager for the assistant I.R.S. commissioner of examination.,''The stories these women tell are hair-raising,'' said Beth Cockrell, a stockbroker in New York, who by publicizing her own situation brought attention to the plight of innocent spouses and worked to get the 66-year-old law changed. Now, through a group she formed called Women for Income Financial Equity, Ms. Cockrell keeps track of people like Ms. Garrett, steering them toward lawyers and accountants who are familiar with the issue.,MS. GARRETT said that like many women who let their husbands handle the finances, she never paid close attention to the couple's tax returns, although she signed them.,She said that she has managed to whittle the unpaid balance down to $9,000, but that all of her annual tax refunds have gone toward the bill. She said the I.R.S. also auctioned off several acres of land on which she had planned to build a house for herself and her two daughters. She now lives in a small house owned by a member of her family. Several years ago, she said, the I.R.S. also tried to dock her pay, but gave up after realizing that her salary barely covered her expenses.,Frustration led Ms. Garrett to appeal to Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. He was already interested in the innocent-spouse issue and, along with former Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, sponsored the legislation that President Clinton signed July 22. Last April 15, Ms. Garrett appeared with Mr. Graham in Tallahassee to talk about a need for changes in the innocent-spouse law, a spokesman for the Senator said. Now that the new law is in place, Ms. Garrett plans to seek innocent-spouse status.,''The rules have softened now, so I think she has a much better shot,'' said Shawne Blair, Ms. Garrett's sister, a certified public accountant in Boca Raton, Fla. In the past, Ms. Blair dissuaded her sister from seeking innocent-spouse status, thinking she would not qualify.,Even under the new law, Ms. Garrett would be unlikely to recover the bulk of the money she has had to pay, though she probably would not be held responsible for the remaining balance and could get refunds of her payments in the last two years.,Since 1990, Ms. Garrett has dealt with I.R.S. officials in Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Atlanta. She has kept a notebook -- three inches thick now -- that documents the contacts.,''I've been fighting this battle for nearly nine years and it's been a total headache,'' she said. ''But I'm not a quitter, and I feel as if I've been mistreated and stomped on. Thankfully, it looks like I'm getting to the end of the road.''",MICHELLE LEDER,"FEB. 28, 1999","YOUR TAXES; For Better, for Worse at the I.R.S.",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-for-better-for-worse-at-the-irs.html
"MOST home-and-garden shows have a fairly predictable assortment of vendors hawking a fairly standard assortment of windows, doors, wall-coverings, bath fixtures and kitchen appliances. But they also provide a showcase for newer products that are not yet widely familiar. .,Among the products at last weekend's 20th Annual Builders' Home Show in Kingston, Pa., near Wilkes-Barre, were an innovative gutter design, a siding system designed to be to houses what custom-made clothing is to people and a framing -- or rather molding -- system for poured-concrete structures.,''The Gutter That Never Clogs . . . Guaranteed!'' was a tag line guaranteed to catch the eye of any homeowner who has spent the better part of an afternoon perched on a ladder scraping soggy leaves out of a clogged rain gutter. ''If a Leafguard gutter clogs, we'll clean it for you,'' said Jim Palushock, office manager for F & L Gutter Systems in Hazelton, Pa.,Mr. Palushock's company is a distributor of the Leafguard gutter system, a replacement gutter manufactured by Englert Leafguard in Perth Amboy, N.J. The Leafguard gutter, he explained, never has to be cleaned because it is designed to prevent the buildup of debris.,Steve Bradley, operations manager for Englert Leafguard, explained that with an ordinary gutter, the top is either left wide open -- thus acting as a catch basin for leaves -- or it is covered with an add-on screen that must be cleaned periodically so that accumulated debris does not block water from flowing into the gutter.,But the Leafguard gutter has a built-in sloping hood that extends beyond the roof's edge and over the gutter channel, keeping solid objects out of the gutter. And rather than just end at the far edge of the gutter the hood instead curls down and in -- like a breaking wave -- so that the lip of the hood ends up positioned over the gutter channel.,When water and debris coming down the roof get to the hood, Mr. Bradley explained, the debris falls off at the curve while the water -- obeying the principle of molecuar adhesion -- sticks to the hood surface just long enough for it to reverse course and get in over the gutter where gravity then gets the upper hand and causes the water to drip down into the gutter.,(This is similar to what happens when you try to slowly pour liquid out of a container that is filled to the brim. It's virtually impossible to prevent at least some of the liquid from running down the side of the container and dripping off the bottom.),The Leafguard system, Mr. Bradley explained, is a not an ''add-on'' for an existing gutter, but a replacement cut and formed ''on-site'' to the exact size necessary.,And while it is more expensive than an ordinary gutter, costing from $8 to $13 a foot to install, depending on location and complexity of the installation, he said, all LeafGuard systems come with a lifetime warranty against clogs. (Additional information can be obtained by calling (800) 638-2507.),Another ''made-on-location'' exhibit at the Kingston show was sponsored by ABC Seamless of the Poconos, a roofing and siding company in Pocono Summit, Pa. ''We bring the factory to your house,'' said William T. Winkler, president of the company, which is a franchisee of ABC Seamless, a siding manufacturer in Fargo, N.D.,Mr. Winkler pointed out that while much of the siding material installed today is made of vinyl or aluminum, the siding he installs is made of hot-dipped galvanized steel coated with polyvinyl chloride -- commonly known as PVC -- to provide protection against the elements while allowing for expansion and contraction without cracking. Moreover, ABC Seamless siding is ''custom-tailored'' to fit each house.,Standard aluminum and vinyl siding material, Mr. Winkler explained, comes in lengths of about 12 1/2 feet. Whenever the area to be covered is larger than that, he said, separate pieces of siding must be used. And that results in visible seams where the individual sections overlap.,Seamless siding, on the other hand, comes on a roll, and can be measured, formed and cut to the exact size needed by installers working from a specially equipped truck  parked outside the client's house.  And since the siding material can be cut to any length of up to 150 feet long, overlaps are unnecessary and unsightly seams are eliminated.,''Our cost is generally 15 to 20 percent higher than the cost of vinyl,'' Mr. Winkler said, adding that ABC Seamless carries a lifetime warranty on the material itself and a 20-year warranty against defects in installation. Additional information may be obtained by calling (800) 732-6577.,Another intriguing product on exhibit at the show was ECO-Block -- a product that provides a new way of building houses from concrete.,''ECO-Block provides a labor-saving, energy-efficient method of building with concrete,'' said Bill Cotton, the owner of Cotton's Concrete Foundations and Forms, a construction company based Athens, Pa.,With the ECO-Block system, Mr. Cotton said, a house starts out as a hollow-walled shell made of expanded polystyrene foam. The shell is constructed with 2 1/2-inch-thick rectangular panels -- each about 4 feet wide and 16 inches high -- fastened into topless, bottomless, open-ended ''blocks'' by using special connectors that create a 4-  to 12-inch-wide space between the facing panels.,The blocks are then assembled to form the hollow-walled shell and, after openings for windows and doors have been cut out of the walls and fitted with frames, the shell becomes a mold, or form, for the exterior walls of the finished structure.,''You just pour in the concrete,'' Mr. Cotton said. ''It's actually easier than building with wood.'',James Dorr, northeast region manager for ECO-Block, the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company that manufactures the product (its Web site is www.eco-block.com), said that using polystyrene foam as the form for the concrete had several advantages.,First, he said, unlike plywood -- the form material most commonly used in concrete construction -- Eco-Block does not have to be removed after the concrete has cured. Instead, Mr. Dorr said, the 2 1/2-inch-thick foam serves as insulation on both the inner and outer surface of the exterior walls, thereby cutting heating and cooling costs and eliminating the need for additional insulation in the exterior walls.,And, he said, since Eco-Blocks have built-in nailing strips every eight inches, it is possible to fasten virtually any standard finish material to the interior and exterior walls -- including sheetrock, paneling, siding, brickface or stucco. Moreover, he said, electrical conduits and plumbing can be routed through the interior face of the exterior walls -- without having to drill holes through scores of framing studs -- simply by using a router or ''hot knife'' to carve a channel in the polystyrene. And perimeter support for interior floors, he said, is easily created by imbedding galvanized ''joist hangers'' in the concrete walls.,Construction costs vary from area to area, Mr. Dorr said, but the cost of building a concrete house using the Eco-Block system typically runs only 1 to 2 percent more than conventional construction methods.,''And when you're surrounded by six inches of concrete and five inches of foam,'' he said, ''you just wouldn't believe how quiet a house can be.''",JAY ROMANO,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR HOME; Products That Make Life Easier,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/your-home-products-that-make-life-easier.html
"SEAN NUTLEY, a Manhattanite who organizes parties for Wipe magazine and for Cesar Galindo, a designer, thought he had found his personal Shangri-La in the Hudson River Valley. Every weekend for the last two years, Mr. Nutley has shed the leather pants and orange Jean Paul Gaultier shirts he favors in the city and has put on Levi's and a sweater to tend his garden at a second home in Stone Ridge, N.Y.,Then one Saturday night, he was having dinner at the Bear Cafe, a streamside restaurant with a big fireplace -- very Woodstock, the town just up the road. In walked Donovan Leitch, the lower Manhattan scene-maker, along with Kirsty Hume, Amber Valletta and other supermodels, all puffing fiercely on cigarettes. They stuck out like a Fendi clutch bag at the farmers' market.,''It's social pollution!'' Mr. Nutley exclaimed, recalling the night last fall that he first realized his upstate hideaway might be changing, and not for the better in his view. ''I deal with models and stylists every day, and I'd rather just leave them in the city,'' he said.,The maple-covered hillsides, cornfields and rural byways of Ulster County, on the west side of the Hudson about 100 miles north of New York, have long attracted weekenders from the city, mainly those who pride themselves on wanting nothing to do with the social fish bowl of the Hamptons.,But recently a flashier crowd has been arriving, bringing new tastes and status symbols that do not always sit right with more low-key residents. Range Rovers have become an expected rather than a rare sight. Falafel stands, taco shops and jazz bars have opened. ''I've noticed women wearing lipstick, heels and lots of black,'' Mr. Nutley said. ''That's a definite danger sign.'',Mr. Leitch, who has posed with Kate Moss for Calvin Klein and sings with his band, Nancy Boy, at fashion parties, and Ms. Hume, his wife, a Victoria's Secret model, gave up their city digs to relocate full time in Woodstock. They are the latest in a wave of weekenders and transplants from the worlds of fashion and style to buy property in the area. Others include Angela Lindvall, a model; Camilla Nickerson, a senior fashion editor at Vogue; Alexis Borges, a booker at Next models, and Henri Kessler, a  club owner turned film producer.,Kevin West, who chronicles the fashion fabulous for Women's Wear Daily and W magazine, said, ''Upstate New York is now the place where the bellwether of the pack goes.'' He recalled a cocktail party in the Hamptons last summer at which Ulster County was a hot topic. ''It's cheap right now to buy a farmhouse, and the trickle has begun,'' he said. ''In two years, it will be a flood.'',Stone Ridge Liquors changed its name to Stone Ridge Wine and Spirits under a new owner and started selling Jade Mountain Les Jumeaux from California for $30 a bottle. Emmanuel's Marketplace now offers 100 cheeses from Europe, pheasant sausages, organic produce and Greek olives from a barrel. ''In January, we put in a lobster tank,'' said Jim Phillips, the manager.,Mr. Leitch, 31, a son of the Donovan, the 60's folk rocker, plans to concentrate on writing music while his wife, who resembles a Botticelli angel, explores painting and paganism. ''I won't be occupying my normal bar stool at Don Hill's anymore,'' he said.,Once a fixture in gossip columns and Manhattan clubs, dubbed an ''It Boy'' in the mid-90's, Mr. Leitch added: ''I was totally immersed in the whole scene five years ago. But going out is not my No. 1 priority now.'' To celebrate the move to his three-bedroom house last Thanksgiving, he led a New Age drum circle in the woods with 10 pals, including Ione Skye, his sister who is an actress, and Shalom Harlow, a former host of ''House of Style'' on MTV.,Julie Nicholls, a real estate broker who sold Mr. Leitch and Ms. Hume their home, said she had chauffeured around other fashion industry people looking for property, though she would not identify them. ''All I know is that I've worked with lots of beautiful women recently,'' she said.,Compared with the Hamptons or Connecticut, real estate values are a relative bargain: modest farmhouses sell in the $200,000 range.  Weekenders prefer rural homes with privacy and historic character, but full-time residents prefer houses in town. Special touches like chicken coops and fireplaces are prized. The average price of a house bought by weekenders has risen 10 percent in the last two years, to about $160,000, said Harris Safier, a real estate broker who owns Westwood Metes & Bounds, which has three offices in Ulster County.,Besides Woodstock, a town long associated with unreconstructed hippies, the most desirable communities include Olive, High Falls, Stone Ridge (known for its 18th-century Dutch grit-stone houses) and the region northwest of Woodstock in Greene County, which includes the ski areas at Hunter and Windham.,Ms. Nickerson of Vogue and her husband, Neville Wakefield, a writer, recently built a black slant-roofed house reminiscent of a chicken coop in West Kill, in Greene County, with sweeping views of the Catskills. Their guest house is a tepee with heated rocks for warmth. Their architect, Ross Anderson, also designed Isaac Mizrahi's apartment and the Bumble and Bumble hair salon in Manhattan.,''It's a 40-minute round trip to get a pint of milk, and the hills and dales are a protection from the more touristy areas like Windham,'' Ms. Nickerson said. ''I want it to remain private, a real retreat, not like the Hamptons, which is a hideous experience.'',But the desire to keep their neck of the woods undiscovered didn't prevent the couple from displaying the house in a six-page spread in the January Vogue, in which Ms. Nickerson was pictured (from behind, in a bikini bottom) taking an outdoor shower.,Like Ms. Nickerson, many of the fashion folk who have found their way to the area say they have no desire to import a Hamptons-style social whirl, in which the same players who party together in Manhattan continue the fun on the weekend. ''We don't like the Hamptons,'' Mr. Leitch said. ''You see the same people from New York, even those you really don't want to see.'',And yet, habits can be hard to break. Mr. Leitch said he hoped to hold ''dress-up nights'' for friends in Woodstock, similar to the ones he has had in New York, like the recent Bowery Bar party where guests  came in retro ski wear.,One of Ms. Nickerson's friends and house guests, Daryl Kerrigan, the fashion designer, contends that the region is already too crowded with the fabulous set. ''In Ulster County, you see people from New York,'' she said. ''I've run into people at the farmers' market.'',Ms. Kerrigan spends weekends at a her house in Wayne County, Pa., where all she sees is dairy cows and the occasional bald eagle soaring above the Delaware River.,Not far from Ms. Nickerson and Mr. Wakefield's house, Tony Goldman, who owns the Tiffany Hotel in Miami Beach and the SoHo Kitchen and Bar on Greene Street in Manhattan, has bought 27 buildings along Main Street of tiny Maplecrest and is developing the Sugar Maple Resort. Mr. Goldman envisions a kind of arts camp for grown-ups, with studio spaces just five minutes from the Hunter Mountain ski area. ''It's designed to be neither a social scene nor an art scene, but rather a creative environment to energize people spiritually and mentally,'' he said. He hopes to open in the summer of 2000.,Mr. Goldman, too, rejects Hamptons style. ''The scene in the Hamptons is a traffic jam,'' he said. ''There they want to see and be seen as power players. The people upstate are more comfortable with themselves.'',As taxes and property values creep up (the average single-family home in Ulster rose from $146,543 in 1997 to $152,231 last year, according the county's Board of Realtors), there is some resentment of newcomers by longtime residents. ''There is a concern about how their children won't be able to remain,'' said Mr. Safier, the real estate broker, who has lived in the county for 22 years. ''There's always some of this conflict with some of the dyed-in-the-wool locals, people whose families have been here for generations. Some of them work for the county or town. However, there are a lot of carpenters and tradespeople who benefit from the weekend residents.'',Lori Childers, publisher of The Blue Stone Press, a newspaper that covers High Falls, Stone Ridge, Accord, Rosendale and other hamlets, said: ''The local population is very diverse and is not easily split into weekenders, transplants and locals, even though sometimes when people are angry they throw around these words as though they meant something definitive. I see many weekenders trying to find a way to live here as their primary residence.'',''There will always be tensions in a changing and growing community,'' she said. ''Everyone lives here because they love it. This brings even the most different types of people together.'',Last Christmas, Mark Baker, a New York night-life promoter who meditates occasionally at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Karma Triyana Dharmachakra, near Woodstock, visited Henri Kessler's five-bedroom, five-fireplace farmhouse  in Malden-on-Hudson.,Mr. Kessler, who in the 1980's held court with the hard-partying authors Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis as a club promoter for Area and Danceteria, bought his property, called Shatamuck, in November.,''When I'm up there, I'm into fixing my house, boating and taking pilot's lessons,'' said Mr. Kessler, the producer of an independent film,  ''Slam,'' which won prizes at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals last year. ''You can all get together or never see anyone.'',He sometimes spends weekend afternoons with friends who live nearby, Dr. Darwin Bushman, a psychiatrist, and his wife, Rika Okamoto, a principal dancer with the Martha Graham company who is cast in the title role of Steven Spielberg's forthcoming ''Memoirs of a Geisha.'',Dr. Bushman said he used to live a hedonistic existence and was once a fixture at Flowers, the model-y restaurant in New York where Mr. Baker was a host.,''I dated models and led a vacuous life,'' Dr. Bushman said. ''But after years of going out for six hours with nothing to say, I started to attend arts events in search of a woman of culture and substance.'' That is how he met Ms. Okamoto.,His renouncing of his once-vacuous life may not have come a moment too soon. Now, the models are coming to Ulster County. Mr. Baker said he knows about 15 who have bought in the area in the last year.  And Mr. Nutley, the party organizer, said: ''I've seen them walking on the street and speaking their language. They use catch phrases like 'fabulous,' 'darling' and 'fierce.' Now, I'd rather not talk to anyone.''",SUSAN M. KIRSCHBAUM,"FEB. 28, 1999",Yipes!

"Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin was back in a hospital today to receive new treatment for a stomach ulcer, the latest in a series of ailments that have all but sidelined him for several months.,The new health problem was another blow to Mr. Yeltsin's hopes of staging a convincing comeback after months of illness and waning authority, although it was not considered serious enough to force his Prime Minister to cancel plans to go on vacation.,Doctors said they had advised Mr. Yeltsin to stay in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital for a few days after an examination today showed that the ulcer, which forced him to spend two weeks in a hospital in January, had started bleeding slightly again.,''Unfortunately there is a worsening of the stomach ulcer, which has not fully healed,'' Sergei Mironov, the chief Kremlin doctor, said in comments broadcast by the ORT television channel. ''There is of course no threat to the president's life.'',The Kremlin had said on Wednesday that Mr. Yeltsin, 68, had completed his rehabilitation from the ulcer.,But Dr. Mironov said new problems could have been caused by Mr. Yeltsin's workload, including a recent trip to Jordan and meetings with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China on Thursday and the heads of four former Soviet republics on Friday.,''You saw what a full work schedule the President had, especially in the last two days,'' Dr. Mironov said.  ''Of course that had a certain effect. Boris Nikolayevich got a bit tired, of course. Yesterday he did not feel very well, and said he felt some discomfort and weakness.'',The Interfax news agency quoted Dr. Mironov as saying he had told Kremlin aides that the President, often described as a difficult patient who ignores his doctors' advice, should reduce his workload for the next few days.,The presidential press secretary, Dmitri Yakushkin, said Mr. Yeltsin felt ''O.K.'' He said the President had spoken to Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov by telephone from the hospital and told him to go ahead with his planned 10-day holiday in southern Russia.,The ulcer is the latest in a series of complaints, including bronchitis, exhaustion and pneumonia, that have kept Mr. Yeltsin out of public view for much of the last five months. He had quintuple heart bypass surgery in November 1996.",REUTERS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Yeltsin Is Hospitalized Again for Ulcer Treatment,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/world/yeltsin-is-hospitalized-again-for-ulcer-treatment.html
"THE capture this month of the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan has focused new attention on the war he has waged against the Turkish army for 14 years. In recruiting fighters and supporters, Mr. Ocalan has fed on the resentment many Kurds feel for what they consider the Government's unjust discrimination against them. But he could never have built such a potent force without great amounts of help from other countries.,There are many reasons why Mr. Ocalan found foreign supporters for his bloody rebellion against Turkish rule, and why Turkey has resisted his rebellion so fiercely. Some are to be found in history, others in psychology, and still others in geopolitics.,Lurking behind them all, however, is water.,For more than a decade until last October, Mr. Ocalan lived semi-clandestinely in Syria, and the Syrian Government gave him money, arms and political cover. Iraq also helped him, allowing him to build bases along the Iraqi-Turkish border. Neither Syria nor Iraq were embracing his cause out of any love for Kurds; on the contrary, governments in both countries have fiercely repressed their own Kurdish populations.,But Syria and Iraq want water from rivers that spring from Turkish soil. Turkey has given them what it considers ample amounts of water, but rejects what it calls their ''unacceptable claims.'' They have supported Mr. Ocalan's fighters as a way of applying pressure on Turkey to give them more water.,The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers created the ''Fertile Crescent'' where some of the first civilizations emerged. Today they are immensely important resources, politically as well as geographically. Through a system of dams in its southeastern provinces, Turkey controls their flow and is determined not to give up its control. That is one important reason that Turkish leaders have so resolutely refused to grant any autonomy to the Kurdish region, which straddles both rivers.,Few if any countries understand the growing importance of water as fully as Turkey does. In one of the world's largest public works undertakings, Turkey is spending $32 billion for the huge Southeast Anatolia Project, a complex of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric plants. Its centerpiece, the Ataturk Dam on the Euphrates River, is already completed. In the reservoir that has built up behind the dam, sailing and swimming competitions are being held on a spot where for centuries there was little more than desert.,When the project is completed, perhaps in the next decade, it is expected to increase the amount of irrigated land in Turkey by 40 percent and provide one-fourth of the country's electric power needs. Planners hope this can improve the standard of living of six million of Turkey's poorest people, most of them Kurds, and thus undercut the appeal of revolutionary separatism. It will also deprive Syria and Iraq of resources those countries believe they need -- resources that Turkey fears might ultimately be used in anti-Turkish causes.,The region of Turkey where Kurds predominate is more or less the same region covered by the Southeast Anatolia Project, encompassing an area about the size of Austria. Giving that region autonomy by placing it under Kurdish self-rule could weaken the central Government's control over the water resource that it recognizes as a keystone of its future power.,In other ways also, Turkish leaders are using their water as a tool of foreign as well as domestic policy. Among their most ambitious new projects is one to build a 50-mile undersea pipeline to carry water from Turkey to the parched Turkish enclave on northern Cyprus. The pipeline will carry more water than northern Cyprus can use, and foreign mediators like Richard C. Holbrooke, deeply frustrated by their inability to break the political deadlock on Cyprus, are hoping that the excess water can be sold to the ethnic Greek republic on the southern part of the island as a way of promoting peace.,It is no accident that President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey is a water engineer by profession and entered public life as director of the State Waterworks Administration. His background and that of his classmate in engineering school, the late President Turgut Ozal, have done much to make Turkey so water conscious. Both men vigorously supported the Southeast Anatolia Project in the 1980's even though Western countries including the United States refused to provide loans or credits for it because they did not want to alienate Arab countries.,One of the most important developments in the Middle East in the last 20 years has been the emergence of a strong partnership between Turkey and Israel. Both countries have much to gain from it; for Israel water is among the greatest potential benefits. Israel is thirsting for water, and Turkey is overflowing with it. Intensive studies are now under way to see whether tankers, pipelines or other means can be used to send Turkey's water to its new Israeli friends. Not coincidentally, the basis for the Turkey-Israel partnership was laid when Mr. Demirel headed the Turkish Government and another water engineer, Yitzhak Rabin, was in power in Israel. ''If we solve every other problem in the Middle East but do not satisfactorily resolve the water problem, our region will explode,'' Mr. Rabin once said. Other Middle Eastern leaders have agreed. The late King Hussein of Jordan asserted that conflicts over water ''could drive nations of the region to war.'',Turkey may be the world's most water-conscious country, and the Middle East the region where water issues are most urgent. But competition for water, and for the power that control of water represents, is intensifying from Africa and Central Asia to Los Angeles and the Everglades. ''The world's population of 5.9 billion will double in the next 40 to 90 years,'' former Senator Paul Simon has written in a new book titled ''Tapped Out'' that examines global water problems. ''Our water supply, however, is constant,'' he wrote, as ''per capita water consumption is rising twice as fast as the world's population. You do not have to be an Einstein to understand that we are headed toward a potential calamity.'',COUNTRIES that control water are likely to be the big winners of the future. Turkey is among them. Its policies have for years been shaped by a desire to use water to achieve political aims, and the policies are beginning to pay off.,''Water has been used as a means of pressure, for example the Syrians sponsoring Kurdish separatism because they want more water,'' said Ishak Alaton, a visionary Turkish businessman whose company has won the contract to build the water pipeline to Cyprus and is conducting a feasibility study for a pipeline to Israel. ''It can also be used for peace, as we are hoping in Cyprus. You can't overstate its importance. I firmly believe that just as the 20th century was the century of oil, the 21st century will be the century of water.'',Why They Fight,The Kurdish rebellion in Turkey is often presented as one phase of a fight to reclaim and ancient national history that has been thwarted only by arbitrary lines drawn on a map by outside powers.,Turkey, however, sees it differently. Water is power. Turkey has it in abundance. It's neighbors, by and large, do not. And Turkey can turn the spigot on and off for two of it's most important neighbors, Syria and Iraq, through a system of dams in the Kurdish parts of eastern Turkey where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers rise.,These are the rivers, that, since before biblical times, have been able to transorm desert lands into life-giving farmland. And the power that controlling the water bestows is something that Turkey is not prepared to give up, Kurdish insurrection or no.",STEPHEN KINZER,"FEB. 28, 1999","The World; Where Kurds Seek a Land, Turks Want the Water",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/the-world-where-kurds-seek-a-land-turks-want-the-water.html
"Q. My boss often tells me I am his best worker. His praise is gratifying, and he backs it up with raises each year. But his attitude that I am irreplaceable makes it difficult for me to take any time off, even when I'm ill. I'm not the only talented worker in the office, but because I am given all the most challenging assignments, I'm the only one with experience doing them. How can I keep my boss's high regard from leaving me stuck at my desk?,A. Maybe your supervisor is an evil management genius, exploiting your work ethic at the expense of your personal life. But more likely, he just doesn't see the problem. ''It's easy for a boss to single in on one person they know they can depend on; it's not done  intentionally, but as a convenience,'' said Gerald E. Holmes, a director of media relations for General Motors who has held several supervisory positions there.,Your first step, then, is to educate the boss. Ask for a meeting, advised Deb Koen, vice president of Career Development Services, a nonprofit agency based in Rochester that provides workplace advice and education. The request will send a signal that you have something serious to discuss, while the meeting itself will give you a chance to lay out the problem.,When explaining the situation, take care not to imply that your boss is the bad guy. Emphasize how much you value his high opinion of you, Mr. Holmes said, adding, ''Make it clear that you appreciate his confidence but that you need to find a way to share the workload.'',To avoid the appearance of whining, Ms. Koen suggests stating the issue, waiting for a reaction and then asking your boss for advice on achieving some balance in your life.,Not that you should expect your boss to have all the answers. ''Certainly you should go in with your own ideas and priorities and  actions that you might want to take,'' Ms. Koen said. ''What are the limits you'd like to see established?'',One possible approach: You could ask that you become a mentor for co-workers -- to prepare them for assuming some of your duties, Mr. Holmes said. ''This would spread the workload,'' he said, ''and build your boss's confidence in other members of the staff.'' The suggestion will make it clear that you are thinking not only of your own interests, but also of ways to make the company stronger.,But even after you discuss the problem, and agree upon solutions, it's up to you to insure that progress is being made. ''Your boss has established a pattern that works  very well for him, and he may cling to that approach because you have been so willing to always accommodate,'' Ms. Koen said. ''Nothing will change without a concerted effort on your part.'',Schedule vacation time, she advised, and stick to it -- ''even if it's just a long weekend.'',The sooner your boss recognizes that even Superman needs the occasional break, the better off everyone will be.,Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

"PRESIDENT RICHARD M. NIXON was a man obsessed. Ample illumination of this comes in new transcripts of tapes secretly recorded in the White House between 1971 and 1973.,The following bits of conversation, previously withheld from the public on grounds of national security, show Mr. Nixon and his aides trying to directly implicate the late President John F. Kennedy in the November 1963 assassination of President Ngo Dihn Diem of South Vietnam.,With that killing, South Vietnam's weak civilian leadership died and ''U.S. policy in Vietnam plunged into the unknown,'' in the words of the authors of the Pentagon Papers, the secret Government history of the Vietnam war published by The New York Times in 1971.,Afterward, Mr. Nixon discussed how to pin the murder on the man who defeated him for the Presidency in 1960, in a vote that Mr. Nixon always considered a stolen election.,Yet not even the President was able to compel the national-security bureaucracy to declassify secrets. The public record available today shows that while American officials, including President Kennedy, approved of the military coup in which President Diem was assassinated, they did not directly order his death.,The tapes were released last week by the National Archives, and transcripts of them were prepared by the privately financed Nixon Presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif.   TIM WEINER,July 1, 1971, the Oval Office. The President sees a silver lining in the publication of the Pentagon Papers, which undermined support for the war:,Nixon: Murder of Diem -- Kennedy decided to go forward and got us involved, and it shows that Kennedy was the one who got us in the damn war. We got the Kennedys in this thing now.,Oct. 8, 1971, the Oval Office. John D. Ehrlichman, the domestic policy chief, suggests that the Presidential aide Charles W. Colson be given the job of digging up embarrassing files:,Ehrlichman: Suppose we get all the Diem stuff and supposing there's something we can really hang Teddy [Kennedy] or the Kennedy clan with. I'm going to want to put that in Colson's hands.,Nixon: Yep.,Ehrlichman: And we're going to really run with it.,Aug. 11, 1971, the Oval Office. The President and Mr. Colson discuss possible Congressional hearings in the wake of the Pentagon Papers' release:,Colson: Can you imagine Averell Harriman [Ambassador at Large under President Kennedy] before that committee, explaining why he didn't get Diem out of Vietnam when he had the chance?,Nixon: I want that out. I want him before the committee. . . . I said that he was murdered, that they murder. . . . I knew what the bastards were up to.,Sept. 18, 1971, the Oval Office:,Nixon: We've got all these people who were involved in this -- and they're all, in one way or another, involved in the assassination of Diem. . . . The Diem incident is perhaps the best [unintelligible], because it involves Harriman, who is [Sen. Edmund M.] Muskie's adviser [in the 1972 Presidential election campaign], and it involves Kennedy. . . .,Ehrlichman: [Richard M.] Helms [Director of Central Intelligence] would have a pluperfect fit.,Nixon: That doesn't bother me a bit. We owe Helms nothing. He owes us everything -- we kept him on. And we're going to let the C.I.A. take a whipping on this. That doesn't bother me a bit and I'm not going to hear that argument from Henry [Kissinger, the national security adviser] or anyone else. This Diem incident's got to get out. It's just got to get out. . . . I want the story of the Diem thing, everything in it -- I want it by the end of next week. That's an order. They will get it to me.  I will personally [tell] the whole story -- I intend to have it -- on the Diem incident. . . . The entire file on the Diem incident.,Ehrlichman: There's some C.I.A. stuff on the Bay of Pigs, apparently, that they will die first before they give us that, I understand. There's also some other stuff, some internal stuff over there --,H. R. Haldeman, chief of staff: I bet.,Ehrlichman: -- that we know about, but getting to it is like that big black block in Mecca, you know. . . . If we could just get a friend in the hierarchy over there who would let us in. . . .,Nixon: I consider it a top priority that I want the Diem story. Also on the Bay of Pigs thing, just -- I want an order to Helms and [deputy C.I.A. director Robert] Cushman that for my purposes, not for public release, I am to have the Bay of Pigs story. Now that's an order. And I expect it in one week, or I want his resignation on my desk. Put it as coldly as that. The Bay of Pigs story, the total story. Tell him I know a lot about it myself. But I've got to have it -- just because I'll be questioned about it myself, and I want to be able to know what to say. The Bay of Pigs story and the Diem story. . . . The whole folderol -- the way it happened, I've just got to know. . . . I will not brook any opposition on this. I've screwed around long enough. I've told Henry [Kissinger] and he has really dropped the ball on this.,March 28, 1973, the Executive Office Building. Despite President Nixon's insistence, secret C.I.A. and State Department files on the Diem assassination and the Bay of Pigs are not made public. The President's frustration continues for months, and years:,Nixon: Did you get the word on the declassification of everything over 10 years? That's got to move fast. And not only [unintelligible] but the other one's important -- on the Bay of Pigs. Just get the damn thing out, will you? That's going to be quite a story -- a few little morsels. Do you agree?,Haldeman: Yeah.,Nixon: Also gets into the Diem murder and the whole Diem thing. Now the war is over and we're not going to take Henry's crap. Henry's a little bit involved in that himself. That's why he doesn't want some of it declassified.,May 13, 1973, the White House. A telephone conversation between the President and Alexander M. Haig, his military adviser. The President, still harping on Diem and the Bay of Pigs, mentions the White House operative E. Howard Hunt, who fabricated diplomatic cables and documents implicating President Kennedy:,Nixon: I think we should just declassify everything going back -- everything that's 10 years old, and declassify the whole Bay of Pigs, plus the Diem thing.  Goddammit, you know, that's -- that can only be helpful. Now you say, ''Well, it'll stir things up in Vietnam.'' The hell with it. You don't like that, huh?,Haig: I'm not sure, sir. I think it's a thing that should be considered. . . .,Nixon: Doggone it, I'd like to do it, because -- look, I have not looked at the Bay of Pigs stuff, but I know there's stuff in there that makes [McGeorge] Bundy [President Kennedy's national security adviser] look like a goddamn -- uh, you know, terrible. . . . Goddammit, you know what happened is, they set in motion a chain of events which resulted in the murder of Diem.,Haig: Oh, there's no question about that. None. . . . In fact, you know, the Vice President's aide was there. He was Lodge's assistant [when Henry Cabot Lodge was Ambassador to South Vietnam].  I talked to him some years ago about that.,Nixon: What'd he say?,Haig: He said . . . the poor guy called Lodge on the phone, and said, ''They're going to kill me, for God's sake, send some Marine guards up here.'',Nixon: This is a good juicy thing to get out. . . . I mean, that was what Hunt was looking into, you know, and screwed it up. But the point is, there's a hell of a record there. Now, somebody -- have you got some trusted person that can look at that goddamn thing, and let's declassify it. It's 10 years old, huh?,Haig: Yes, I can get somebody to do it.,May 14, 1973, the Executive Office Building:,Nixon: I want the Diem, and the Bay of Pigs totally declassified, and I want it done in 48 hours.  Now you tell Haig that. It'll drive him up the wall, too. But I want it done. Do you understand? This is 10 years old! Declassify it. We've got a couple of [expletive] working on this thing. Do you see any reason why it shouldn't be declassified, Ron?,Ronald L. Ziegler, press secretary: No, I see no reason.,Nixon: I want them to get off -- now, Haig is disturbed because of the ironies involved in the murder of Diem. Now listen, this government murdered him.

"MOST dramas have their sub-plots, and the talks that stalled last week over Yugoslavia's torn province of Kosovo were no exception. While the big theme was war and peace in the Balkans, a lesser-noted coda was the complicated bond between Prime Minister Tony Blair's Britain and continental Europe that, just weeks ago, promised a new hope of containing conflagration on the continent's doorstep.,Britain, of course, has always been an ambivalent European, seeking to mold the continent's affairs -- often from the sidelines -- even as it holds onto a special relationship with Washington that long predates European integration.,At first glance, this dual vision seems seeded with conflict. But the course of the Kosovo talks may, in fact, have validated Mr. Blair's desire to keep his options open as he tries to make the case that Britain is a major player.,The suspension of the negotiations on Kosovo until March 15 was first of all a severe blow to the prestige of the American Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, who placed her influence on the line for three straight days in a vain attempt to emulate the American diplomatic success at Dayton, Ohio, that ended the Bosnian war.,But her very presence at the negotiations -- and the use of the threat of American-led NATO bombing to get the talks started -- illuminated another reality. Once again, the Americans had taken a leading role in the negotiations because Europeans, acting by themselves, could not do it on their own.,Nobody ever envisioned such talks without the Americans, but their dominant role at the end was not in the original script, certainly not as seen from here.,The negotiations began under the joint sponsorship of France and Britain -- the two countries that would provide the bulk of a NATO-led ground force (along with American, Russian and other troops) to police a peace settlement. The French and British readiness to commit those forces was seen here as a token not just of Europe's frustration at past American diplomatic high-handedness in the Balkans, but also of a desire to make a new start after the tragic blunders of the recent past.,''This time we are seeing a greater effort by the Europeans to see that they get it right and do not leave it all to the Americans,'' Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research group regarded as close to Mr. Blair's New Labor Government, said as the talks got under way. That in itself was a departure from the earlier days of European embroilment in the breakup of Yugoslavia, when Germany was singled out for its diplomatic clumsiness and Dutch troops under the United Nations flag stood by at the massacre at Srebrenica.,More important, this new sense of joint European endeavor was being ignited just weeks after 11 European nations (including France, but not Britain) launched their single currency, the euro. This accomplishment had challenged Britain to rethink its relationships to the Continent.,Only last week, Mr. Blair nudged his country closer to eventual adoption of the euro by setting out a tentative schedule for joining. But he hedged his plan with so many economic and political caveats that, even if Britons do overcome their aversion to abandoning the cherished pound, their country almost certainly would be the last of the four hold-outs to enter the euro-zone.,The broader implications of that hesitancy had long been apparent to Mr. Blair. As the advent of the new currency approached, he sensed that Britain might wind up on the sidelines. But he had an alternative strategy: to emphasize Britain's military and diplomatic leadership, building on what Britain sees as a privileged position in Washington that enhances its ability to mold Europe's destiny.,THAT was one element in the decision to offer a new European initiative in the Balkans. When Mr. Blair traveled to the French town of St. Malo late last year to meet Lionel Jospin, his French counterpart, he was ''frustrated that the Americans were running the show on Kosovo and the Europeans were not,'' said Mr. Grant. The result was the so-called ''St. Malo initiative'' -- an effort to forge a common European defense policy.,But now, a French diplomat remarked the other day, it seems that the initiative's first tests came a little too soon. Not only did the Americans turn out to have played a larger role than anticipated in the Kosovo talks, but Britain made it abundantly clear that its European commitment was intended to complement, not replace, the time-tested ties to Washington that some British critics depict as a slavish readiness to do Uncle Sam's bidding.,Alone among its supposed European partners, Britain sent its warplanes to bomb Iraq last December, while the rest of Europe -- France in particular -- looked on disapprovingly. And while Mr. Blair and Mr. Jospin foresaw the creation of a pan-European defense industry as part of their initiative, two of Britain's biggest defense contractors went their own way last month, announcing a merger that left potential French and German suitors smarting.,As ever, Britain seems to be carving out its own role -- European by trade and geography, but not in its soul, an island only 22 miles from France that feels closer in strategic and economic philosophy to the United States.,''There are fundamental political and historical differences in the perception of security'' separating Britain and its European partners, said Col. Terence Taylor of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ''And because of these fundamental differences, Britain can stand with the United States where others cannot.'',Indeed, after last month's British defense merger, Josef Joffe, a German newspaper columnist in Munich, remarked that the deal ''will keep Britain going as a global player, which in some respects is more important than being a European power.'',''Europe is doing well on economic integration, but it will not be a strategic partner for some time to come,'' he said.",ALAN COWELL,"FEB. 28, 1999","The World: One Foot in Washington; Britain's in Europe, Sort of",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/the-world-one-foot-in-washington-britain-s-in-europe-sort-of.html
"After months of being stalked, a Brooklyn woman stabbed and killed her former boyfriend on Friday afternoon when he forced his way into her house and began to beat her, law enforcement officials said.,Assistant District Attorney Dennis Hawkins said the Brooklyn District Attorney's office would decline to prosecute the woman, Aliceson Haile, in the killing of Alwyn Chan, unless new evidence surfaced. He said a witness supported Ms. Haile's account that Mr. Chan attacked her with a three-foot-long sharpened stick.,''There is an issue of self-defense here, she had a court order of protection against this individual, and he should not have been in her house,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''At this point we would need to see other evidence to proceed criminally.'',Ms. Haile, 30, had known Mr. Chan, 45, for nearly two years, dating him on and off until two or three months ago, neighbors and prosecutors said. The relationship involved frequent fights and bickering, said neighbors inside the woman's apartment building on New York Avenue in East Flatbush, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ms. Haile's friends said that she endured almost constant mistreatment and physical attacks, prosecutors said.,After the fights, they said, Mr. Chan, also of East Flatbush, was often at Ms. Haile's door with groceries and presents, and an apology.,But neighbors said the relationship worsened after Ms. Haile began to date one of her former boyfriends again. After that, the neighbors said, Mr. Chan could often be heard yelling to her third-floor apartment from the courtyard.,On Feb. 1, Ms. Haile made a frantic call asking to have Mr. Chan arrested after a fight at her home. She was covered with bruises, said prosecutors who charged Mr. Chan with assault after her call.,The court gave Ms. Haile an order of protection against him, but the next day, Mr. Chan was released on $1,500 bail, pending a court appearance on March 16. Despite the order, he continued to appear at the apartment complex, neighbors said.,Prosecutors described the fatal confrontation: Around 2 P.M. on Friday, as Ms. Haile talked with a friend, Mr. Chan knocked on the door. When she answered it, he pushed his way inside. He was carrying the sharpened stick, and he forced her back and beat her.,Ms. Haile ended up in a corner next to her kitchen window, with Mr. Chan slamming the window's iron security gate into her head, a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said. She grasped a knife on the kitchen counter, the official said, and plunged it into Mr. Chan's side.,A 911 call brought police to the scene.

"Picture Sancho Panza trying to lope forward without Don Quixote and the task of Rich Galen suggests itself as he hits the hustings once more at the head of Gopac, the strategizing and fund-raising vehicle for the conservative revolution once led by Newt Gingrich.,With all those many political windmills still standing out there, Mr. Gingrich is gone, purged from the House Speakership, and Mr. Galen, his sharp-tongued insurgent sidekick, dares not yield to any sense of exhaustion or despair, for there is a fresh campaign to be scouted and waged.,''Be careful what you wish for; you may get it,'' Mr. Galen responds with a grin to Democrats as well as Republicans who admit to him lately how vapid Washington seems with the hyperkinetic Mr. Gingrich gone.,''You miss Newt's political and intellectual energy,'' Mr. Galen concedes only briefly, for he must carry on in the post-Gingrich fray now as Gopac faces the next election with control of the House at stake and the Republicans nursing a mere six-vote majority.,The gemlike flame of the 1994 House Republican victory was nurtured in Gopac, with its well-organized outreach recruiting and training sessions for candidates who stormed into majority power in a historic upset. But now, in carrying Gopac forward, Mr. Galen must help defend the crippled G.O.P. margin in 2000, with Mr. Gingrich off in the wilderness and the party hurting from the failed impeachment trial of President Clinton.,''I think the Republican Party, with some justification, is trying consciously or unconsciously to wean itself from Gingrich -- possibly with too much ardor,'' said Mr. Galen, 52, who exemplifies the capital's permanent political cadre, the lesser-known devotees who endure beyond election results.,''It's not Stalinist, an erasure of history,'' he continued, pondering the party's identity crisis. ''But it's a strong sense that this ain't Newt's party anymore.'',It will be strategists like Mr. Galen and other onetime Gingrich stalwarts who will help tailor any fresh party image. He insists that in his visits to promising precincts, which stretch from county to national candidacies, he finds a party resolved, more than wounded.,''You can't get much lower than we were for the last two and a half months,'' Mr. Galen said of the impeachment struggle. As a maverick conservative, he had proposed an early negotiated settlement by Congressional leaders -- a proposal that saw him instantly excoriated by pro-impeachment Republicans.,He is characteristically unbowed, particularly from the pulpit of his Web page (www.mullings.com), where he has been entertainingly manic in explaining the capital's scandal culture to outsiders.,''We have been spinning and leaking and appearing and predicting and explaining and talking and making up jokes and making up excuses and getting made up and rolling our eyes and counting votes and reading more spicy material than we have since 1971 when we discovered the complete works of D. H. Lawrence were available in the college library under 'Classical Lit,' '' he summarized in one riff, asking, ''Isn't our system great?'',Mr. Galen, who was raised in New Hyde Park, N.Y., is a former radio news reporter who tried politics on a dare, won a city council seat in Marietta, Ohio, and then moved to Washington to become a Congressional and party strategist. He and Mr. Gingrich were cool toward each other at first, but eventually the Speaker had to wonder aloud that they made a good team. ''I told him, 'That's because I'm twice as smart as you thought I was and you're only half as crazy as I thought you were,' '' Mr. Galen fondly recalled.,''I'm finding a fresh burst of energy now because we've gone back to arguing the things we love to talk about,'' he said of tax-cut proposals and the rest of the nonimpeachment agenda that he dearly craves. ''And there ain't nothing better than legitimate Presidential contenders to re-energize a party.'' He expressed confidence that the Republicans could win the White House next year and retain majorities in both houses of Congress.,Beyond that optimism, Mr. Galen predicts ''a good old-fashioned 70's and 80's political cycle,'' with a focus on wholesome issues, and personal scandal relegated to the fringe. He said that the public wanted it that way and that neither party had much to campaign on in their impeachment performances of attacking and defending the President.,''I don't think this is accruing to Republicans anymore,'' he said of the public's resentment of impeachment. ''To the extent that people thought we should be punished, I think we have,'' he said of the shrunken House majority. ''It may well be that the real danger lies with Democrats who so ardently supported Clinton.'',Mr. Galen sounded wistful as he idealized politics as a creative contact sport, not the blood sport it has seemed lately.,''If you're going to be in politics, you have to be an optimist,'' he said, sounding humbled by the banishment of his Speaker, but already busy traveling and strategizing beyond the Gingrich revolution.",FRANCIS X.

"Winthrop K. Edey, who found nothing so fascinating as the mechanical clarity of antique clocks and the minutiae of his own offbeat life, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, near his home on the Upper West Side. He was 61 and had devoted his life to assembling one of the world's finest private collections of clocks and watches and to the extraordinary diary he had kept since he was 6 years old.,His family said the cause was Hodgkin's disease.,If he sometimes seemed eccentric -- and a man who strolled in Central Park wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, short black socks and brown wingtips inevitably would -- Mr. Edey, known as Kelly (a diminutive of his middle name, Kellogg), was simply not bound by life's usual constraints.,As the grandson of Morris W. Kellogg, an engineer who made millions designing and building oil refineries, not to mention the nation's World War II atomic-bomb plants, Mr. Edey was relieved of the need to earn a living. As a result, after growing up in Upper Brookville on Long Island, graduating from Amherst College and studying at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, he spent the rest of his life doing exactly what he felt like doing.,To Mr. Edey, who began taking clocks apart and putting them back together about the time he started his diary as a boy, what he felt like doing was pursuing his childhood interests with devotion.,Along the way, Mr. Edey, whose interest was less in the clocks' decorative cases than in the timeless beauty he saw in their intricate inner workings, became an internationally known expert on antique clocks, and collected them with such a discriminating eye that when he helped the Frick Collection assemble an exhibition of French clocks in 1982, nine of the finest specimens were from his own collection.,A creature of habit, Mr. Edey chose a life of such regularity that friends could set their watches by his schedule. He got up at 5 in the afternoon, and after an evening out with friends (dinner for them, breakfast for him), Mr. Edey would return to his West 83d Street town house and work through the night studying clocks, pursuing a separate and abiding interest in ancient Egypt and writing in his diary.,Described as Proustian in its sweep and attention to detail (Mr. Edey could devote several pages to the ramifications of a friend's failure to return a phone call) the multivolume diary, some of his friends are convinced, will someday be regarded as an important social document of New York life.,If so, it will be partly because Mr. Edey traveled in some heady art circles, befriending the likes of Andy Warhol (who included Mr. Edey in his 1963 underground movie, ''The 13 Most Beautiful Boys'') and Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as prominent gallery owners, museum officials and collectors.,Mr. Edey also developed a passionate interest in photography, assembling a small but impressive collection of photographs by Man Ray and others, and taking pictures of his own, generally New York street scenes and foreign landscapes.,Typically, Mr. Edey, a fussy sort who favored old-fashioned fountain pens over ballpoints and maintained his town house in such 19th century purity that it still has its original working gas jets, tapestries, stove, and marble-slab kitchen table, was not one to whip out a little Leica when he spotted an appealing scene on his extensive travels. Instead he, or rather his hapless traveling companion of the moment, would lug a huge wooden turn-of-the-century view camera complete with tripod and 11-by-14-inch glass plates. Although he continued to take pictures, which often had a dark, moody quality, after an exhibition in the early 1970's, Mr. Edey did not pursue photography professionally.,Mr. Edey is survived by a brother, Maitland, of Vineyard Haven, Mass., and two sisters, Beatrice Phear of Cambridge, Mass., and Marion Edey of Silver Spring, Md.,Mr. Edey, who began buying antique clocks before they became a collecting rage, continually refined and improved his collection of about 60 clocks and watches, 39 of which he has given to the Frick Collection, along with his diaries.,Pending an appraisal, Edgar Munhall, the Frick curator, would not venture a guess on how many millions the clock collection might be worth, but after taking a glance he suggested that the real treasure might be the diaries, whose publication future is yet to be determined.",ROBERT MCG.

"When William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States, gaveled the Clinton scandal into history on Feb. 12, those with a curatorial bent began wondering what will happen to the objects of the President's affection -- the artifacts that may testify to Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky long after both of them are gone. Whither the gifts -- the hatpin, ''Leaves of Grass,'' the Black Dog T-shirt -- and, yes, the Dress? What provisions are being made for their perpetuation in the curious gallery of anti-relics by which Presidential scandals and fiascoes live on in glass cases and the public imagination?,''It's tough to say what's going to happen to the dress,'' admits Steven Tilley, who for the past two decades has worked with the holdings at the National Archives that relate to the Kennedy assassination, Watergate and the various independent-counsel investigations that followed. The dress may yet, of course, figure in criminal proceedings against the President, but eventually, Tilley said, ''we would assume we'd get it. If we do, then we're going to retain it as a piece of evidence from this very, very visible and highly interesting investigation.'',A spokeswoman for the office of the independent counsel says that ''normally'' such subpoenaed items go ''back to the rightful owner,'' but adds that the disposition of Monica miscellanea has not been settled. ''Legal research is being done right now,'' she says, referring to all the materials held by the various independent counsels. Tilley adds that, so far, discussions between the archives and Ken Starr's operation have involved only documents, not wearables, and not the book of Whitman poems that Monica called ''the most sentimental'' of the President's presents.,If Congress, as many expect, refuses to renew the Independent Counsel Act, civil libertarians may cheer, but some historians are likely to sigh with regret. Since Watergate -- our first fully curated Presidential scandal -- special prosecutions have assured the survival of a whole Grand Guignol of historic illegality. The archives, for instance, preserves much of the paraphernalia used by the 1972 Watergate burglars and in the cover-up that followed: Bernard Barker's address book, Chap Stick tubes with hidden microphones and all the office equipment involved in what Tilley calls ''the Rose Mary stretch,'' the gymnastic explanation offered by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, of how she erased 18* minutes of tape. Advances in office technology yielded the archives some computer hard-drives from Oliver North's offices at the National Security Council.,Tilley says that the Nixon and Reagan libraries have never requested the loan of any Watergate or Iran-contra items for use in an exhibit on either subject. But a number of Presidential librarians point out that these institutions balance their scholarly and memorial aspects with more candor than one might suspect. The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., has just acquired the staircase that led toward the evacuation helicopters taking off from the American Embassy in Saigon. Richard Norton Smith, the museum's director, admits that while Ford was pleased to get the object, some of the institution's trustees did not want to own something so associated with, if not scandal, then at least national humiliation.,Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, recalls how L.B.J., not too long before his death, judged some antiwar citizen mail being marked for a Vietnam display not nearly ''mean enough.'' He urged the librarians to substitute more evocatively abusive items, including one postcard that read: ''I demand that you as a gutless son of a bitch resign as President of the U.S.'' Middleton says he has ''tried very, very hard'' to find the infamous stuffed ballot box that may have helped send ''Landslide Lyndon'' to the Senate in 1948.,Because Judith Campbell's name appears on handwritten logs of both telephone calls and appearances at the White House visitors gate, the John F. Kennedy Library could not eliminate this Presidential girlfriend from the historical record. Before the existence of Government-run libraries (there are none prior to Herbert Hoover's), it was easier to clean up after the Chief Executive. The biographer Carl Sferrazza Anthony points out that after Warren G. Harding's sudden death in 1923, the President's secretary, George Christian, probably destroyed photographs of the President's mistress and illegitimate daughter, which Harding kept in his Oval Office desk.,Materials from the Clinton trial will remain the property of the Senate that conducted it. The curved tables at which the House managers and White House lawyers sat have been marked, so that their historical function will not be forgotten after the furniture is moved and used elsewhere. The deposition videotapes will go to the archives, along with one of the misprinted pens -- Untied States Senator, says the barrel -- used by the legislators to sign their oath as jurors. The object may eventually join a handful of highly select materials in the sliding metal drawers of the Archives' legislative division, which includes the now-much-discussed censure of Andrew Jackson and its later repeal. The depth of feeling in Jackson's day is simply not graspable without looking at his censure: the angrily literal expunction is written right across the offending language in the original document. The tally sheet for Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial, during which Senator Edmund G. Ross displayed his profile in courage by casting the deciding vote for acquittal, rests in another drawer. (Lest all this seem excessively majestic, the archivists direct a visitor's notice to a different sort of item carefully wrapped in plastic: the first issue of Mad magazine, hauled before a 1950's Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency.),Skip Rutherford, local planning coordinator for the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark., concedes that this future facility will have to address the events that led to impeachment. If it were up to Rutherford personally, neither the gifts nor the dress would be exhibited, but all such decisions will be made by professionals at some later time. ''We don't even have an architect on board yet,'' he says.,The dress may be an extreme example of memorabilia, but the impulse to preserve it is still more healthy than prurient. For one thing, its existence determined the entire course of the scandal. More important, in an age of virtual reality (even virtual, videotaped witnesses), it remains grotesquely real, almost literally alive with its stain of Presidential DNA. It is a messy, assertive fact that no amount of photography and digitalization could hope to replicate. And it is the same with the gifts. No matter how cheap or goofy or exquisite, they evoke the connection between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky far more compellingly than, say, the computerized records of hush money might have. The Black Dog T-shirt is not an object to inspire much awe or heartbreak -- like, say, the string with which Lincoln repaired his own spectacles, preserved in a box at the Library of Congress -- but like it or not, it, too, now belongs to the ages.",THOMAS MALLON,"FEB. 28, 1999",Will Monica Ever Get Her Blue Dress Back?,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/will-monica-ever-get-her-blue-dress-back.html
"To the Editor:,Your Feb. 23 front-page article on New York City's efforts to seize the cars of those arrested for drunken driving is encouraging. Finally, someone is getting tough with people who put the lives of tens of thousands of safe drivers and pedestrians at risk.,You report the case of Pavel Grinberg, an immigrant charged with driving while intoxicated, and you quote his lawyer as saying ''he is terrified. It's really overwhelming for him,'' because a conviction could threaten Mr. Grinberg's immigration status.,Perhaps someone should remind Mr. Grinberg's lawyer that the rest of us are also terrified. We are terrified by those who place our lives at risk because of their irresponsible behavior.,MORRIS WOHL,Cherry Hill, N.J., Feb. 23, 1999",,"FEB. 28, 1999",Why Not Take Cars Of Drunken Drivers?,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/opinion/l-why-not-take-cars-of-drunken-drivers-547808.html
"WHEN Jack Garvey lay down John Grisham's ''Partner'' before falling asleep several years ago, he had no hint that his novel-reading days were over. But when the letters started floating on the page the next morning, he learned that he had macular degeneration, an irreversible condition that affects more than 10 million Americans 55 and older. Mr. Garvey, who said he was older than 60, and who owns a real estate business here, bought himself a machine that could magnify letters 35 times, but his disease outpaced the machine's ability to help him. Even now, his blue eyes give no hint of trouble as he describes the frustration of not being able to read on his own.,Rita Grunbaum, 88, learned she had macular degeneration two years ago. An car accident then compounded her eye problems, leaving her to read laboriously with a magnifying glass. Recorded books do not appeal to her, Ms. Grunbaum said, because, as a former photographer, ''I'm a very visual person; I like to see.'',Now, a magnification device the size of a personal computer is helping people like Ms. Grunbaum and Mr. Garvey regain their visual independence. The machine, donated to the Larchmont Public Library by the Charles A. Mastronardi Foundation, a private family foundation in Mamaroneck, uses a combination of optics and electronics to magnify texts or photographs from 4 to 100 times.  Readers can choose from several foreground and background colors and can easily control their reading speed; the machine works as well with personal papers, newspapers and magazines as it does with books.,Similar devices are proving popular elsewhere in the county. The Chappaqua Library, White Plains Public Library, Katonah Village Library and the Yonkers Public Library's Will Branch all own machines that magnify texts. The Getty Square branch in Yonkers has a Kurzweil reading machine, which reads printed materials aloud as well as magnifying print. Not everyone who uses the machines has a serious eye condition. Gloria Arana, who came to Larchmont from Ecuador last December, can often be found in the library corner here where the magnification device is kept. ''I love to read,'' she said, ''but I frequently lose my glasses.''",ROBERTA HERSHENSON,"FEB. 28, 1999","When the Eyes Fail, a Magnifying Device Sends a Ray of Light",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/when-the-eyes-fail-a-magnifying-device-sends-a-ray-of-light.html
"In a state always abuzz with trends aborning, Santa Barbara remains a placid throwback to the quieter days of the California dream. With its old Spanish and Craftsman-style homes, acres of lush landscaping and laid-back beach, it's a perfect place to be reminded of the Golden State as it once was. In winter,  crowds are lighter and the weather is still often glorious, if less reliably perfect than in the longer, warmer days of summer.,From Montecito, the quiet enclave on the city's southeast end that is the playground of movie stars and old-money golfers, to the wine country stretching northwest from town into the Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara's natural beauty remains remarkably unspoiled. The University of California campus in suburban Goleta adds a stimulating college-town feel, and as the biggest cultural beachhead between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city has more than its share of artistic attractions.,Over a decade ago, in an effort to boost off-season tourism, city officials helped start a winter film festival. Now the city's official tourism organization is known as the Santa Barbara Conference and Visitors Bureau and Film Commission. The festival opens Thursday and runs for 11 days, with more than 125 films, including 18 world premieres, to be screened in various downtown locations. The festival does not yet rival Sundance or Cannes for star wattage, but its location just 90 minutes north of Los Angeles means it draws plenty of interest. This year it will honor Sally Field with a newly created award, with salutes to Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould.,The festival opens with a free block party on the State Street mall downtown, and the opening film is the premiere of ''This Is My Father,'' a love story starring Aidan Quinn, John Cusack, James Caan and Stephen Rea. The closing-night film is ''Alegria,'' the first feature film inspired by Cirque du Soleil, the international circus-arts ensemble.,In between, the event encompasses everything from ''An Evening With Bruce Vilanch,'' a wild-eyed comedy writer responsible for jokes on countless awards shows, to a screenwriting seminar with Nora Ephron, Carrie Fisher, Gary Ross (author of ''Big'' and ''Pleasantville'') and Marc Norman (co-author of ''Shakespeare in Love'').,Though organizers expect most events to sell out, the public can buy tickets to screenings at the door; passes start at six tickets for $45. Special events and seminars, priced separately, require reservations. Call (805) 963-0023, fax (805) 962-2524; www.sbfilmfestival.com.,Events,One of the film festival sites is the  Arlington Theater, downtown at 1317 State Street, a 2,000-seat 1931 movie palace with a trompe l'oeil star-studded ceiling that creates the illusion of a night sky. It is also home to the Santa Barbara Symphony, under the direction of Gisele Ben-Dor. The orchestra has weekend performances this winter, featuring a program of  Beethoven and Mozart on March 20 and 21, including Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and Mendelssohn and Rossini arias on April 10 and 11. Performances Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Saturday tickets, $17 to $39, Sunday, $17 to $30. Call (805) 963-4408.,The 680-seat Lobero Theater at 33 East Canon Perdido Street, (805) 963-0761, bills itself as ''the best place to see anything.'' On March 26 at 8 P.M. the theater will present ''Vincent,'' a one-man show about Vincent van Gogh; $15 or $25. For $100, a package includes the play and a bus trip to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's van Gogh exhibit.,The Santa Barbara Grand Opera Association stages ''Madama Butterfly,'' at the Lobero April 23, 25, 29 and May 1. Performances at 7:30 P.M., except 2:30 P.M. on April 25. Tickets: $38.50 and $48.50.,Sightseeing,The Santa Barbara Mission, the queen of the chain of religious outposts begun by Padre Junipero Serra, opened in 1786, two years after his death. Tucked into a hillside above town, the mission and its grounds offer a musty, mystical glimpse of life among the Spanish priests and their Chumash Indian converts. The church, at 2201 Laguna Street, is still active. Call (805) 682-4713 for information; tours are $3, with children free. Open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., but Sunday Masses mean no tours of the church until after 1:15 P.M.,In the heart of downtown, an architectural gem from a more modern era, the Santa Barbara County Courthouse, 1100 Anacapa Street, (805) 962-6464, is a great spot for getting oriented. The Spanish-Moorish structure, finished in 1929 as part of the rebuilding after a 1925 earthquake, helped set the style for much of downtown. Hand-painted ceilings, wrought-iron chandeliers and giant murals all capture the feeling of old California, and the 80-foot tower offers panoramas of the city and ocean. Open weekdays 8 A.M. to 4:45 P.M., weekends and holidays 10 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Free tours Monday to Saturday at 2 P.M.; Monday, Tuesday and Friday also at 10:30 A.M.,An excellent way to see Santa Barbara is by bicycle or the old-fashioned bicycle-surreys available for rent throughout downtown. At least one rental shop, Santa Barbara Beach Rentals, (805) 963-3700, will deliver bikes to your hotel, and many hotels either rent bikes or provide them free for guests.,One of the best of the many bike paths runs along the ocean from Montecito past the downtown beach front and up a gentle hill by the Santa Barbara City College campus to Shoreline Park. Another well-marked bike lane runs up State Street from the harbor to the mission, where you can follow ''Scenic Drive'' signs for the route that winds steeply along Alameda Padre Serra through the hills and back toward Montecito. Be prepared to pedal hard and watch for cars.,Unlike most California cities, Santa Barbara is also built for the sheer joy of strolling: one great pleasure is walking along State Street, with its El Paseo arcade, a charming example of 20's Spanish-style architecture; antiques stores and used-book shops line the side streets.,Exhibits at the Sea Center, 211 Stearns Wharf, (805) 962-0885, operated by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, are particularly suited to children. At the Touch Tank, they can handle fish, invertebrates and plants collected from local waters. Open October through May, Tuesday to Friday noon to 5 P.M.; Monday 11 A.M. to 2 P.M.; weekends and holidays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. (Touch Tank, noon to 4 P.M.); expanded summer hours. Admission, $3.,Where to Stay,The 71-room Santa Barbara Inn, 901 East Cabrillo Boulevard, (800) 231-0431, fax (805) 966-6584, is an old-fashioned beach-front motel with postmodern, Euro-tech aspirations. It's bright and cheery, but its proximity to the ocean and terrific restaurant, Citronelle, where breakfast is served for guests (not included in room rates), are the main draws here. Doubles: $159 to $219 for ocean view rooms with king bed.,The Montecito Inn, built by Charlie Chaplin, is a charming old roadside inn set just blocks back from the beach, at 1295 Coast Village Road in the heart of Montecito's upscale art galleries, cafes and shops. Because it abuts the 101 Freeway and railroad tracks, it can be a bit noisy, and its 60 old rooms and suites are smallish. But it has been lovingly restored with charm aplenty, plus a good restaurant and bar. Doubles from $185;  (800) 843-2017, fax (805) 969-0623.,Budget: A new 61-room Holiday Inn Express has just opened at 17 West Haley Street, in a former single-room-occupancy hotel, and offers the basic accommodations that chain is known for, within walking distance of downtown. Doubles: $119 to $159; (800) 549-1700, fax (805) 963-1747.,Just blocks from the beach downtown, the Country Inn by the Sea, 128 Castillo Street, is a charming vine-covered motel. The 47 rooms are done up in a European style, with chintzes and pine furnishings, some with canopied beds. Weekday doubles: $79 to $119, weekends $119 to $159, with Continental breakfast;  (805) 963-4471, fax (805) 962-2633.,Luxury: The Four Seasons Biltmore, 1260 Channel Drive, is a grande dame of coastal resorts. The summer headquarters for the senior staff of the Reagan White House, this sprawling compound facing the beach is formal but relaxed. Rooms  are in the main building and a series of cottages linked by winding, landscaped paths; La Marina, the formal restaurant, has topnotch food and spectacular views. The 217 rooms, in country Mediterranean style, range from $395 for doubles with garden views to $490, with fireplaces and ocean views; lower midweek rates sometimes available; (805) 969-2261,  fax (805) 565-8323.,The San Ysidro Ranch, 900 San Ysidro Lane, (800) 368-6788, fax (805) 565-1995, is an outpost of casual luxury and rustic elegance where Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh were married and John and Jacqueline Kennedy spent part of their honeymoon. The cottages have wood-burning stoves or fireplaces and are scattered through orange trees and flower beds, with another 400 acres left open for hikes or riding. Its 38  rooms are not cheap, $350 to $3,000, but the resort offers every amenity, from 24-hour room service to spa treatments.,Where to Eat,Citronelle, 901 East Cabrillo Boulevard, (805) 963-0111, Michel Richard's ocean-view restaurant, sets the culinary bar for Santa Barbara. Specialties include fresh blue-crab salad in an avocado nest and braised lamb shank with white beans and black olive sauce. We had an outstanding chef's tasting menu (which, at $70 a person with wine, is also an outstanding value) featuring baby salmon with gaufrette potatoes and roasted venison chop with black-currant sauce. Dinner for two is about $150, with wine from the ample list, which, like most restaurants here, features lots of Santa Ynez Valley selections.,You don't have to be a guest at the San Ysidro Ranch to eat at the Plow and Angel Bistro, 900 San Ysidro Lane, Montecito, (805) 969-4100. This cozy rathskeller with roaring fireplace is a great way to sample the resort's rarefied pleasures without the nightly tariff. You can order every item served in the fancier Stone House upstairs, like corn-crusted Pacific oysters, lemon-lime salmon and achiote-rubbed chicken. Dinner for two with modest wine: $150 (one-third that for bar fare).,The cozy Montecito Cafe, 1295 Coast Village Road, (805) 969-3392, is  always packed with local residents, who come for the Cal-American menu and reasonable prices on dishes like goat-cheese pancakes with salmon and caviar, and grilled chicken breast with Anaheim chilies, red onion, tomato and cream. Dinner for two with great local wine: $80.,You can take a seat at one of the picnic tables under the awning at La Super-Rica, 622 North Milpas Street, (805) 963-4940, and enjoy mouth-watering, freshly prepared Mexican food that keeps long lines stretched out the door at this famous taqueria,  blessed by Julia Child. There is no better place to sample rich and brothy pinto beans with bacon, delicate chiles rellenos or, Wednesday to Saturday, fresh tamales in light cream sauce. Huge lunch or dinner for two with beer, $20; cash only.,Right on the sand, Shoreline Cafe, 801 Shoreline Drive, (805) 568-0064, is a low-key hangout perfect for pancakes made with orange juice, or a grilled shark burrito or mussel pasta salad with a margarita at sunset. Breakfast, lunch or dinner: under $20 for two.",TODD S. PURDUM,"FEB. 28, 1999",WHAT'S DOING IN; Santa Barbara,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/travel/what-s-doing-in-santa-barbara.html
"WHAT sort of instruments would the musicians be playing at an American Classical Orchestra performance?,''If we were playing Bach's Brandenburg Concertos,'' said Thomas Crawford, ''there would be recorders instead of flutes, gambas in addition to cellos, always a harpsichord, a corno da caccia, a violino piccolo and an English horn-type instrument called a taille.'',For Beethoven's ''Emperor'' Piano Concerto, the main difference is the keyboard instrument. In Beethoven's day, it was a fortepiano. ''It's a totally different instrument,'' said Mr. Crawford. ''A modern piano has a metal frame and it sustains the tones far better. It has a loud pedal. Beethoven's piano had a pedal, but it was a wood frame and the sound was more incisive, percussive.'',In the 18th century the pianist was often in the middle of the orchestra, or even at the back. But the most profound contrast between a period performance and a modern one is that the soloist plays the entire concerto from start to finish. ''Beethoven would be playing along with the orchestra, every note in addition to the solo stuff,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''It's a matter of treating the soloist as part of the ensemble.'',Most modern performances have the pianist sitting patiently for the sometimes lengthy orchestral introduction to the piano's grand entrance. Typically this off and on participation of the soloist continues throughout the concerto. So the period performance is more visually dynamic and all-inclusive.,The instruments used today for an early music performance would be original or reproduction 18th century, with natural gut strings, woodwinds with fingerholes as opposed to keys and valveless brasses. Modern orchestras would double the size of the string section, which in Beethoven's day numbered around 18 violins, 4 violas, cellos and basses. There are still the same number of brasses and winds as the music specifies on a part.   VALERIE CRUICE",VALERIE CRUICE,"FEB. 28, 1999",What's Different?

Ms. O'Brien has produced more than 100 Shakespearean plays and introduced Shakespeare to 2,000 middle and high school students.,''She's a pied piper,'' Ms. Zambrano said. ''I had never acted before. She draws people to it -- the kids adore her.'' Ms. Zambrano remembers with affection what she calls a ''great, great experience.'' She can still say her lines, not by parroting them, but with the character motivation and underlying meaning of a play that Ms. O'Brien took the time to explain.,Dee O'Brien has been an English teacher at Hommocks Middle School since 1971.

He was examining me, and I was examining myself. I was excited about starting a relationship, but terrified that he was going to see right into me. There's not a whole lot of hiding when someone is looking so intently at you.''",,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Way We Live Now: 2.28.99; What They Were Thinking,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-2.28.99-what-they-were-thinking.html
"It was only a coincidence that I was reading Norman Podhoretz's new memoir, ''Ex-Friends,'' when Sidney Blumenthal and Christopher Hitchens started throwing affidavits at each other. Podhoretz's book is a crisp account of his years among the New York intellectuals in the 1960's, 70's and 80's. He relates how his ideological shift from left to right turned lively friendships -- with Lillian Hellman and Norman Mailer, among others -- into bitter relics. And when I thought of Sid and Hitch, as their friends (and I'm one) call them, possibly falling into that same politicized sand trap, it was hard not to feel a little sad. Although both have friends of a feather, each knows, I think, that a shared politics isn't a precondition of friendship. It can even be a complication.,Maybe it's because I'm a member of what Michael Lind once called the Generation of 1989 that I feel estranged from this kind of conflict. Since the end of the cold war, the consequences of disagreement seem so much less profound than they did in Podhoretz's heyday. So as ideology has seeped out of our politics, the chance of friendships despite politics seems greater. And so the fun that Podhoretz misses from his youth surely is more possible for my generation, and Hitch and Sid's grudge more arbitrary.,But beyond that, ending a friendship over politics calls into question how real the friendship was in the first place. True friendship, after all, often takes wing when you realize that you don't share another person's politics, but decide you like her anyway. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott once wrote that friendship consists in ''the absence of any desire to change or improve'' the other person. It contains at its core the freedom of disagreement, not the pressure to conform.,Most of my best friends, I find, are raving liberals. And we have a nice way of getting along. They playfully condescend to me and I playfully condescend to them. Then we talk about the latest episode of ''The PJ's.'' And some of my friends are archconservatives. We spend a few hours skating awkwardly around the Defense of Marriage Act and then order another beer.,When I think of my ''ex-friends,'' several categories come to mind. There are the exhausted friends, people who live too far away to keep in close touch with. There are the mistakes, who didn't hack it, or changed beyond recognition. Or ''phone fade-outs,'' who just stopped returning my calls. And then there are the handful of enemies, who behaved unspeakably and with whom it is sadly impossible to have any further contact at all.,But comrades turned traitors? Hardly any. Every now and again some issue comes along that seems to be life or death, and I catch a glimpse of those Pod-Hitch-Sid conniptions. I remember in the early 1990's, I was friends with a bunch of gay radicals in New York and a couple of closet cases in Washington. When the former group decided to ''out'' the latter, my post-ideological socializing broke down. I sided with the closet cases -- not because I knew them better, or admired them more, but because I found that the principle counted more than the relationship. But even then, the principle wasn't very abstract. I just found it hard to be friends with people, whatever their beliefs, who could act with what I thought was open-eyed cruelty.,One solution, perhaps, is for people who are passionate about politics to avoid passionately political friends. This is tricky in Washington, but even here, plenty of people can separate the personal from the political. Of my closest friends, one plays jazz piano for a living and one owns an animation company; another is a Jesuit in training and a fourth is a personal trainer. Their politics vary, but their personal center is located somewhere deeper than the latest editorial in The Nation or The Weekly Standard. Still, I wouldn't be any more likely to break with them if they were hard-line ideologues. And this isn't because I lack firm political convictions. It's because one of those convictions is that politics isn't life.,Another is that one of the points of a liberal democracy is to create and enlarge the private space where friendships breathe and grow. Friendship can exist anywhere, of course -- in neoconservative cabals, post-modern literary departments, army battalions. But it is purest when public regimentation recedes and private sensibility begins. And thus to saturate friendship with politics is to threaten its very nature, to subject it to a public realm to which it does not truly belong.,I think of George Orwell, whose recently published papers I've also been reading. He comes across as a man of deep conviction, but also fundamentally antisocial. He was never part of a set. His few friendships -- with Stephen Spender, for example -- seemed grounded in something deeper than solidarity. And this gave him a bravery that made him able to make public enemies, without making ex-friends. A useful trick that -- and one that Orwell made seem as effortless as his prose.",ANDREW SULLIVAN,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Way We Live Now: 2.28.99; Between Friends,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-2.28.99-between-friends.html
"Certainly there are invitations one must decline: pancakes with Pol Pot, a cookout in hell with Roy Cohn. But when this sanction is promiscuously applied -- like when members of Congress snub the State of the Union address -- it becomes more posturing than principle.,Shunning everyone with whom you disagree limits your options not only for dining but also for self-expression. Eartha Kitt shocked observers when she dined at the White House in 1968 -- and took the opportunity to criticize Lyndon Johnson for his Vietnam policy. But she was practicing democracy.,Your wife might enjoy that opportunity, but can you get her to the dinner? James Boswell faced a similar predicament in 1776 when he and Samuel Johnson were invited to dine alongside a man Johnson detested. ''If I had come upon him with a direct proposal, 'Sir, will you dine in company with Jack Wilkes?' he would have flown into a passion,'' Boswell wrote. Instead, he mentioned an invitation and merely hinted about objectionable company. Johnson replied: ''Do you think I am so ignorant of the world, as to imagine that I am to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table? . . . I am sorry to be angry with you; but really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever, occasionally.'' Only then did Boswell warn, ''I should not be surprised to find Jack Wilkes there.'' Having made a show of his worldliness, Johnson was trapped. ''And if Jack Wilkes should be there,'' he muttered, ''what is that to me sir?'' That evening Johnson was affable, witty and unambiguous in his opinions -- a delight to all the guests, including Wilkes.,Is attending the dinner an endorsement of another guest? The answer is: It depends on what you do when you get there. A successful dinner party requires lively conversation, not artificial consensus, so go, but speak your mind. And don't be seduced by the Wilkes seated beside you. Note that Johnson said ''occasionally.'',''Should Christ get a longer free ride than Santa Claus? I told my daughter (age 7) that Santa is a wonderful character invented by adults. She took it pretty well, and then she asked, 'Is Jesus just a character, too?' Should I really saddle her with my doubt on a subject that big?'',Contrary to the warning flashed before certain TV shows, all themes are suitable to a younger viewer: love and death, blood and terror, treachery and betrayal -- hence the enduring appeal of Grimms' fairy tales. But younger children not only accept a brief and general explanation, they prefer it.,Start by telling her what other people think. Some believe Jesus was a man who became a legend. Others believe every word about him. Tell her what you think, too, doubts and all.,Children live in a moral universe, and their questions deserve answers. When my Younger Viewer asked if the tooth fairy slipped that money under her pillow, I asked what she thought. She ventured that it was her parents. ''Do you really want me to tell you?'' I asked, giving her a chance to continue the fantasy. But when she demanded an answer, I gave it to her: The money is from our Lord and Saviour, Ernest Borgnine, whose face I just saw in a chef's salad at Denny's.",RANDY COHEN,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Way We Live Now: 2.28.99 -- The Ethicist; Dinner-Party Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-2.28.99-the-ethicist-dinner-party-politics.html
"Less than three months after tobacco companies raised the price of cigarettes by 45 cents a pack (to pay for their $206 billion settlement with the states), President Clinton has proposed an additional 55-cent levy. That could push the price of cigarettes to $4 or more in many parts of the country.,These Federal taxes are designed in part to discourage smoking, but the Government may have become just as dependent on tobacco as many smokers are. In New York City, where a pack of Marlboros can cost as much as $3.50 (depending on the retailer), Federal, state and city taxes account for $1.20. By way of comparison, the shocking sum of $883 million that states' lawyers will earn this year from tobacco settlements adds up to only 4 cents a pack. For its part, according to David Adelman, an industry analyst, Philip Morris pockets 28 cents a pack, after taxes, on Marlboros.,Despite all these added charges and legal hassles, of course, tobacco remains an extraordinarily profitable business. Which doesn't stop industry leaders from depicting themselves as victims -- along with the helpless consumers -- of the Government's taxation habits.

"Berg: In America, we create our own royalty. We give them fame and fortune and the latitude to do whatever they want to do, and in return, we claim the right to scrutinize them. That is part of the pleasure of having the hero for a lot of people. Charles Lindbergh was turned into a god against his will. But people after a few years began to look for flaws, and in fact he revealed some himself. For some people it was a great relief.,Echols: And Janis Joplin encouraged the plumbing and plundering of her own personal life. She was keenly aware of the public's desire for story after story of her flamboyant exploits and her underlying unhappiness. She even told a reporter for Rolling Stone that people like their blues singers miserable. She was very much attached to the idea that her audience was buying a whole package. And she demanded that the press cover it.,Advertising one's flaws can work in celebrities' favor, by establishing a kind of false intimacy. On the other hand, elusiveness can really feed fame -- which accounts for the public's fascination with Hillary Clinton. I mean, everybody wants to know what the hell she's thinking and feeling.,Berg: That's part of the reason the impeachment really went nowhere. It's not true that people have an insatiable appetite for gossip and misery. We only want to know so much.,Echols: Still, someone is going to write a killer biography of Clinton. There are just so many layers to him. What got to be a bore was his sexuality, which proved dreary and depressing. We want our celebrities to live large and have huge appetites. They should be miserable, but by God, when they have sex they should have fun. His stock would rise if he had an affair with a movie star.,Berg: Which raises the question that since there are no Marilyn Monroes and Bill Clinton is not J.F.K., has the coin of celebrity been devalued? Movie stars ain't what they used to be.,Echols: It also raises the question of whether certain flaws are more acceptable than others. We tend to forgive flaws we can accept in ourselves, flaws that can be attributed to something like low self-esteem.,Berg: That's right. Some celebrities revealing some flaws make us feel better. Others, such as Woody Allen, reveal something we don't want to know about human behavior.,Echols: It's more than that -- we want celebrities to be not just flawed but spectacularly flawed. It's a leveling impulse, but it's also a desire to elevate them. To see them have so many lovers, so many drugs, so much dysfunction. A few people seem to be immune to that impulse. Right now, Colin Powell is above scrutiny. Once he's dead, though, everyone's fair game. Also, when a rock star OD's. We have these moments of collective hand-wringing and fleeting contrition, but it doesn't last in the face of the great desire to know more, to know everything.,Berg: I saw that when I wrote my book. In some ways I feel that I shattered Lindbergh's image. I hear from people who were really disillusioned. Then again, a lot of people are angry that it isn't worse.,Echols: Yes, you see it in the way people respond to biographies -- the flaws are really part of the appeal. Part of what makes Janis Joplin such a great figure is here we have this girl who had acne, who had frizzy hair, and she made it, against all odds.,Berg: So she becomes a Scarlett O'Hara, and Charles Lindbergh becomes an Achilles. As time passes, some monuments from each period remain standing because they have come to symbolize the virtues and vices of an era. And what it all comes down to: they're really good stories. There is that to be said. We've been talking fancy all evening, but it really does boil down to who's got a good story.

"Q: Once the deal with At Home Network goes through, you'll be worth -- on paper, at least -- something like $51 million. Does extreme wealth look the way you might have imagined it would?,You know, it's funny. When you're a little kid, what do you think about when you think about millionaires? 'Cause you watch cartoons, or at least I did, you think they're supposed to live in big mansions with gates and stuff like that. I still live in a little one-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto. I still stay at work really late. I still go home to this apartment. I think the feeling of change comes in the little things.,Like what?,Like when the company was first starting up, we couldn't go out for dinner at all.,We had the 50-pound bags of rice and beans, and Taco Bell was sort of the treat. It's nice to be able to go out to dinner. I know that sounds trite. The major way my life has changed, honestly? I go out to dinner far more than I used to.,Why aren't you living that cartoon millionaire's life? Kicking back, counting your money?,I think that has to do with the way I'm wired. I'm extremely competitive, and extremely paranoid in the things I'm competing in. The indulgence that I've taken is that I went to Scottsdale, Ariz., to play golf. What's really interesting about Silicon Valley, and Excite in particular, is that it's so hard driving, it has a tendency not to celebrate. And I think that celebration is a key part of making sure that you stay sane.,So you bought yourself the right to celebrate?,Yeah. Exactly.,Are there other things you buy now that you didn't used to buy?,Hardback books. Yeah. My mom bought me the last two suits I had. I hadn't bought suits since junior year of college, or something like that, so they were pretty worn out. Then I got my dry cleaning and laundry confused and took my dry cleaning to one of those wash-and-fold places, so it shrank and shriveled. So, I'd say the other sort of nice thing is that I actually bought myself a reasonable suit. But I never wear it.,What about buying things for other people? Is that your secret outlet? Because you're doing a bad job of spoiling yourself.,I do have more than one digital camera, so I gave one to a friend, and I think he has since given it to a friend, so it's sort of the communal digital camera. It's great. Or I bought a Mazda Miata that's just sort of the communal car at the company. My dad and I were able to buy my sister a car for Christmas, which was a nice treat.,What if you truly wanted something that cost, say, $100,000, or if a close friend did -- could you just drop that kind of cash without thinking it over?,I'd say that's well above the threshold of an easy amount of money to think about spending. That's still a huge amount of money. What it comes down to is, when your money's in stock, and that fluctuates on a daily basis, it's counting chickens before they're hatched. So much of what's on the books in the Valley rises and falls based on factors that you can't control. That leads to a mentality that says you don't spend money until you have it because it's not locked in.,What about A.T.M. habits? Do you take out more cash? That's a very sensitive indicator.,The major change in habit has been getting one of those [debit] cards. Somehow that's actually been the major difference, only because I'm able to use that card far more frequently than I could before. And it's not a credit card; it's cash.,I can remember my days of trying to find an A.T.M. that would give me a five-dollar bill.,Exactly. I can definitely remember that.

"A specter is stalking world politics, as Karl Marx might have manifested it -- the specter of the third way.,''The third way is part of the politics of the center and center left,'' said Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, last month. ''In Britain, it means New Labor.'' He defined his third way as a place where ''economic dynamism and social justice can live together.'',''European Governments spend and tax heavily,'' noted Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chairman of the Clinton Council of Economic Advisers, ''but the architects of the new Europe see them as a human third way between old-style socialism and the supposed divisive social consequences of the American way.'',Her former boss saw the way more benignly. In Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, he said, ''I thought we ought to have a third way,'' and in his 1998 State of the Union declared, ''We have found a third way.'' Last month, he told the Economic Club of Detroit: ''We are working with business to use technology, research and market incentives to meet national goals. Some have called this political philosophy 'the third way.''',Those ''some'' can also be found in Moscow. ''Former Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov accused Moscow Mayor and born-again centrist Yuri Luzhkov of 'economic illiteracy,''' wrote Harry Kopp of the Jamestown Foundation's Monitor. ''Luzhkov, who recently returned from Tony Blair's Britain, said Russia must choose 'a third way between total socialism and vulgar liberalism.''',Where there's a way, there's a will; in this case, Will Marshall, head of Washington's Progressive Policy Institute, who says that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton ''think a third way approach to governing is his legacy.'',Of course, left and right take their pops at it. Liberals see self-contradictions in such a ''slippery center.'' ''The Third Way assumes a basic political symmetry,'' wrote Jonathan Chait in The New Republic, ''an unreconstructed left, a radical right and a Third Way nestled in between.'' But this is self-defeating: ''When the Third Way takes power, it alters that equation [and] no longer sits between the two poles of the political spectrum; it is the left pole. The calculus has changed, and, in order to retain the center, the Third Way must shift right again.'',The Republican Lamar Alexander, of the Campaign for a New American Century (its onset is getting ever more likely), slams the way from the right. ''The third way is no way,'' he claims. ''Supposedly, this is an alternative to free-market capitalism, on the one hand, and socialism on the other. When you peel the layers off this particular onion, however, what you get is 'social democracy' -- the ever-expanding, cradle-to-grave welfare-state programs that hobble most European countries.'',Where did the latest moniker for the middle of the road come from? You can find the phrase in theology (between the second and fourth ways of St. Thomas Aquinas) and among the ways of phenomenology. In politics, the historian H.A.L. Fisher traced it to the French emperor Napoleon III, who steered between internal revolution and foreign war to choose a third way of liberalism. In the United States, early centrists working toward a third party between Federalists and Republicans were called Quiddists, from the Latin tertium quid, or ''third thing.'',Hotspur!,''He must find a way out among moderate Republicans and Democrats,'' the Times editorialist wrote of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, ''even if Republican hotspurs object.'',Every dictionary worth its spurs notes that the word hotspur was the sobriquet of Sir Henry Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland, killed in 1403 in the rebellion against Henry IV. (A sobriquet is a descriptive appellation, like Gov. Jesse [the Body] Ventura, which geezers will fondly recall followed, by two generations, Marie [the Body] McDonald.) The earliest citation of hotspur was in a chronicle a half-century later: ''Herry Percy the yonger, whom the Scottis clepid Herry Hatspore.'' Shakespeare then used the word in his ''Henry IV'': ''A haire-brained Hotspurre, gouern'd by a Spleene.'',Tangent time: those citations show us (1) that Henry led to Harry by way of Herry, or Herry was the progenitor of both, and (2) that the Shakespearean spelling of haire-brained is a source of the confusion about that word's meaning. It has nothing to do with hair found on the scalp on top of the skull that encases the brain. Rather, it is a hare, or rabbit, which was thought to have an especially small or weak brain. End of tangent.,But what is the metaphoric basis of hotspur? Why not coldspur or hotsaddle (as in the discomforting title of the Mel Brooks movie ''Blazing Saddles'')? When an equestrian rides impetuously or cruelly, spurring his horse constantly, the spurs are seen to become hot from the friction -- if not literally, at least figuratively. That's what harebrained Henry (not haire-brained Herry) did, and why they clepid, or yclept, or named him that.

If he is lucky and wealthy, he may be able to find an accredited modern dentist. If he is like most Cambodians, however, he'll try a home remedy (like a pinch of salt or monosodium glutamate) and hope the pain goes away. And when it doesn't, he can always ask a faith healer to blow a burst of magic air into his mouth.,Among so many other things, dentists -- and thereby dental care -- were virtually eliminated by the Khmer Rouge during their four-year reign of terror. Today, children are taught by teachers without high-school degrees; courts answer to the whim of judges who didn't attend law school; and the sick often hang life-size straw effigies to ward off the spirits of disease. The country's only dental school has produced fewer than 70 graduates in the five years since it began issuing diplomas.,As a result, local practitioners like Sok Eng, 31 -- who lives in a village in Kandal Province, south of Phnom Penh -- qualify as experts. Ten of her 12 brothers and sisters are dentists, all trained by their father, who was, in turn, trained by his father.,Her rusting dental chair and pedal-run drill constitute the main furniture of her cement-floored, tin-roofed home. A peeling sign outside displays a menacing, disembodied set of teeth. The other day, three patients waited on plastic chairs, chatting with Sok Eng as she drilled away on a fourth patient. Sok Eng's small daughter examined her own teeth in a mirror. One patient had come to repair a broken tooth; one was receiving arsenic treatments to kill a nerve; one had come, in her own words, ''to pull some out and put some in.'' Local anesthetic is available, but only for emergencies.,A filling costs just $2.50. A crown is $10. For many rural Cambodians, though, even these prices are too steep. Remote villages are served by itinerant barbers who make the circuit of the rice fields on bicycles or motorbikes carrying a bag of all-purpose tools and cutting hair or pulling teeth as needed.,Others tolerate chronic discomfort as just one more of life's hardships. ''For the Khmer, it is no problem, a little pain,'' said Philippe Guibert, a French dental technician at the European Dental Clinic in the capital. ''For me, if I had this, I'd go crazy.''",SETH MYDANS,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Way We Live Now: 2.28.99 -- How it's done in Cambodia; The Magic-Air Cure,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-2.28.99-how-it-s-done-in-cambodia-the-magic-air-cure.html
"New Jersey's water seems to be a fountain of trouble.,In Trenton last week, legislators introduced a measure to pay for filtering systems for two wells that serve Toms River. The $1.5 million project, promised by Governor Whitman, is intended to safeguard the water from chemicals that were found, once, in one of the wells, but are no longer present.,The chemicals -- trichloroethylene, a probable carcinogen, and styrene acrylonitrile trimer, whose effect on the human body is not known -- appeared in one of the wells after excessive removals drew in traces of a plume of residue from a Union Carbide Superfund site. The filters are to be built in addition to a Federal directive that Union Carbide insure that the local water company, United Water Toms River, not draw excessively from wells in the area.,Gerald Nicholls, director of environmental safety, health and analytical programs with the state Department of Environmental Protection, acknowledged that the filtration will be largely redundant. He said, however, ''Through intent or error, it will still be at least remotely possible to pull the plume into the wells.'',But some officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ''belt and suspenders'' approach had more to do with trying to assuage fears over the state's water supply than with demonstrated need.,Since 1979, cancer has been diagnosed in 102 children in and around Toms River, about 30 percent higher than would be expected for the area, Dover Township. Some suspicions fell on the water supply because the area's six wells are near two Superfund sites.,Sixty families there recently hired Jan Schlichtmann, the lawyer portrayed in the film ''A Civil Action,'' to represent them in negotiations with the companies involved in the Superfund sites, Union Carbide and Ciba-Geigy.,Mr. Schlichtmann was in attendance on Monday when Senator Frank R. Lautenberg announced he would introduce Federal legislation that will increase the scope of a program requiring water companies to send clients comprehensive water-quality reports, beginning this fall.,Toms River is not the only focus of concern. The state is testing eight other public water supplies around the state, for a total of more than 20 wells, for similar contamination, said Leslie McGeorge, the director of the department's Division of Science and Research.,And over the last year, reports from the state division of the United States Geological Survey, the state Department of Environmental Protection and Gloucester County have warned that some samples of water drawn from the state's shallowest aquifer, the Kirkwood-Cohansey, have shown levels of radium and mercury that exceed Federal standards for safety.,The aquifer serves much of south Jersey, and only municipal supplies are currently required to be tested. As many as 500,000 people use private wells that draw from the aquifer, and the state has repeatedly urged that owners have such wells tested.,Mercury, notoriously toxic in an organic compound known as methyl mercury, has been found in the aquifer in an inorganic form that is much less dangerous.,Last fall, the department ordered nine water suppliers, seven of which draw from the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer, to reduce radium levels, and testing continues throughout the state.,Last week, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that some environmentalists said the state's standards on radium were too lax. The state uses the Federal Environmental Protection standards of 5 picocuries per liter, a measurement that places a person's risk of cancer at 1 in 10,000 after 70 years of drinking two liters of water a day.,Dave Pringle, the campaign director for the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said the state should use the standard it applies to volatile organic contaminants, like benzene. That risk level is 1 in 1 million after the same exposure.,But Ms. McGeorge and Mr. Nicholls said no practical method existed for testing for radium at that level. And other scientists noted that vast treatment systems would create a new problem: concentrated radioactive waste.",ANDREA KANNAPELL,"FEB. 28, 1999",Water Worries Produce Legislation,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/water-worries-produce-legislation.html
"Every 20 seconds, someone in America is arrested for a drug violation. Every week, on average, a new jail or prison is built to lock up more people in the world's largest penal system.,It was not always so. Ten years ago, half as many people were arrested for drug crimes, and the nation's incarceration rate was closer to those of other democracies. But in the 1980's crack cocaine scared the country, and the criminal justice system has never been the same.,Crack poisoned many communities. Dealers turned neighborhoods into drug markets. As heavily armed gangs fought over turf, murder rates shot up. Authorities warned that crack was instantly addictive and spreading rapidly, and predicted that a generation of crack babies would bear the drug's imprint. It looked like a nightmare with no end.,But for all the havoc wreaked by crack, the worst fears were not realized. Crack appealed mainly to hard-core drug users. The number of crack users began falling not long after surveys began counting them. A decade later, the violence of the crack trade has burned out, and murder rates have plunged.,Yet crack left its mark, in ways that few people anticipated. Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws, lock up a record number of people and shift money from schools to prisons. It transformed police work, hospitals, parental rights, courts.,Crack also changed the racial makeup of American prisons. More whites than blacks use crack, according to surveys, but as the war on drugs focused on poor city neighborhoods, blacks went to prison at a far higher rate. Here in California, five black men are behind bars for each one in a state university.,But the harsh laws responding to crack have not reduced overall drug use. And now the ceaseless march of new drug offenders and the mounting costs of prisons are moving some of the people charged with enforcing the punitive laws to question the assumptions behind them.,''We have a failed social policy and it has to be re-evaluated,'' said Barry R. McCaffrey, the four-star general who heads the National Drug Control Policy Office. ''Otherwise, we're going to bankrupt ourselves. Because we can't incarcerate our way out of this problem.'',More than a quarter-million Americans in prison for drug offenses could be better dealt with in treatment programs, he said, saving up to $5 billion a year.,Since 1985 the nation's jail and prison population has grown 130 percent, and it will soon pass two million, even as crime rates continue a six-year decline. No country has more people behind bars, and only one, Russia, has a higher incarceration rate, according to the Sentencing Project, which tracks prison rates.,Behind the increase is a national get-tough mood that has produced longer sentences for all criminals and the end of parole in many states. Polls show that most Americans favor lengthy terms for violent criminals.,But perhaps the biggest single factor is the systematic jailing of drug offenders. In the first 10 years after Congress toughened drug laws in response to crack, the number of people imprisoned for drugs grew more than 400 percent, nearly twice the growth rate for violent criminals. More people are behind bars for drug offenses in the United States -- about 400,000 -- than are in prison for all crimes in England, France, Germany and Japan combined.,Crack's legacy can be seen in nearly every corner of the land, even here in the Mojave Desert, where the newest Federal prison is rising at the dusty edge of Victorville. In an age of Government downsizing, the Federal corrections budget has grown more than tenfold in a decade, to nearly $4 billion, yet prisons are so stuffed with drug offenders that this one will be at capacity almost from the day it opens.,Some experts argue what might seem obvious: that high incarceration rates deserve the credit for falling crime rates.,''Putting people in prison has been the single most important thing we've done to reduce crime,'' Dr. James Q. Wilson, the political scientist whose ideas have influenced police departments for a generation, has written.,In New York, the police and prosecutors say locking up thousands of drug offenders was a major factor in the city's turning the corner on crime. ''What plays havoc with a neighborhood are the low-level dealers,'' said Bridget Brennan, the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for New York. ''When they take over a street or a stoop, everyone else is terrified. When you put those people in jail, it gives the community a sense that order has been restored.'',What the prison boom has not done, however, is reduce illicit drug use, national surveys show. Many fewer Americans use illegal drugs now than in the peak years of the 1970's. But almost all of the drop occurred before crack cocaine or the laws passed in response to it.,The most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, for 1997, estimated that about 14 million people had used an illegal drug in the last month, a number barely changed since 1988. Of those, 600,000 had smoked crack within a month, unchanged since 1988. But during that time, imprisonment rates soared.,''What's happened across the board is that police started going after small-time street dealers and users,'' said Dr. Steven Belenko, a criminologist at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.,Crack never became a mainstream drug, but the fear of it changed perception and laws for virtually all illicit drugs, according to Mr. Belenko and others who have studied the war on drugs.,''Crack probably had more impact on the entire criminal justice system than it had on the communities and the drug users,'' said Dr. Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California School of Law. ''This secondary impact, on police and prisons, may end up being more negative than anything associated with the drug.'',Among governors, teachers, criminologists and police chiefs, there is vigorous debate over how the drug laws enacted at the height of the crack panic have transformed the nation. But in Congress, which enacted the laws without a single hearing, there is nothing. For crack has left one other major legacy: The policy discussion in Washington on prisons and drugs has been frozen for more than a decade.,The Evidence,As Crime Rate Falls, More Prisons Are Built,The little towns tucked into the folds of the Appalachian Mountains in Schuylkill County, Pa., are a world removed from the city streets where crack cocaine was a media obsession in the mid-1980's. But the legacy of crack is all around.,A first-year teacher there can expect to make $18,500 a year, the state-mandated minimum. A prison guard trainee is paid $22,300. The job of watching over the drug offenders and others who are filling three new state prisons in the region is coveted.,Pennsylvania might not seem the kind of place where prisons and jails would be booming. The state has an aging population. Crime has never been a particularly big problem; among the states, Pennsylvania has ranked near the bottom. But every year for the last 14 years, Pennsylvania has added at least one prison, and the corrections budget has soared to more than $1 billion a year, a fivefold increase over a decade.,In 1988, not long before President George Bush spoke to the nation about the war on drugs while holding up a bag of crack, Pennsylvania radically changed its drug laws, establishing mandatory minimum sentences for people caught with illicit drugs. No time off for first-time offenders. No community service. No treatment for addicts.,Pennsylvania was following the lead of Congress, which had set the nation on a course of strict incarceration for drug users with laws enacted in 1986 and 1988. Ten years later, its inmate population had grown 225 percent, to 35,600. Pennsylvania spends an average of $20,000 a year for each one, about the national average.,Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, has no plans to change the incarceration policy. ''Every public expenditure comes with a choice,'' said his spokesman, Tim Reeves. ''We defend the choices we've made.'',The crime rate might not be so low if the state had not locked up so many drug offenders, Mr. Reeves said. ''What would the rate be if those guys were not in jail?'' he said. ''Think about the cost to the community, the wasted lives and violent crime.'',But in building a penal system in which 3 of every 10 new prisoners are serving time for drugs, according to the Pennsylvania Sentencing Commission, which tracks prison rates for the state, Pennsylvania, like most states, has not reduced illegal drug use.,''I don't think anybody believes it has turned out to be an effective policy,'' said David Sweet, a Harrisburg lawyer who headed a special commission that examined the state's prison growth. ''It appeared to us that we were using a very expensive way to provide secure housing for people who probably don't belong in prison.'',Dr. Julia Glover Hall, a criminologist at Drexel University and president of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, which Benjamin Franklin established to monitor prisons and jails, said: ''It's a stupid game we're playing. We're locking up all these nonviolent offenders, pouring money down a rat hole.'',She added: ''I've been a crime victim. I'm not soft on criminals. But we have to look at the bottom line of what we're doing. There was this powerful scare in the crack years, and all across the country we passed these Draconian laws. Now we're starting to see how much it has cost the rest of us.'',Pennsylvania is typical of what has happened across the country. California is spending nearly $4 billion a year to operate the nation's largest prison system. As the state added 21 prisons since 1984 -- and only one university campus -- violent criminals fell to 42 percent of the prison population in 1997, from 57 percent, while drug inmates grew to 27 percent, from 8 percent.,Political leaders have debated whether the building boom was at the expense of their budget's other big discretionary item, higher education. Many politicians said the state would try to fully finance both. But the numbers tell another story.,Spending on prisons has grown 60 percent over a decade, and pay for prison guards has more than doubled. For higher education, there was virtually no growth, and salaries in the state university system stagnated, falling behind other states. A prison guard now makes about $51,000 a year, while a first-year professor in California's once-vaunted university system is paid $41,000.,As the prison budget swelled, California raised tuition to make up the university financing gap. Over the last 10 years, as the state's population grew by 5 million people, state university enrollment fell 20,000.,The shift in priorities, documented in a number of studies, has become a major issue since a new Governor, Gray Davis, and a new Legislature took office.,''Most of our buildings are literally falling apart and we've lost 1,500 full-time faculty members,'' said Jeri Bledsoe, general manager of the California Faculty Association. ''You bet there's been a price to pay for our prison boom.'',The Convicted,$40 Worth of Cocaine Brings a Life Sentence,The biggest legacy of crack is out of sight, behind the concrete and steel of prisons. Addicts, couriers, girlfriends of dealers, people tempted by the lure of a quick buck, mostly poor blacks -- these are the dominant profiles of the people jailed since prisons started filling with drug criminals.,Inside the maximum-security unit at the state prison for women in Topeka, Kan., Gloria L. Van Winkle is in the sixth year of a life term for possessing $40 worth of cocaine. A mother of two and a drug addict, she had two convictions for cocaine possession when a convicted thief told undercover agents she was smoking crack and they set up a sting.,Kansas has all but forgotten about Ms. Van Winkle. Asked about her case, the state Sentencing Commission said no one was doing life for drug possession. ''Only murderers get life sentences in Kansas,'' said its executive director, Barbara Tombs.,On further review, Ms. Tombs found that, yes, for a brief period in the early 90's, a person convicted of three drug offenses could get life. That law was changed. Ms. Van Winkle's sentence was not.,''I can't laugh anymore, I can't cry -- it's just a slow rage that makes me numb,'' Ms. Van Winkle said. Her sentence offers an eventual chance of parole, but for now, she lives for visits from her children, ages 10 and 6, and wonders what they will grow up to be like with her behind bars.,Her concern is shared by many others: Three-fourths of the 54,000 women jailed for drug crimes have children.,The police and prosecutors said Ms. Van Winkle should have been aware of the possibility of a life sentence. They said she was chosen because they thought she might lead them to dealers, but no follow-up arrests were made.,Ms. Van Winkle's case is rare but not unique. Because of three-strikes laws and other changes made in the last decade, people in at least six other states are serving life sentences for drug possession. More typical among women convicted of drug offenses are 5- and 10-year mandatory terms.,Tonya Drake, a mother of four, had no criminal record or history of drug use when she was sentenced to 10 years in Federal prison for mailing a package that contained crack cocaine. She says a friend paid her $44 to mail the package, which she did not know contained drugs.,Ms. Drake admits what she did was wrong. ''But the time does not fit the crime,'' she said in a prison interview. ''You lock me up for 10 years. While I'm here, my father dies, my children grow up, it cost thousands of dollars to keep me behind bars.'',The children are having considerable trouble growing up with their mother in prison, said Ms. Drake's sister, Williet Mitchell. ''Tonya was taken away from the kids at a time when everybody needed her,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''Now the kids are screwed up. They're angry and bitter that she was forced to leave them.'',When the children see their mother in the prison visiting room, Ms. Drake tries to explain what brought her there. ''I tell my kids I did something wrong, that it was a mistake,'' she said. ''But it was my first and only mistake.'',In Kentucky, Louie Cordell, a 55-year-old father of nine with no prior convictions, is finishing a mandatory five-year Federal sentence for growing 141 marijuana plants.,Mr. Cordell was sent to prison under the 1986 law that set mandatory 5- and 10-year sentences for the possession or sale of small amounts of crack. For marijuana, the law set a mandatory sentence of 5 years for possession of 100 plants, whether they were seedlings or 6 feet tall. That provision has since been changed to go by weight.,The law punished Mr. Cordell, but it hit his family just as hard. He worked seasonally at a sawmill in a poor county in southeastern Kentucky and was growing the marijuana to help make ends meet, said his wife, Shirley.,Since Mr. Cordell went to prison, a son gave up plans to attend college on a scholarship in order to help support the family, and the Cordells have been on and off welfare.,''There's no way to describe what's happened to us except to say that it's been bad in all ways,'' Mrs. Cordell said. ''Louie was here providing for us and then they took him away. I expected him to get some time for what he did, but not five years.'',Marijuana was never mentioned in the floor speeches in Congress when the drug laws were rewritten in 1986, but the new penalties for crack were accompanied by harsher sentences for most drugs. Ten years later, more people were sentenced under the Federal system for marijuana than for any other drug.,Supporters of harsh penalties argue that locking up the Louie Cordells of the world has a deterrent effect and say convictions reduce other crimes associated with drug use.,Marijuana arrests set a record in 1997 -- 695,200, nearly 90 percent of which were for simple possession. And marijuana remains, by far, the most popular illegal drug: 18 million Americans used marijuana at least once in 1997, according to the National Household Survey. And some 71 million, 33 percent of those over age 12, have used marijuana at some time.,Asked about deterrence, the Federal prosecutor in Mr. Cordell's case, David Marye, said marijuana cultivation does not seem to have diminished in rural Kentucky.,''I've been prosecuting cases, state and Federal, for 21 years, and we have so many people who keep doing what Louie Cordell was doing that it makes you wonder if we'll ever stop them,'' he said.,The Cities,Racial Implications Of the Crack Laws,One of every 20 Americans born this year will serve time in prison, according to a Justice Department study. For blacks, the projection is 1 in 4. By 1996, 8.3 percent of black men age 25 to 29 were inmates, compared with 0.8 percent of white men that age.,The odds of going to prison used to be more even. But the criminal justice system's special treatment of crack cocaine dramatically threw off the balance, according to reports by the Sentencing Commission and the Justice Department.,For people convicted of a crack offense, the world of justice is unlike any other. Crack is simply cocaine processed so that it can be smoked. But Federal law equates 5 grams of crack with 500 grams of powder cocaine, a 1-to-100 ratio that no other country recognizes. Possessing 5 grams of crack is a felony with an automatic five-year prison term, while 5 grams of the same drug in powder form is a misdemeanor likely to carry no jail time.,One consequence of the disparity is that kingpins at the top of a drug network who sell pounds of powder cocaine for processing often serve less time than street-level dealers who sell grams of crack.,''One of the great victims of the drug war is that our sense of penal proportion has been thrown out,'' said Professor Zimring, of the University of California School of Law. ''Now we have a fairness problem.'',In addition, a law aimed at one type of drug use has been applied most often against one type of user -- urban blacks.,A higher percentage of blacks use crack cocaine than whites or Hispanic people. But in absolute numbers, twice as many whites as blacks use crack, and three times as many whites as blacks use powder cocaine, the national household survey shows.,As the war on drugs set up special penalties on crack, however, law enforcement focused on the highly visible, often violent crack trade in city neighborhoods, rather than the larger traffic in cocaine going on behind closed doors across the country. The result: Nearly 90 percent of the people locked up for crack under Federal drug laws are black, General McCaffrey said.,In state prisons, blacks make up nearly 60 percent of the people serving time on drug offenses, according to Justice Department figures, though they are only 12 percent of the general population and 15 percent of regular drug users.,''I don't think we got into this fix because of racism,'' General McCaffrey said. ''The impact of crack on the African-American community was devastating. And that's where enforcement has been concentrated.'',The racial disparity would disappear if the law treated the powder and crack form of cocaine equally, said Dr. Douglas C. McDonald, a senior scientist at Abt Associates, a social policy research group in Cambridge, Mass., who testified before Congress. If enforcement were evenly applied, more whites than blacks would go to prison, he said.,So, for many blacks the legacy of crack is not just the violence and high prison rates that have hit so many communities, but a heightened sense that the law does not treat them fairly.,''You have so many people who feel hopeless, who feel that it is extremely unfair that so many low-level offenders are going to jail for such a long time,'' said Mattie Compton, a black community leader in Fort Worth, Tex., who is deputy chief assistant United States attorney for the civil division.,''We know we're going to lose people in poor neighborhoods, but when you see people who are prospects for future leaders going away to jail for so long, you wonder if we really are a community under siege,'' Ms. Compton said.,Asked about the legacy of crack in the Roxbury district of Boston, where he works with drug addicts at a community health center, Seward Hunter said: ''If you're African-American, you expect to be targeted by the police and you expect to be stopped and searched.'',Many in Congress say there is no racial intent behind the crack and powder disparity. Crack is punished more severely because of its harm and because of the violent crimes associated with it.,''No one should forget that crack traffickers deal in death, and that they do so to the most vulnerable among us, the residents of our inner cities,'' said Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime.,The Change,Crack Makes News; Congress Responds,How Congress came to write a law that allows a person caught with 400 grams of powder cocaine, worth some $40,000, to do less than a year in jail, while a person holding the same amount of cocaine in crack form will spend 10 years in prison, is a mystery to people who have tried to research the statutory intent.,One lawyer who was instrumental in rewriting the drug laws in 1986 and 1988 says it came about through whim and attempts by politicians to one-up each other as crack seized headlines just before elections.,''There was a level of hysteria that led to a total breakdown of the legislative process,'' said the lawyer, Eric Sterling, who as a lead lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee wrote the laws that established long mandatory terms for several drugs. Since leaving the Judiciary Committee in 1989, Mr. Sterling has worked to overturn the laws as president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in Washington.,In the summer of 1986, crack was just starting to be labeled as an epidemic when a college basketball star, Len Bias, died of a drug overdose, reportedly crack cocaine. Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., whose hometown team, the Boston Celtics, had drafted Mr. Bias, ordered an overhaul of Federal drug laws. The death of Mr. Bias was invoked in Congress 11 times.,The law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, passed the House with only 16 dissenting votes. Despite complaints by some Senators that no one had studied the bill, it sailed through the Senate and President Ronald Reagan signed it before Election Day.,A year later, court testimony revealed that Mr. Bias died of an overdose of powder cocaine, not crack. But by then crack had its special status in state and Federal law.,Crack was singled out for good reason, according to Edwin Meese 3d, the Attorney General in the mid-1980's and now the Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow of Public Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington.,''Crack cocaine was the scourge of the inner city,'' he said. ''The reason laws were changed was to protect the inner city.'',In 1988, Congress passed another overhaul of drug laws just before the election, singling out crack as the only drug to carry a mandatory five-year prison term for possession.,That year, a Gallup poll found that 62 percent of Americans surveyed agreed that to curb drug use they ''would be willing to give up some freedoms.'',Crack was on the cover of news magazines, dominated television and newspaper coverage, and was labeled ''America's drug of choice,'' by NBC. The New York Times reported that it was spreading to the suburbs. William J. Bennett, the drug czar for 18 months under President Bush, said it might soon invade every home in America. Crack was compared to the bubonic plague and called ''the most addictive drug known to man'' in Newsweek.,Today, few of the revisionist experts on drug laws dispute crack's link to violence and gangs. ''It was a nightmare,'' General McCaffrey said. ''It was World War III.'',But crack was never America's drug of choice -- it did not come close. At the height of concern in the late 1980's, the National Household Survey on Drugs estimated that less than one-half of 1 percent of the population over age 12 used crack once a month, while 10 percent used marijuana. And 3 out of 4 high school seniors who tried crack did not continue to use it, according to a national survey of students by the University of Michigan.,Both surveys have flaws, underestimating inner-city users and high school dropouts. But, even after adjusting the findings for high use in certain urban areas, crack was never the epidemic it was held up to be.,The media attention was so hyperbolic that the Drug Enforcement Administration was compelled to correct the record. ''Crack is currently the subject of considerable media attention,'' the agency said in 1986. ''The result has been a distortion of the public perception of the extent of crack use as compared to the use of other drugs.'',Although crack was labeled the world's most addictive drug, 10 years of national surveys have shown that most people who try crack do not continue to use it.,Because of its intense but short-lived effect, crack does tend to make its users ''psychologically dependent,'' reported a Justice Department study. But numerous studies have shown that crack, like the powder form of cocaine, may be less physically addictive than alcohol or tobacco.,The Pyramid,Lower Level Dealers Feel the Sting of Laws,Political leaders said harsh sentencing laws were intended to deter use of the most dangerous drugs, with crack at the top of the list. Failing that, they said, the laws would at least go after drug kingpins. But statistics show a different pattern among people sentenced to prison for drugs since 1986.,Of the people jailed for crack by the Federal Government, only 5 percent were considered high-level dealers, according to a study by the Sentencing Commission.,''The current policy focuses law-enforcement efforts on the lowest level of the distribution line, the street level dealer,'' the commission's vice chairman, Michael S. Gelacak, wrote. ''Unless we ignore all evidence to the contrary, the current policy has little or no impact upon the drug abuse problem. The jails are full.'',Supporters of the crack laws say the numbers are explained by the pyramid structure of drug operations; by nature they have few people at the top, lots of people at the bottom.,But those at the top are often dealing powder cocaine, with its vastly different penalties. And they are in a position to become informers, the only real hope of beating a mandatory prison term.,Had Tonya Drake, the woman serving 10 years for mailing a package, been able to supply what the law labels ''substantial assistance'' -- information on a high-level dealer -- she might have reduced her sentence. The 1980's drug laws leave discretion in the hands of prosecutors to encourage people to ''snitch.'',Ms. Drake identified the man who gave her the package, but he was never found. The prosecutor decided her assistance was not substantial. The fixed sentences have infuriated judges, who say they feel their role has been reduced to that of rubber stamps for prosecutors, while their courts are clogged with low- to medium-level drug offenders.,''When you're dealing with first-time offenders, you should have some discretion,'' said Lawrence Irving, a former Federal judge from San Diego. ''I had cases where I was forced to give more jail time for low-level offenders than for the kingpins. It made no sense.'',In a 1994 case in Chicago, Marvin E. Aspen, a Federal District Court judge, labeled his sentencings ''a farce'' as he sent the lowest and ''least culpable'' member of a big crack operation to prison for longer than a supplier at the top.,Monica Boguille, the 20-year-old mother of a baby girl, was sentenced to 10 years for occasionally counting money for her boyfriend, a crack dealer. L. C. Godfrey, one of the ring's wholesale suppliers of cocaine, who was deemed helpful to prosecutors, received 9 years.,Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court said recently that Federal judges should regain some of the discretion they once had. Five years ago, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made similar points in condemning the mandatory minimum sentences established by Congress.,Dozens of Federal judges, most of them former prosecutors, have taken a strong stand against mandatory minimum drug sentences. For these judges, the most significant legacy of crack is a legal system that has left them as little more than spectators in their own courtrooms.,The Aftermath,The Penalties Outlive Fear of an Epidemic,General McCaffrey says he came to the drug debate with an open mind but has become convinced that current policies, with the primary emphasis on imprisonment, are failing. ''The current system is bad drug policy and bad law enforcement,'' he said.,On cost alone, arresting, prosecuting and locking up all drug criminals at the price of about $35 billion a year is not effective, he said. He now favors long sentences for dealers and treatment for low-level users.,A recent study by the Rand Corporation concluded that mandatory jail terms are the least cost-effective way of reducing cocaine consumption. For violent crimes, long sentences keep criminals off the street, it reported, but for drug crimes, ''a jailed supplier is often replaced by another supplier.'',Drug treatment also has a low success rate; among regular users of cocaine who undergo treatment, only 1 in 8 stop. But even that would achieve a greater reduction in cocaine use, at a fraction of the cost, than prison, the Rand study stated.,''We misread a lot what was going on in the 1980's, in that we thought crack use was going to grow and take over society,'' said Dr. Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who conducted the study. ''The real tragedy is that, now that it's clear that crack was not the epidemic it was supposed to be, we still have these laws.'',But few authorities on crime expect the laws to change, no matter how full the prisons become. ''For politicians, the drug debate is driven by the three R's -- retribution, revenge, retaliation -- and that leads to the fourth R, re-election,'' said Dr. James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University.,This month, the Clinton Administration announced a plan to cut drug use in half by 2007. After years of reduced Federal financing for drug rehabilitation, it would increase money for treating addicts.,The war metaphor has been dropped by the White House, and by some in Congress as well. But the emphasis on long mandatory prison terms and locking up small-time dealers remains the main strategy for Congress.,''I believe it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the war on drugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all Americans, and our children in particular, that the sale of illegal drugs is dangerous, wrong and will not be tolerated,'' said Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.,Senator Abraham has introduced a bill that would establish much longer sentences for people convicted of powder cocaine offenses, making them closer to crack.,''All that bill would do is lock up a bigger batch of small fry,'' said Julie Stewart, a former member of the conservative Cato Institute, who founded Families Against Mandatory Minimums after her brother was sent to prison on a marijuana conviction. The group has 37,000 members.,But with polls showing that most Americans favor long prison terms for drug trafficking, attempts to persuade Congress to reconsider the laws have gone nowhere. Sentiment has remained the same for nearly a decade, dating to a time when some politicians predicted that America could be drug-free by the year 2000. Nobody makes such a prediction these days.,NEXT: The police arm themselves for the war on drugs.",TIMOTHY EGAN,"FEB. 28, 1999","War on Crack Retreats, Still Taking Prisoners",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/war-on-crack-retreats-still-taking-prisoners.html

"WHEN people describe James Waring Koven, the word colossal comes up over and over. A member of the United States men's national rowing team and the 1997 world champion in men's single sculls, he has colossal lungs, friends say, and always eats colossal meals. He travels with a gigantic duffel bag, which his teammates call the Blob. It holds everything from sweat pants to novels to Powerbars.,''The Blob grows to sizes beyond compare,'' said Fred Honebein, a fellow rower. ''You don't look into the Blob. It's like looking into the sun. You'll go blind.'',Sam Caspersen, a childhood friend, added that Mr. Koven has always had a colossal build. ''In eighth grade he was six feet, 175 pounds, extremely strong.'',Mr. Koven, now 25, lives in Cambridge, Mass., and is training for next year's Olympics. He trains every morning, goes to work as a corporate finance analyst at the State Street Capital Corporation in Boston and then returns to practice again. Like many rowers, he's a perfectionist with a high threshold for pain. Friends says he's also a sentimentalist who cries openly when he's moved.,Five years ago he met Sophia Emily Coquillette at a party given by mutual friends. ''My heart was just racing,'' Mr. Koven remembered. ''I couldn't even think straight. It was a very powerful encounter.'',Ms. Coquillette, 24, is a project analyst at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, a Boston law firm. Like Mr. Koven, she is known for being both emotional and hard-working. ''I remember her with glasses on her face, books on the table and a cup of tea,'' said Brook Gomez, who shared a dormitory room with Ms. Coquillette at Brown University. ''She's very disciplined. There's nothing that will alter her everyday regimen.'',Mr. Koven and Ms. Coquillette, who are known as Jamie and Sophie by most people, didn't start dating until three years after they met, when he traveled to Boston for the Head of the Charles Regatta and called her. Very soon, it was clear they were madly in love.,''They had their first date in October 1997, and six days later was the regatta,'' Mr. Caspersen said. ''As Jamie got into the boat, he gave me a quick wave and said to Sophia, 'One more kiss before the race,' in this teddy bear voice. I thought to myself, 'Game over.' '',Mr. Koven proposed last summer while they were canoeing in upstate New York, surrounded by lily pads, butterflies and dragonflies. ''It was spontaneous and natural,'' Ms. Coquillette said. ''He didn't have the ring, which was really nice. He didn't dot all the i's and cross the t's.'',Like the couple, their Feb. 20 wedding was unfrivolous, yet full of sentiment. It took place at the Friends Meeting at Cambridge, a tranquil place with wooden benches and bare walls painted the color of coffee ice cream. Even the programs were austere, printed on limestone-colored paper in a typeface reminiscent of an old manual typewriter.,As a fire crackled in a stone hearth and a lutenist played Renaissance melodies, the bride arrived in a simple sleeveless dress with a boat neck. Following Quaker tradition, the ceremony had a long period of silence. ''There wasn't much to focus on but Jamie and Sophie holding hands and sharing whispers,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''It was extremely emotional and exposing.'',After the silence, the Rev. Janet Cooper-Nelson, the university chaplain at Brown, read ''thanksgivings'' from the couple. Ms. Coquillette gave thanks for ''Jamie's wholehearted and unabashed enthusiasm for life, including dancing, rowing, snowboarding, being with friends.'' She also gave thanks that he was amused by her ''need for coffee, love of public transport and exuberant hand gesturing.'' Mr. Koven gave thanks for ''long walks, the dancing, the competitive Scrabble games'' and the ''lily pads, flowers, butterflies and dragonflies'' that will always remind him of the day they got engaged and their wedding day.",LOIS SMITH BRADY,"FEB. 28, 1999",VOWS; Sophie Coquillette and Jamie Koven,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/style/vows-sophie-coquillette-and-jamie-koven.html

"THERE was a moment that was so moving it actually sent shivers into the scalp at the Chinese New Year celebration last weekend at the County Center here. Ke-Zaheng Wen, a 70-year-old internationally known bass-baritone originally from China, was singing ''Ol' Man River.'' The power of his voice was wonderful, but most stunning were his inflections and phrasing, the way he sang the words, in Chinese-accented English, as if they had been written for him:,''I get weary and sick of trying, I'm tired of living and scared of dying, but Ol' Man River, he just keeps rolling along.'',This quintessentially American song, he said after the performance, moves him from the heart. Although in Jerome Kern's ''Show Boat,'' it is sung by a poor 19th-century black man, Mr. Wen said he found in it something pertinent to his life. ''In China, when the Cultural Revolution came, it was not the workers who were oppressed and persecuted, it was the artists and intellectuals,'' he said through an interpreter. ''For many of us, it was a nightmare.'' The river, he added, could have been the Yangtze as well as the Mississippi; the fatalistic sorrow, his own at the time of China's upheaval. In English, he said, ''This song, I have very much deep feeling for.'',In similar but less dramatic ways, the blend of Chinese and American and Eastern and Western cultures was evident throughout the evening. Sponsored by the local branch of the National Organization of Chinese Americans, which focuses on immigration and other legal issues, and the Westchester Chinese Association, a nonprofit cultural group, it was a festivity heralding the arrival of the Year of the Rabbit. Virtually everyone there had been born either in China or Taiwan or had parents who had been. There were plenty of traditional Chinese dances and songs; almost all of the 600 people attending wore at least some red, the traditional color of good luck.,But there were many American influences as well. Teen-agers who on stage wore silk robes and pajamas of fuchsia and lime appeared afterward in blue jeans and leather jackets. Not everyone munched red bean cakes or dumplings, the traditional New Year's foods, but pizza and fries from the concession stand. And the night ended with adults and children doing the macarena to music played by a disk jockey.,''It's really good to feel both Chinese and American,'' said Petula Shyu, a 16-year-old student at Scarsdale High School and, on Saturdays, at the Chinese School of Southern Westchester in Edgemont, where she learns Mandarin Chinese. ''I was born here. I am an American, but I'm also Chinese. With my family, a big part of that is respecting your ancestors. On the actual New Year -- this year, it was Tuesday, Feb. 16 -- we go to see my maternal grandmother in Brooklyn. She is 88. Then we go visit other relatives and friends, in the traditional way.'',Smiling and nodding approval were Betty Hsieh, who works at International Business Machines, and her husband, Wen Hsieh, who owns a consulting company. The Hsiehs, who live in Scarsdale, have children in college and high school. ''I grew up in Taiwan,'' Mr. Hsieh said. ''Chinese culture stresses family values, a lot of respect for the family. This is good. In America, everything is so individualistic. But that too is good. Nowhere else is society so open, so full of opportunity. The best thing is to combine the best of both worlds.'',Petula was among the teen-agers who performed on the stage of the little theater. She and Vivian Yee, also a 16-year-old from Scarsdale, were part of a folk dance called ''Embroidered Purse.'' As the girls executed graceful movements, Rose Kaung, a mathematics professor at Westchester Community College, whispered to an audience member, ''This is the story of a young woman whose love is far away, who embroiders a silk purse for him.'' Suddenly a tiny brocade pouch struck someone lightly on the shoulder. ''Oh! that is good luck,'' Mrs. Kaung said. ''The dancers throw those into the audience and whoever gets one is supposed to prosper in the new year.'',Folk music is also performed by Hsing Lih Chou. Mr. Chou, an entertainer clad in black slacks and a collarless jacket -- ''the students' 'uniform' in China,'' he said -- played guitar and sang Taiwanese songs. Born 48 years ago in Taiwan and now living in Manhattan, he teaches Asian-American studies in Manhattan and is principal of the Chinese School of Southern Westchester. Like its counterparts, the Chinese School of Northern Westchester in Somers and the Huaxia Chinese School in Hartsdale, it holds classes on weekends for elementary, middle and high school-age youngsters in Chinese language and culture.,''I like to put emotion into what I do,'' Mr. Chou said, after his spirited performance. ''One of these folk songs sounds like something by American Indians, don't you think? The same kind of sad, wailing, chanting sound. In school when I teach, I try to make the students feel things. You cannot just tell them things, you need to relate them to what they know. I don't focus on, say, the word for lo mein; instead, I will teach them how to say spaghetti in Chinese.,''When I first came to America, Oct. 29. 1976, I experienced culture shock. I flew into J.F.K. A friend picks me up and we go through Queens and across the Queensboro Bridge. I see a subway car. I see all this ugly, dirty graffiti. I said to my friend, what is this, the train that goes to the garbage dump? He said, get used to it. That's the train you'll be traveling on every day. Not only did I get used to it, now I love it.'',For some, the transition was not so easy. Generally, people of Chinese descent living in Taiwan who came to America did so completely voluntarily, for a chance at a better career or education. For some from the mainland, however, the situation was more complicated. Mingjian Gao, a 40-year-old United Nations translator now living in Scarsdale, left Beijing when he was 28. His mother, who was visiting Scarsdale for the New Year, still lives there.,''She likes to stay among her friends and what is familiar,'' he said. No permission was needed for Mr. Gao to leave -- ''By then everything was reformed,'' he said -- but he does have memories of the Red Guard ransacking his house when he was a child. ''My father was a math teacher,'' he said simply as an explanation. ''It only happened once.'',Like so many others, his life is now a mix of Chinese and American customs. For the New Year, he ate dumplings, considered in northern China to be a lucky New Year food. He did not, however, get to see the glowing displays of fireworks as he once did in China. ''That we could not provide,'' Brenda Sun, a real estate broker from Scarsdale who is one of the festival's organizers, said with a laugh. Mr. Gao added: ''Even in New York City, this year, they could not have fireworks in Chinatown. People missed them. I understand they used fake ones, little paper explosions, which was all the Mayor would allow. That's too bad. It was part of a Happy New Year celebration.''",LYNNE AMES,"FEB. 28, 1999",The View From/White Plains; Recalling Yangtze River In Song for the New Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/the-view-from-white-plains-recalling-yangtze-river-in-song-for-the-new-year.html
"PEOPLE at the Hartford Public Library are borrowing more books than ever, says Louise Blalock, the chief librarian and moving force behind the library's $36 million expansion and renovation.,But those customers may have to wait a bit longer for the project to start. The city approved $16 million in bond funds for the expansion in 1996 and after a required study and planning phase, $13 million remained when the project was put up for bids in December. The lowest of the three bids, however, was $3 million over budget and city officials are considering an extension for bids. Still, supporters of the expansion remain eager to resolve the gap and get on with the job, which was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Fletcher, Harkness, Cohen, Moneyhun, in association with Sevigny/Architects of Hartford. ''My top priority right now,'' Ms. Blalock said, ''is keeping this job moving forward.'',It isn't just that the library, which opened in 1957 and is now inadequately wired, cannot accommodate the largest inventory in the state, she said. The way it is used needs to be refocused.,She foresees a computer-enhanced, multi-disciplinary structure that, in addition to providing books and information in the most up-to-date way, will support growing efforts to reach children and families, neighborhoods and schools. ''It makes a statement about the city's commitment to information, learning and the library as a cultural center for the community,'' she said.,The expansion is to begin with a new atrium in the rear of the existing structure, opening to a three-level extension filled with books, art and audio-visual materials. This so-called glass bridge will, in turn, connect to the project's primary addition, which will house parking, meeting space with telecommunications equipment, a community television station and children's library.,When the expansion is completed, in June, 2000, if all goes well, the existing building will be renovated with new electrical, heating, ventilation and security systems, air-conditioning and windows. In all, the expansion will add 23,000 square feet, bringing the enlarged library to 54,000 square feet.,While trying to start the initial phase of the expansion, the library still needs funds to complete that phase and is conducting a capital campaign for $5 million from corporations, foundations and individuals. It will then look to a second referendum in 2000, for $15 million in bonding and a possible $500,000 in state construction money, for renovation.,Features of the renovations will include 100 computers for public use, a lab for Hartford and regional library staffs, an improved reading room and room for what is called the Hartford Collection, dedicated to the preservation and research of city documents, plus space for working writers, and a gallery for the work of state artists. ''Downtown residents can have a cappuccino,'' Ms. Blalock said, ''use a PC, read and buy books, enjoy themselves in the evening.'',The president of the library board, William M. Large, summed up the library's role in downtown Hartford. ''We have become de facto baby-sitters, homework helpers, a bright light for kids.'',Hyacinth Yennie, president of the neighborhood group Hartford Areas Rally Together, said the organization resoundingly supports the plans. ''This new library is going to be more technology-connected to schools, and that's a very exciting project.'',Ms. Blalock also wants local artists to play an enlarged role in the library's daily operation. With staff members already circulating flyers at area arts organizations, explaining how the library can further patrons' experiences, she said she was looking for new ideas on how best to use local talent.,Tim Cole, a Hartford photographer and picture framer, suggested adding secured display space and conferences and educational programs. But he said the library could do better at finding working artists not necessarily connected to established art centers. ''A whole lot of the artistic energy in the community is generated by working artists not institutionalized,'' he said.,Various foundations and corporations have offered support to improve library services, such as the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving award of $150,000 to the a family literacy program and $900,000 for extended hours and programs for new immigrants. MCI Worldcom has contributed $30,000 to help the library introduce the Internet to small businesses.,To help the city and library set a tone of openness to all this change, architects designed a curved glass wall fronting the renovated original building. ''When you're walking on Main Street,'' said Michael Cohen of the architectural firm, ''you can see what's going on in the library, see that it's active.'',He added that, with the adjacent City Hall and the Wadsworth Atheneum set farther back from the street, a new walkway will pull in pedestrians and link the three buildings. ''To be in a place that's green,'' he said, ''and end up in the courtyard of the library.'',While supporting a library with expanded  downtown services that will also reach the region, some area librarians were cautious. Denis M. Lorenz, director of library services in West Hartford, was concerned that, with so much information available on line, patrons will be less likely to seek information in Hartford. Peter Ciparelli, director of the Rockville Public Library, voiced frustration over complications some area libraries have in connecting with Hartford's automated network.,Unlike the city of Hartford's limited participation in other city construction projects like Riverfront Recapture, with multiple sources of funding, the city is running the library expansion with unusual cooperation among those involved.,Ms. Blalock said that Mayor Michael Peters, the city manager, Saundra Kee Borges, and city council members have all worked together. ''They recognize we all want a great city, and know we need a great library to have a great city,'' she said.,Steven D. Park, a city councilman, said the path in front of the library will be part of a larger city walkway, informally called ''Main Street U.S.A.'' It will eventually link the city's notable buildings, from The Old State House to The Bushnell Auditorium, he said. ''It will be a cultural walkway.'',Ms. Blalock said she believed the project would set the tone for other growth in the city, comparing her venture to similar library expansion projects in Denver, St. Louis and Cleveland. ''Wherever this has happened,'' she said, ''it has been a key to urban renewal.'',So, with fingers crossed, she said she hoped for a resolution to the budget issues and a return to setting priorities for a 21st century library. ''It is a place that brings communities together -- and honors the book,'' she said.",STEPHEN L.

"WHEN I was around 16, freshly emerged from a bout of adolescence complete with pimples, braces and a sullen personality to match (if external beauty is a reflection of the inner soul, then I was transparent), my mother asked me to help her serve as host to out-of-town visitors.,The American Medical Association was having a convention in San Francisco, and my mother, a doctor's wife, was going to show around delegates' wives and children. She wanted to transform me into local color -- a Chinese-looking Chinese girl -- as we traipsed through San Francisco's Chinatown. Even though I was a thoroughly Americanized, third-generation Chinese-American, on that one day I was to slip into a cheongsam, the high-collared, snug, slit-skirted Chinese dress. I was to put on sheer stockings, precariously held up by a garter belt and slip my feet into Pappagallo shoes with two-inch heels.,It was an ill fit.,The cheongsam is not just a piece of clothing. It is a dress that demands an entire persona, a special way of walking, of holding the head high, of wearing your hair, crossing your legs and moving your arms. It is a hybrid of East and West, a garment that emerged in Shanghai in the 1930's. When the Chinese bound women's feet, they shrank the parameters of her world. And to a free-spirited American girl like me, the cheongsam did the same thing. It was silken bondage, a restriction of the mind and the body.,In the 19th century, the Manchu woman, who was a member of the ruling elite, wore a pao (pronounced pow), a long, loose robe that fastened on the right side. The pao was the woman's equivalent of the man's scholar robe in terms of comfort. In a pao, a woman was unencumbered. Then in the 1920's, when Hollywood costume designers started working with the bias cut, making dresses that clung to the body, so, too, Shanghai and Hong Kong tailors started cutting traditional robes closer to the body. Until then, all clothing in China, whether worn by the indigenous Han or their conquerors, the Manchu, including jackets, skirts, trousers and robes, had been loose-fitting.,The tailors of the 30's called the new snug and sexy dress the ''qi pao'' (the term is Mandarin for ''banner gown''), because it resembled the robe worn by Manchu women, who were called ''the women of the banner.'' The Cantonese word ''cheongsam'' means ''long gown,'' but ''qi pao'' and ''cheongsam'' are used interchangeably, said Valerie Steele, curator of ''China Chic: East Meets West,'' an exhibition of 125 pieces of traditional and modern clothing, on view at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan through April 24. ''The qi pao was a combination of the Chinese man's robe, the Manchu woman's long robe and the Western woman's frock,'' Ms. Steele said.,Long sleeves, once signifiers of modesty, became short. Cleavage was still hidden, but the slits inched higher and higher. In the 1960 film, ''The World of Suzie Wong,'' Suzie, the prostitute, wore her cheongsam slit to the thigh. Well-bred women were more demure, with their slits shorter and more discreet, but still revealing a few inches of upper leg. To elongate the line, women wore high heels and stockings. This long, sinuous silhouette implied a sleekness, a restrained sexuality.,Over all, the cheongsam is a paradoxical creation, sending out mixed messages, modest in the bodice (no cleavage) and brazen in the skirt (much thigh.) ''The idea of bodily modesty, of not showing your figure, walking in small steps and not extending your body in space -- that dates back to instruction books for women in the Han Dynasty, around the second century A.D.,'' said Dorothy Ko, a professor of Chinese history and women's studies at Rutgers University. ''Don't speak unless spoken to. Be demure. And if you're a woman, don't be visible.'',For my 16-year-old self, the descent into invisibility, also known as deep discomfort, began with the high, stiff collar. A swan might be happy in the cheongsam's collar, or maybe Marella Agnelli or Jacqueline de Ribes, European beauties famed for their lithe, long necks. But I have an ordinary neck, a scant few inches that attaches my head to my shoulders. Swanlike, I am not. When I buttoned the collar of the cheongsam, I began to choke psychically. I could breathe, but I could scarcely move. I was pinned and trapped, like the African women who wear dozens of necklaces around their necks.,I held my head in the only position possible: straight up, perpendicular to the street. Slouching was out of the question. So was tossing the head back in a fit of spontaneous laughter. I could tilt my head, in a slight, coy manner, like posters showing Chinese actresses and beauty queens. No doubt that was the point.,The dress -- a silvery-gray brocade with pale pink blossoms on it -- slipped over the breasts and fitted snug at the waist and over the belly. The hem glided just past my knees. My arms, gently restricted, were caught in the vise of little cap sleeves set in small, round armholes. I couldn't throw my arms up in the air like a cheerleader. I couldn't do the twist on a dance floor. At best, I could use my hands and flutter a few fingers. Exuberance vanished, and a coerced daintiness took its place.,The simple act of walking, putting one foot in front of the other, was no easy task. Since high heels were required, and the skirt was so narrow, I could only mince about. With my mother and her guests in tow, I minced down Grant Avenue to Union Square. I minced up California Street from Chinatown to the Fairmont Hotel. And as I moved, I worried constantly. Would my stockings snag? What if my dress, a slippery satin, slid up when I sat down and the garter belt showed? (This was B. P. -- before pantyhose.) What if the top of my stockings showed? The thigh?,If an inch of thigh poked out did that mean I was a bar girl? (No. I looked too gangly.) But it might give away the ruse that I was not a sophisticated denizen of the Orient, a creature who was enigmatic, mysterious and subtle.,On that one day, I pretended to be modest and full of grace, tethered to an ancient standard of decorum. As I blended in with the other Chinatown women, in my cheongsam, moving  willowlike down Grant Avenue, I became invisible, one of many small-stepping, black-haired women. The next day I would return to being a roller-skating, volleyball-playing, all-American teen-ager. But for a few awkward hours, I was a fake lady.",ELAINE LOUIE,"FEB. 28, 1999",VIEW; A Cheongsam Lesson at 16,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/style/view-a-cheongsam-lesson-at-16.html
"'NOSFERATU PHANTOM DER NACHT',Anchor Bay. $14.95. 107 minutes. (German with English subtitles.),'NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE',Anchor Bay.$14.95. 107 minutes. (English version),From the moment he answers his forbidding front door high in the Carpathians, one knows this is a different kind of Dracula. Starting with F. W. Murnau's classic count in ''Nosferatu'' in 1922 and running through Francis Ford Coppola's ravenous scourge in ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' in 1992, Draculas have been harsh, decisive types. Not that this fellow provides much of a letup, but there's something less unbending about him.,As envisioned by Werner Herzog in 1979's ''Nosferatu the Vampyre,'' this Dracula, portrayed with marvelous fluidity and emotion by Klaus Kinski, turns pensive and at times almost wistful. Physically he's on the small side, or that's the impression. The head is bald and skull-like, the complexion like chalk. His eyes are set deep in black holes and his ears flare from his head like Mercury's winged heels. Prominent incisors suggest the bat, as do the webbed claws that serve as hands.,There at Dracula's portal, quivering and lucky to have made it to this great musty pile of a place, stands the young clerk Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz), fresh (actually not so fresh after a four-week trek on foot and horseback) from the Netherlandsto conduct business. Dracula contemplates him for a long time with the knowing, what-have-we-here expression one associates with Dracula, tempered by a quizzical shyness.,Here is a vulnerable Dracula, one who is in pain and not averse to showing it. By way of explaining himself to Harker and later to Harker's stalwart wife, Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), whose lovely young neck he strongly admires and will soon partake of, he expresses his loneliness and despair. It's terrible not being able to die, he says, staring at her soulfully.,Amazingly, too, in contrast to other formidable Herzog films like ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God,'' there is something dryly funny about it. On these new wide-screen format tapes, Mr. Herzog's movie remains hauntingly atmospheric, with all its curious edges in place. For example, 11,000 rats brought by the Count from Transylvania are quite a sight on pristine Dutch streets, where they spread plague, inciting surreal scenes of madness and death.,Best viewed in its German version, ''there's more identity to it,'' Mr. Herzog said recently. He regards Murnau's ''Nosferatu'' as perhaps the best film ever made. Murnau was also German and a forefather to Mr. Herzog, who was born in 1942. ''Postwar German filmmakers had no fathers,'' he said. ''They were all either Nazis or they had been exiled. So we had to look back and connect with our grandfathers.'',Associating his film with Murnau's helped to make that link for Mr. Herzog. ''I felt as if I'd crossed a river and touched bottom on the other side,'' he said. ''I'm connected. I have ground under my feet.'',PETER M. NICHOLS",PETER M.

"JIMI HENDRIX: 'BAND OF GYPSIES',MCA, $14.95, 83 minutes.,It was for the most part a short-lived rehearsal band, a trio convened during Hendrix's transition time after the ''Electric Ladyland'' album, but Band of Gypsies must have been the best rehearsal band ever. Released by the Jimi Hendrix estate, this film operates out of the altogether sensible proposition that Band of Gypsies ought to be considered as a discrete project, different from the rest of Hendrix's career.,Hendrix had previously been flanked on stage by two white Englishmen, but at the end of 1969 he was playing with two black Americans: his army buddy, the bassist Billy Cox, and the drummer Buddy Miles. It was a racially loaded statement, and the music they made was blacker in two senses of the word: it was more rhythm-and-blues-based, and it was graver in tone. (Though, as the radio host Frankie Crocker attests, that still didn't gain Hendrix much of a foothold on black radio; to this day, he is perceived as the white rock fan's black hero.),Much of the remarkable Dec. 31, 1969, concert at New York's Fillmore East that was recorded for the live album ''Band of Gypsies'' is included here, and so are interviews with musicians and record producers. Hendrix, in a few interview sequences, comes across as a low-key, nonpolitical, angelic musical obsessive who refuses to believe his own hype:,''Some say you're the best guitarist alive,'' Dick Cavett says.,''How about the best guitarist sitting in this chair,'' Hendrix counters.,BEN RATLIFF",BEN RATLIFF,"FEB. 28, 1999",VIDEO; A Blacker Hendrix,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/video-a-blacker-hendrix.html

"The courtroom success that David Boies has enjoyed depends on thorough preparation, plenty of backup from lawyers for the Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft, and a steel-trap memory. He starts with a script but, far more than most lawyers, varies from it. He will let a witness give a rambling speech and then, seizing on a spoken sentence or two, he recalls a document among thousands in evidence that refutes the witness's testimony.,Microsoft insists that these ''gotcha moments'' of courtroom drama may be prominently reported in daily news accounts of the trial, but that they do not undermine the factual record of the case.,Whatever the legal impact, it is often an impressive performance -- made possible by Mr. Boies's formidable memory, which helps him overcome the fact that he is dyslexic. A late reader as a child, he still reads with difficulty. ''He overcompensates with an overwhelming memory,'' observed his wife, Mary Boies, who is also a lawyer.,In his defense of I.B.M. in a 13-year Federal antitrust case dropped in 1982, Mr. Boies, then a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, prepared to cross-examine the Government's economic witness by reading some background papers and being briefed for a half-hour by two colleagues. During the briefing, Mr. Boies wrote four words on a yellow legal pad, recalled another lawyer who worked on the case. He then cross-examined the Government's economist for five days with those four words as his notes. ''It was a tour de force,'' the lawyer recalled.,Mr. Boies, who left Cravath in 1997 to start his own firm, Boies & Schiller, is working for the Justice Department only on the Microsoft case. His rate works out to under $50 an hour, he figures, less than one-tenth his usual rate. By all accounts, it has been a bargain for the Government.,The Microsoft legal team is led by William Neukom, Microsoft's tall, silver-haired general counsel, and a corps of lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell including John Warden, Richard Urowsky and Steven Holley.,Mr. Neukom, 57, has been handling the company's legal affairs since 1979 when he was working at the Seattle law firm of the Microsoft chairman's father, William H. Gates Jr.. (The software entrepreneur is William H. Gates 3d.) The senior Mr. Gates asked Mr. Neukom to handle a lease for his son's 12-person software company, which was moving from Albuquerque to a Seattle suburb.,Mr. Neukom bridles at the suggestion that Microsoft's defense has stumbled badly. ''No one has an opinion that is worth a nickel unless he or she has read all the written testimony, read all the court transcripts and seen all the videotapes,'' he said.,The daily press coverage of the trial, he insists, is a distortion because the stories magnify a dramatic moment or two while largely ignoring the substance of the case.,The Boies approach, in Mr. Neukom's view, is to use the ''high jinks of courtroom theatrics to try to obscure the evidentiary record.'',Still, legal experts are skeptical. The Microsoft side, they say, has made a puzzling number of basic mistakes, noting that witnesses should not be surprised by documents or prior testimony.,''This case is the buzz of the legal community, and it's an embarrassment for Sullivan & Cromwell and Microsoft,'' said Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University Law School. ''The one way they can redeem themselves is to win, if not in this round then before the appeals court or the Supreme Court. It's always hard to argue with victory.''",STEVE LOHR,"FEB. 28, 1999","U.S. Ace in the Case: A Steel-Trap Memory, an Eye for the Jugular",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/us-ace-in-the-case-a-steel-trap-memory-an-eye-for-the-jugular.html
"The nation's largest apparel union has accused the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, the nation's largest shirtmaker, of undercutting workers' rights by closing its factory in Guatemala -- the only unionized factory among the more than 200 export-oriented apparel factories in that country.,Jay Mazur, president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said the factory closing was intended to warn apparel workers at other plants in Guatemala and Central America that if they voted to join a union their jobs would be in jeopardy.,But Bruce J. Klatsky, chairman of Phillips-Van Heusen, which is based in New York City, said that the union was blowing the plant closing out of proportion. He said the company had closed the Guatemala City factory because a large customer, Mercantile Stores, had turned to another company to make its shirts, leaving Phillips with too many factories.,Mr. Klatsky insisted that the decision to shut the plant had nothing to do with the fact that it was unionized. He noted that the company had closed two other plants in recent months.,''We face this problem pretty significantly,'' Mr. Klatsky said. ''We just couldn't maintain continuous and efficient production in a smooth fashion.'',Mr. Klatsky said his company, which also makes apparel under the G. H. Bass, Gant and Izod labels, was a leader among American apparel companies in terms of working conditions and factory monitoring.,Union officials said Phillips-Van Heusen was hypocritical, because it was one of the few companies participating in the White House anti-sweatshop task force and had agreed to take a tougher stance against poor working conditions than most other apparel makers.,In 1997, after a six-year struggle, the 500 employees at the Guatemala City factory obtained a union contract, which significantly improved their wages and the quality of the water at the plant.,''The contract these workers had was a beacon of hope for more than 80,000 maquiladora workers in Guatemala,'' Mr. Mazur said, referring to maquiladoras -- factories in special low-tariff zones that export almost all their output.,''By shutting the factory, Phillips-Van Heusen sent a message to other workers in Guatemala: If you fight for justice, if you fight for a union, we will not honor your contract. We will walk away.''",STEVEN GREENHOUSE,"FEB. 28, 1999",Union Criticizes Plant Closing in Guatemala,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/union-criticizes-plant-closing-in-guatemala.html
"To the Editor: Because it was about one of our favorite places, ''Anatolia's Ancient Ports of Call'' by Stephen Kinzer (Jan. 31) got my attention. We have taken a similar trip on the Turkish Coast, but from Marmaris to Antalya. We were also aboard a gulet for a week and then enjoyed a 10-day land tour. Your writer correctly advises contacting an American travel agency ''that regularly sends clients to Turkey.'' But he mentions only Pacha Tours.,I would like to mention Club Voyages, based in Atlantic Highlands, N.J. Patricia Goksel, the owner, planned our trip to Turkey in June 1996. Her husband, Kemal Goksel, who is Turkish, led the Turkish Coast cruise aboard two beautiful and spotlessly clean gulets. There were 28 of us from the Pacific Corinthian Yacht Club in Southern California. The Goksels visit Turkey several times a year to inspect the gulets and yachts that they recommend. Our trip aboard the Ipek and Dalga was a result of this attention to detail, as were our excellent captains and crew -- and later the operators for the land tour.

"THE GROUP of female American tourists danced a crowd-stopping dance of the veil. Outside the vast shrine in the center of Mashad, Iran, the women struggled with their chadors, shroudlike garments that cover all but the face and must be secured with one hand held under the chin. There are no hooks or zippers to make the job easier.,It wasn't enough that we were already wearing scarves on our heads and loose garments that hid the shape of our torsos. This was the holiest pilgrimage site in Iran, the place where Imam Reza, the eighth of the 12 imams, or religious leaders, in Shiite Islam, died in the ninth century and is buried. And even though the shrine itself was off limits to non-Muslims, we were allowed to walk through the outer courtyard, watch an informational film at a foreign reception center and tour the museums on the vast compound. But only if we disguised ourselves in the veils that our guide handed out as we emerged from our bus.,Iranian schoolchildren giggled at the sight. A grizzled Iranian man asked to have his picture taken with us. One of the men in our group threw his sportcoat over his head and jumped into the picture.,''It's the equivalent of feet-binding in China, anything to keep women off-balance!'' complained Isabel Jacobs, a retired history teacher from Riverdale, in the Bronx.,''Before I came here, I believed in women's liberation,'' said Dorothy Wright, a retired teacher of English literature from Middletown, N.J. ''Now I believe in women's domination!'',Even I, who have been going to Iran as a journalist for 20 years, have never gotten used to this unwieldy garment, which lets me take notes only if I hold it together in my teeth.,In the early years of Iran's 1979 revolution, tourists -- particularly American tourists -- were considered dangerous invaders bent on sullying Islamic purity with Western culture. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,  the father of Iran's revolution, liked to rant about ''the Western sickness among us,'' stating plainly that ''there is no fun in Islam.'' Indeed, I never went to Iran for the night life.,These days, American tourists are no longer considered as ugly as they once were. Iran's regime is beginning to smile back, luring them with its treasures: the monumental ruins of ancient Persia, the intricately patterned mosques of Islam, the glittering palaces of the shahs, the landscapes of snowcapped mountains and rice paddies and palm-studded deserts. For about two years, intrepid Americans have ventured in, most of them on group tours organized by American and Canadian companies, but some on customized private visits.,The pace of the visits quickened after January 1998, when Iran's smiling President, Mohammed Khatami, used an interview with CNN to initiate a ''cultural exchange'' of intellectuals, artists and tourists to break down what he called ''the wall of mistrust'' between the United States and Iran. The steep drop in oil prices in the past year has contributed to Iran's eagerness to attract dollar-carrying Americans.,The family and friends of my 18 traveling companions thought they were crazy to come. We were, after all, in a country that the Clinton Administration considers the world's most active fomenter of terrorism, that once held American diplomats hostage and that has no official relations with the United States. Consular matters are handled by the Swiss, whose country represents American interests.,Indeed, in late November, just days after our return home, a bus carrying 17 American business executives returning to their hotel from the airport was attacked by a small band of angry young men wielding clubs and bats who smashed the bus windows and chanted in Farsi, ''God is great! Death to America!'',The driver sped off across town to another hotel, where the group sought refuge until they could make it safely back to their own. The Americans remained under the protection of the Swiss. The Swiss Ambassador escorted the group to the airport for its departure the next night.,Shortly before the attack, a hard-line newspaper had announced that the group included spies disguised as tourists. And afterward, the organization claiming responsibility issued a communique stating, ''Your children performed their first operation against American spies.'' It added, ''Iran is no place for American Yankees and our next operation will be the performance of our slogan 'Death to America.' '',No one was injured; Iranian officials loudly condemned the attack and American visitors have been left unharmed since then. But the incident was a chilling reminder that Iran is not a benign place, even to visit. And it just as easily could have been our group, which included a retired Navy captain and a retired Foreign Service officer.,But our small band was intrepid, well traveled and well prepared. Members talked knowingly of the volcanic sands of Guatemala, the cashews of Mozambique,  the barracudas of Belize. They carried medical kits that included sutures and hypodermic needles. They knew how to check the tires of domestic airplanes. They could find the 24-hour supermarket in Teheran to buy caviar and the synagogues in Isfahan on their own.,Our 14-day journey took us through Teheran, Mashad, Kermanshah, Hamadan, Kerman, Bam, Yazd, Shiraz, Persepolis, Isfahan, Kashan and Qum. We were free to go wherever we wanted and, except for military installations, airports, mosque interiors and some museums, took photographs as we wished.,The Americans came for various reasons. Lois Clark, a retired teacher, and her husband, Daniel, a retired radiologist, from Iowa, were struggling to understand the culture that shaped their Iranian-born son-in-law. Martha Habermann, who runs a nursing home in upstate New York, called it ''the frisson of doing something adventurous.'' Ronald Endeman, a lawyer from San Diego, counted Iran as the 235th country he has visited so far (but then, he counted places like Sicily and Hawaii as countries, too).,Our guide was Hossein Shams-ol-mali, a retired teacher who couldn't quite support himself and his wife on his small pension. No matter that his English was flawed and his explanations opaque. Mr. Shams, as we called him, was a gentleman, ever patient with our endless questions. (Why are there no dogs on the street? Do Jews serve in the Army? Do dervishes really whirl?) He also played bellman and waiter when necessary.,Our tour was run by Bestway Tours and Safaris, of Vancouver, British Columbia, although several of us who had booked through Absolute Asia, a New York-based company, didn't know that until we arrived. We also discovered that Bestway had charged tour members only $2,790 for their trip, excluding air fare; we had paid Absolute Asia $3,125. Absolute Asia explained in a letter that the additional cost covered ''personalized itinerary planning'' as well as visa processing. (In fact I had arranged my own visa.),Iran's tourist infrastructure functions surprisingly well, considering how few high-paying tourists have ventured in over the last two decades. The hotels built during the oil boom of the 1970's have seen better days, but have been renovated and function fairly well. Domestic air travel is cheap, remarkably safe and on time. Pharmacies are well stocked. Persian cuisine is a delight (when one can get away from the ubiquitous kabobs); fresh fruits and vegetables are grown throughout the country, and in Teheran the tap water is considered better than the bottled variety.,But our tour bus was in need of repair and cleaning. The air-conditioning blew hard through the holes where overhead lights should have been. There were no seat belts and no toilet. The choking air pollution from leaded gasoline fumes can be troubling for people with respiratory problems, particularly in the big cities such as Teheran and Isfahan.,Except at the mosques, the women in our group took risks with their dress almost from the start. Our guide made the mistake of telling us at our first orientation that we did not have to wear the poorly sewn, ankle-length polyester coats handed out at the beginning of the tour. So some women donned their husbands' shirts over pants and exchanged their scarves for hats. It was unseasonably hot, so we even dared to go bareheaded on the bus, which elicited wide-eyed stares (but no arrests).,Still, there were uncomfortable incidents when perfect strangers told us we were misbehaving. For instance, when one female tour member posed for a photograph with a group of giggling Iranian women in their chadors in Mashad, a man barked at the women not to allow their faces to be photographed.,Bending the rules did not extend to alcohol. When security guards at Teheran's Mehrabad Airport discovered several tiny bottles of liquor in the suitcase of one tour member, there were threats to confiscate our luggage, hold up our departure and even try the alleged culprit in an Iranian court. Eventually, the security guard and airport police were paid off; we made our flight.,There were times when political reality and the official animosity toward the United States intruded. Some of my fellow travelers were offended by a neon sign at Teheran's airport announcing in English that, ''In future, Islam will destroy Satanic sovereignty of the West.'',''With one hand they're telling us we're demons,'' said Ms. Wright. ''With the other hand, they're taking our money.'',We happened to be in Isfahan on the 19th anniversary of the seizure of the United States Embassy in Teheran, which began the 444-day nightmare of American diplomats held hostage and led to the rupture of diplomatic relations with Iran. Banners hanging throughout the city proclaimed ''Death to America'' in Farsi and ''Down With U.S.A.'' in English. We were kept far away from the city's demonstration --  largely of schoolchildren bused in for the event -- at a sports stadium.,The lead story on the television news that night showed footage from demonstrations in more than a dozen cities around the country. The only problem was that some of the footage obviously came from the archives. Still, members of our group were not amused. ''I've been smiling at people up to now,'' said Fritz Wright, a retired engineer. ''At this point I don't know whether to smile at them or not.'',Our tour did not include a drive-by of the confiscated American Embassy compound in Teheran, for years a school for training revolutionary guards. But I took two of the members of our group for a firsthand look on our last day. Its walls had been freshly painted with anti-American images, including a giant head of a skeleton as the Statue of Liberty.,THROUGHOUT the trip, the official animosity towards the United States Government contrasted sharply with the shock and sheer joy of ordinary Iranians in encountering Americans who liked Iran well enough to come touring. ''In China, people come up to you and talk, but they don't kiss you and say they love you like they do here,'' said Ms. Habermann. When I told a porter in the hotel in Hamadan, which is off the foreign tourist track, where I was from, he looked bewildered. ''Who let you in?'' he asked.,What makes it especially difficult to penetrate the country is that Iranians operate in two worlds. Behavior is much more relaxed in the privacy of one's home, where even the most devout Muslim women remove their head coverings. And in secular families, one may even be offered a shot of bootleg vodka or a glass of homemade wine. For the most part, our group operated in a parallel universe, seeing the externals.,But there were moments of discovery, many of them disheartening. Katharine Loring, an emergency room nurse and bicyclist, said that Iran would be a great place to take a bike trek, but then learned that men and women must ride bikes on segregated tracks. Mr. Endeman, the lawyer, gave a young Iranian woman friend of mine a good-bye hug in front of our hotel in Shiraz, and she recoiled in fear: Men and women who are not close relatives are not even supposed to shake hands.,Inside the shrine of the brother of Imam Reza in Shiraz, where women wept and moaned as they begged God for favors, Ms. Loring cuddled the baby of a mother of two. ''Take my baby to America,'' the mother said matter-of-factly. ''She is better off growing up there.'' When Ms. Loring balked, the woman said she could take her 7-year-old daughter instead, much to the horror of the girl, who clutched her mother's leg.,The American women were incensed that Iranian women have to ride in the back of the bus. And then there was the incident of the restaurant toilets in in Shiraz. The men's was a familiar Western, chairlike model; the women's was, as in most places, a porcelain hole in the ground that required squatting. The women simply barged past the male attendant into the men's room.,And it was those restrictions, those arbitrary limits on freedom, that irritated Mel Jiganti, a retired judge from Chicago who came carrying a paperback copy of the Koran. ''The only other place I've ever felt like this was in the Army, when I had a sergeant who had arbitrary power over me,'' he said.,Then the magic of Iran took over.,We sought refuge from the stares and smog on the footpaths of the enormous Bagh-e Eram in Shiraz, a sprawling public garden filled with 200-year-old cypress, pomegranate, salt cedar and sour cherry trees, musk roses, coxcomb and honeysuckle.,We soaked in the view of palm groves in the desert from the top of the medieval mud-walled citadel and town at Bam, then sipped mango juice at a charming teahouse there run by an Iranian woman who beckoned with the words, ''We are waiting for you.'',We left the world of Shiite Islam far behind in Hamadan at a mausoleum with a basket of yarmulkes at the entrance and a wall engraved with the Ten Commandments in Hebrew. There, according to legend, Esther and Mordecai are buried.,We discovered a wedding reception at our hotel one evening in Shiraz and ventured in for a peek. The sister of the bride introduced us around to the other women, dressed in fancy cocktail dresses, their hair lacquered, their faces beautifully made up. They danced in a conga line led by the bride. The men, meanwhile, were banished to a separate room, just as at an Orthodox Jewish wedding.,But it was Persepolis, the seat of Persia's ancient kings and Iran's most important archeological treasure, that awed the Americans. Walking through the vast remains of the palace started in the sixth century B.C. by Darius the Great reduced our garrulous group to few words.,So should Americans who have been everywhere else go to Iran? ''If you wait until it gets more efficient, all the spontaneity and surprise will be lost,'' said Cynthia Katz, a part-time travel agent from Nyack, N.Y.,  as we walked through the vast, perfectly proportioned 17th-century  square in the center of Isfahan. ''When this place starts looking like the Sistine Chapel with wall-to-wall people, it's not going to be fun anymore.'',But Thomas H. Miner, the chairman of the Chicago-based Mid-America Committee, who had led the tour of the Americans who were attacked, admitted in an interview that he might have gone to Iran too soon. ''I don't think Iranians are ready for Americans -- even tourists,'' he said. ''I don't think there is anyone in that country who can protect you.'',Arranging a trip,Logistics,It's hard to go it alone as a tourist in Iran. Technically, tourists must be invited by the Iranian Government. A number of American companies provide organized tours and can facilitate the visa application process. In the absence of diplomatic relations, it is probably safer traveling with a tour operator known to Iranian authorities. Inventive travelers can add on their own personalized itineraries. On our tour one woman in her 60's spent several days before our arrival traveling with a female guide to the ancient ruins in Susa, and several days afterward at the Caspian Sea. She said this part of the trip went better than our tour.,Traveling with a prepaid tour also allows one to avoid taking a large amount of cash. The embargo theoretically precludes Iranians from cashing traveler's checks drawn on American banks or accepting American credit cards. However, on this trip I used a Mastercard from Chase Manhattan at hotels in Teheran and  Isfahan. The staff could not explain how it circumvented the embargo.,Tour Companies,I bought my tour through Absolute Asia in New York, (800) 736-8187; it was operated by Bestway Tours and Safaris (see below). Tour members who booked through Bestway paid less than the $3,125 a person that Absolute Asia charged. Ken Fish, president of Absolute Asia, said the company was now dealing directly with an Iranian company and had 15-night tours for $2,625 and $2,895 a person.,Other companies selling tours to Iran include the following:,Bestway Tours and Safaris, Vancouver, British Columbia, (800) 663-0844.,Cyrus Travel in San Jose, Calif., (800) 332-9787.,Distant Horizons in Long Beach, Calif., (800) 333-1240.,Geographic Expeditions in San Francisco, (800) 777-8183.,It is possible to put together an itinerary directly with an Iranian company such as Iran Ziggurat Tour and Travel Agency, (9821) 643-9539,  fax (9821) 643-9538.,A number of Western airlines fly to Iran, and tickets can be booked through tour operators. I use V.T.S. Travel, (703) 790-9779, a small agency in Vienna, Va., owned by Vajihe Tahbaz, charming Iranian woman.,Hotels,Many of the better hotels were once part of American hotel chains and have been renovated. Most hotel personnel speak English.,Of the eight hotels where we stayed during our tour, only one, the Akhavan Hotel in Kerman, was inadequate. Guests complained of leaky toilets, dirty carpets and insects.,Here are some hotels of note; tax of 18 percent is added to all rates.,ISFAHAN  Grand Abbasi Hotel, (98-31) 22-6011, fax (98-31) 22-6008. This 218-room hotel built around the skeleton of a caravanserai is by far the best place to stay in Iran, with dazzling carpets, tile work and carvings. Ask for a room in the original part of the hotel. Doubles start at $95.,SHIRAZ  Homa Hotel, (98-71) 28-001, fax (98-71) 48-021, has been renovated and provides good service.It is where wealthy local people hold their weddings. Doubles from $95.,TEHERAN  Karoon Hotel, (98-21) 890-1848, fax (98-21) 890-1962, is a small, simple inexpensive hotel in the center of Teheran with a welcoming manager, worn carpets and temperamental plumbing and phones. Doubles from $40.,Laleh Hotel, (98-21) 65-5021, fax (98-21) 65-5517, has towels and glasses still bearing the Inter-Continental logo. Most of the staff is friendly and eager to please. Doubles from $99.,Homa Hotel, the former Sheraton, (98-21) 877-3021, fax (98-21) 879-7179, is newer than the Laleh, but the staff is not as nice. Doubles from $120.,Food,Many of Iran's best restaurants (and all its fine wine cellars) closed with the coming of the revolution 20 years ago. Our group ate mainly in hotels, where the food was plentiful and reliable but not special. The best  way to dine in Iran is to get invited to a private home, difficult but not impossible even for first-time visitors because Iranians are so hospitable.,One of my favorite restaurants is Ali Qapoo in Teheran, (98-21) 878-4120, less because of the food than the lively atmosphere and the musicians (only male) who play traditional music. Dinner, about $33 for two.,There are many different kinds of khoresh, slowly simmering stews served with rice. The best is khoresh fesenjoon, a duck stew cooked in walnut and pomegranate sauce.,Caviar is expensive in restaurants, when it is available; better to go to the 24-hour Refah supermarket chain in Teheran. Good hotels have refrigerators in the rooms.   ELAINE SCIOLINO,Caveat,The United States State Department, in its April 1998 Travel Warning on Iran, toned down its previous warning to reflect President Khatami's call for dialogue and an increase in private exchanges between Iranians and Americans. However, it still warns United States citizens to defer travel to Iran.,American travelers should register their passport information with the Foreign Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in,Teheran, which handles legal and consular matters for Americans but does not offer full consular services.

"The new National Center for Popular Music is scheduled to open tomorrow in Sheffield in northern England, 165 miles from London. Sheffield is the home of the well-known pop music groups Pulp and Def Leppard (it was also made famous in the 1997  film ''The Full Monty''). The center was created to inform visitors about the history and impact of pop music.,The building, which was designed by Branson Coates Architecture, a British firm, consists of four large stainless steel drums, each with 32,300 square feet of space for permanent exhibitions, and also houses a space for temporary shows, cafe, bar and shop. The opening exhibition focuses on albums or music that have most influenced the lives of celebrities.,The permanent exhibitions are housed in each of the four drums. ''Perspectives'' celebrates the music's diversity and its influences. Themes include the power of love songs, the importance of dance, and popular music's relationship with social change. ''Making Music'' examines how popular music is created, recorded and distributed;  visitors can play an instrument, mix a record, design a record sleeve or present a radio show. In ''Turning Points,'' four 10-minute, large-scale films are shown across three screens reflecting the global impact of popular music, and a huge glass World Wall allows visitors to listen to sounds from around the world. Data bases provide information about 800 significant artists and groups. The fourth drum, ''Soundscapes,'' features a 200-seat auditorium where ''ambisonic'' sound will use 16 speakers in two rings of 8 to move sounds around the auditorium, as opposed to merely from the side and rear.,The National Center for Popular Music, Paternoster Row, Sheffield, will be open from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission to exhibition areas through timed tickets costs $12 on weekends and every day in July and August, $9.75 all other times. Lower rates for children, students and families. It is estimated that two and a half hours are needed to see the whole center.

"Whether or not you believe that midnight of Dec. 31, 1999, marks the dawn of the new millennium, there's no denying that many travelers plan to hit the road at the end of the year to celebrate . . . something. The demand for air tickets is ''robust,'' according to the American Society of Travel Agents.,For those who are considering a trip, a roundup of possibilities -- some admittedly extravagant -- will be offered monthly in this space until fall.

"ONE of Turkey's most imposing archeological monuments, a collection of ancient thrones and giant busts on Mount Nemrut in the eastern part of the country, is deteriorating and in urgent need of protection, according to archeologists and other experts.,The Nemrut ruins are the legacy of  a little-known kingdom called Commagene, which gained its independence from the Seleucids in 162 B.C. and was annexed to  the Roman province of Syria 234 years later. Historians call the kingdom semi-Iranian, and its kings professed a version of the Zoroastrian faith.,Pre-eminent among these kings was Antiochus I, and it was he who built the colossal heads and the rest of the vast monument on Mount Nemrut, which lies in the Anatolian highlands 510 miles east of Ankara and 100 miles north of the Syrian border. The heads, some of them nine feet high, represent deities, among them Zeus, Hercules and Apollo, as well as eagles, lions and the king himself, together with his ancestors. He built it as a funerary monument to himself in the hope that he would be remembered long after his death, and it seems he succeeded. One travel guide describes the Nemrut ensemble, which includes reliefs, a cave cistern and ruins of columns, as ''one of the most awesome sights in all of Anatolia.'' Another calls Antiochus ''a deluded king and creator of this grandiose folly.'',Until the 1960's, when a rough road was built to the mountaintop, it was accessible only by foot, a walk of two days. The road is now paved, and the site draws many tourists, among them American soldiers from the Incirlik air base 220 miles away.,Unesco placed Mount Nemrut on its list of World Heritage Sites in 1987, and it was made a national park the following year. As more people became aware of the site, efforts were made to protect it, but none has been carried to completion.,''Although it has received public attention around the world since its discovery in 1881, the Nemrut monument has never been fully appreciated in Turkey,'' the archeologist Nezih Basgelen wrote in a new book about the site. ''Unfortunately, just as earthquakes and the harsh climate in the region have taken a toll on the monument, uncontrolled, ever-increasing tourism also threatens the site.,''One solution to this problem is to move the original statuary and steles to a protected area and replace them with copies,'' Mr. Basgelen suggested. ''Before further damage occurs, a comprehensive restoration and conservation project must be undertaken on Mount Nemrut.'',A Dutch businessman and architect, Maurice Crijns, has formed a foundation aimed at preserving the Nemrut monument. The foundation has produced a five-year plan that Mr. Crijns estimates would cost $2.7 million. He said the foundation can pay for the first year or two of work, and he believes that private donors will provide the rest once the project begins. The plan has been endorsed by Turkey's culture ministry, but for reasons that are not clear, the ministry has not given him final permission to begin. Asked for comment, the ministry said that Mr. Crijns's plan was ''still under consideration.'',Mr. Crijns recently met with President Suleyman Demirel and received his blessing for the project. But so far even that has not produced final permission for work to begin. ''Many people in Turkey don't know how valuable this monument is,'' Mr. Crijns said. ''It's very unknown, and unknown makes unloved. You can see pictures of it in every travel agency in Holland, but they never say where it is.,''The problem is that the monument is deteriorating very fast, partly because of nature and partly by the hands of humans,'' he continued. ''If it is not protected, within a few years there will be nothing to protect anymore. Part of the monument is made from soft sandstone, which cannot bear the harsh climate or the kind of treatment it is getting from people. They are having picnics on the rocks, making fires -- well, let me not start complaining.'',Under the preservation plan drawn up by Mr. Crijns and his International Nemrut Foundation, based in the Dutch town of Eindhoven, guards would be posted at the site, the giant statues would be restored, sandstone reliefs would be given protective shields, and a museum would be established.,''Last October the culture ministry told us we had permission to begin work and that we should bring our team,'' Mr. Crijns said.  ''We were all there -- people from Holland, Germany and Turkey -- but the dossier did not arrive. We called Ankara and they said 'No problem, it will come tomorrow.' But it never came, and after a week we had to send everyone home.''",STEPHEN KINZER,"FEB. 28, 1999",TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; Ozymandias Endangered In Eastern Turkey,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-ozymandias-endangered-in-eastern-turkey.html
"Honduras and Belize have announced that they are open and eager for tourist business. Although Hurricane Mitch visited the area at the end of October, its impact on the tourist infrastructure was less severe than on other facilities. Diving, for instance, a major attraction in both countries, is reported to be in full swing, with many island piers in Honduras rebuilt.,The Honduran Ministry of Tourism in Tegucigalpa said early this month that the last two of the major island resorts that suffered damage had reopened on Feb. 1: Posada del Sol on Guanaja, where the hurricane hovered for 39 hours with winds up to 273 miles an hour, and Anthony's Key on nearby Roatan.,Posada del Sol reconstructed its buildings and piers. Anthony's Key completed new cabins on stilts that were described as having the same rustic appeal as before the storm, but with some improvements. The Bayman Bay Club, the other major resort on Guanaja, reopened in December; Linda Fouke, a spokeswoman, said that dive boats were taking divers out three times a day.,Belize was only slightly damaged, but assumptions that it was devastated by the storm, which was estimated to have left 10,000 dead in Honduras and Nicaragua, have reduced tourism.

"Return visitors to the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, one of the best known in the Middle East, are probably doing a double take these days. The hotel they thought they knew probably seems vaguely different as they enter the lobby, because of a recently completed three-year interior renovation by the architect Adam D. Tihany in conjunction with Lea Mahler of Jerusalem.,Mr. Tihany, noted for designing restaurants like Le Cirque 2000 and Remi in New York, said he tried to ''keep the perception of the six-story King David while changing the patina,'' by sticking to the original scale and colors of the hotel. The same blue, white and gold decor and the marble floor predominate.,The sense of change should grab hold in the rooms, which were reconfigured and redecorated. The number of rooms was reduced to 237, from 255, of which 37 are suites, an increase of 13. Four of them are duplexes. Each room has new furniture and lighting.,Perhaps the most obvious change is the moving of La Regence, the restaurant destroyed in 1946 by a bomb placed by Menachem Begin's guerrillas, to a central spot under the terrace facing the Old City.,Doubles at the King David, 23 King David Street, Jerusalem 94101, start at $306, including breakfast.

"The accused, one of the most powerful ministers in the country, asked God to influence the jurors' hearts and minds. But the minister, the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, who used the trust given him as a man of God to steal millions, found himself without divine help in a Florida courtroom.,In Pinellas County Circuit Court here today, Mr. Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc., the nation's largest black religious organization, was convicted of racketeering and grand theft, including charges that he had stolen money that was donated to a fund to rebuild black churches destroyed by arson.,Mr. Lyons, who had used the money to live a lavish life style that included a $700,000 waterfront home, a time-share condominium in Lake Tahoe, Nev., luxury cars and expensive jewelry, stood still as the verdict was read. The only thing that moved was his Adam's apple as he swallowed hard when the clerk of the court read ''guilty.'',The man who had once punctuated his sermons against sin with cries of ''I'm doing some preaching now!'' walked quietly from the courtroom, saying only that he was ''going to my church,'' to pray. Mr. Lyons, 57, faces a sentence of five to eight and a half years in prison on the charges.,For more than a month, prosecutors tried to convince a jury that Mr. Lyons had, with the help of his aide Bernice Edwards, used the good name and bogus membership lists of the 100-year-old National Baptist Convention to bilk millions from companies wanting to do business with black customers.,The evidence against the minister ''was overwhelming,'' one juror, Shannon Byrd, told reporters as she left the courtroom. But the same jury that found Mr. Lyons guilty of racketeering would, just moments later, acquit Ms. Edwards, who, prosecutors asserted, had worked hand in hand with Mr. Lyons.,Ms. Edwards, 42, sobbed quietly into the shoulder of her lawyer when the verdict was read.,''It's been so long,'' she said of the 28-day trial, her voice just above a whisper. ''I thank God and I thank my lawyer. It's been very hard.'',Ms. Edwards faced one racketeering count and was not charged in the scheme to steal money from the fund for burned black churches.,Prosecutors were happy with the verdict for Mr. Lyons, who, they asserted, betrayed the faith that he used, as his cover, to make money.,The National Baptist Convention describes itself as the nation's largest black religious organization, with more than 8.5 million members. It was access to that membership, which prosecutors said was grossly inflated, that companies wanted so they could peddle life insurance, burial plots and credit cards.,Mr. Lyons, who is out on bond while he awaits sentencing, is scheduled to stand trial in April in Federal court on 54 counts of tax evasion, extortion and money laundering. Ms. Edwards also faces similar charges in Federal court.,The verdict, which the jury reached this morning, was delayed until this afternoon when two Tampa Bay television stations gave defense lawyers copies of E-mail messages from a man who said a juror, Ms. Byrd, had discussed the jury's deliberations with a friend.,Lawyers for Mr. Lyons and Ms. Edwards requested a mistrial. But the trial judge, Susan Schaeffer, skeptical that something as flimsy as a mysterious E-mail message could negate a jury's verdict, questioned Ms. Byrd.,''No, m'am,'' Ms. Byrd said, when asked whether she had discussed the case. Later, she told reporters, ''I didn't do any of that.'',It was just the latest development in a case that often strayed outside the norm of criminal cases.,Specifically, the two defendants were charged on a single count of racketeering, involving several instances, prosecutors said, in which they promised to sell bogus lists and access to the National Baptist Convention's supposed membership of 8.5 million. Prosecutors said the figure was probably closer to 1 million.,Mr. Lyons was also charged with grand theft, with stealing most of about $240,000 donated to his organization by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money that was supposed to be distributed to black churches that had been destroyed by arson.,It was a trial in which the name of God was invoked again and again, mostly by lawyers for Mr. Lyons and Ms. Edwards, whom they described as His servants.,But as the two defendants tried to cloak themselves in religion, and as their lawyers tried to convince jurors that when money was floated into his personal account, it was just the way that black churches ''do business,'' prosecutors hammered again and again at their credibility with bank statements, letters and other hard evidence.,Throughout the trial, prosecutors documented specific instances of what they said was theft. The prosecution produced two letters from  Mr. Lyons to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, falsely reporting that the money it had donated to the burned black churches had been distributed.,Prosecutors produced a document in which the National Baptist Convention had estimated its state-by-state membership -- a list that Mr. Lyons had used in his scheme, the prosecution said. In some states, the organization reported a black membership that exceeded the number of black residents in those states.,But even as the documents and other evidence piled up around them, Mr. Lyons and his lawyers predicted that God would deliver him and Ms. Edwards from what they called the persecution of the state.,As the jury, five white women and one white man, began deliberations on Thursday afternoon, the two defendants and a group of about 25 close associates joined hands in the courthouse hallway and sang ''What a Friend We Have in Jesus.'' Then a supporter and member of the Baptist organization, the Rev. Charles Emery of Gary, Ind., led the group in a rousing prayer.,''Our Father, we need your intervention,'' Mr. Emery said, asking  God to help the jury make the ''right'' verdict.,''We need you to work on their hearts,'' he said as the people in the circle shouted ''Yes, Jesus!'' and one man loudly stomped his feet. ''We need you to work on their minds.'',Then, as tears filled the eyes of some in the circle, Mr. Emery made a prediction: ''We claim the victory right here.'',When he was done, Mr. Lyons's wife, Deborah, hugged a weeping Ms. Edwards. It was Mrs. Lyons who began the investigation into her husband's business dealing and lavish life style, when, in July 1997, she set fire to a $700,000 waterfront home he had bought with Ms. Edwards. Mrs. Lyons was convicted of arson and was sentenced to probation.,Later, Mrs. Lyons would say she did not suspect her husband of having an affair with Ms. Edwards and stood by her husband throughout the trial. Ms. Edwards denied having had an affair with Mr. Lyons.,Others stood by him, as well. His church, Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church in nearby St. Petersburg, retained him as pastor, and leaders in the National Baptist Convention voted to keep him as president, even as some members worried that he would drag the organization's reputation down with him.",RICK BRAGG,"FEB. 28, 1999",Top Baptist Official Is Guilty of Stealing And Business Fraud,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/top-baptist-official-is-guilty-of-stealing-and-business-fraud.html
"The eighth highest point in Manhattan is about to disappear.,With a bit of a flourish and more than a bit of wrangling, a 180-foot-long boom -- a steel structure almost the length of a city block -- was scheduled to be lowered early this morning to 42d Street from the tower crane atop 4 Times Square, the Conde Nast building. That is, wind and weather permitting.,Since last summer, when the crane finished climbing to the top of the 51-story tower it helped build, the boom tip has been been poised nearly 900 feet over Times Square, becoming a point on the skyline almost rivaling the Citicorp Center.,By the end of next week, if all goes as planned, not a trace will remain of the crane, which is worth about $1 million.,Its removal answers a question that has puzzled many New Yorkers about tower cranes: once a building is built, just how are the cranes taken down?,The answer -- besides ''very carefully'' -- turns out to be straightforward. The tower crane is used to erect a smaller crane, called a stiff-leg derrick, on the rooftop. The tower crane is broken down, and the derrick lowers it to the street in stages, starting with the boom.,Then the derrick is taken apart into pieces that can fit into a hoist or freight elevator. Down it goes to the ground, and off to the next job.,The public rarely witnesses these operations because they are scheduled at night or on weekends when there is the least traffic.,At 4 Times Square, there is a bit of a hitch because of the complex, constricted nature of the rooftop.,''We don't have room on the roof to lay the boom down and disassemble it,'' said Mel Ruffini, a vice president of the Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction manager. ''That's why it's being brought down in one section.'',Mr. Ruffini said wind would be a critical factor in deciding whether to proceed. If the maneuver is postponed, it will be put off until next Sunday, since 42d Street will have to be closed temporarily.,Four Times Square is an especially sensitive site because there have been construction accidents there, including a catastrophic collapse of a subcontractor's scaffolding in July. Thereza Feliconio, 85, was killed as pieces of steel crashed into her room in the Woodstock Hotel across the street. Times Square was snarled for days, and one block of 43d Street was closed for a month.,The tower crane has not been implicated in the accidents, however. And city officials and industry executives said tower cranes have a good record overall. The more frequently reported accidents involve mobile cranes at street level or smaller, unlicensed derricks. In January 1998, for example, a smaller 40-foot crane at the site fell while lifting a load of granite.,''We very rarely have a problem with a tower crane,'' said Gaston Silva, the city's Buildings Commissioner. ''In general, the tower cranes are very safe.'',Tower cranes are operated by licensed riggers. The cranes and derricks division of the Buildings Department reviews the assembly and dismantling procedures and also inspects the equipment before and after it is erected.,''Tower cranes, because they're larger, heavier and more complicated, are treated more carefully,'' said Jay P. Shapiro, principal engineer at Howard I. Shapiro & Associates, a structural engineering firm specializing in cranes and derricks. ''For the volume of construction and the number of cranes in use, it's remarkable how few accidents there are.'',Two tower cranes were used to build 4 Times Square: a Favco 1500 with a 181-foot boom and an FMC TG1900 with a 180-foot boom and a 10-foot extension. Both are owned by the Canron Construction Corporation, the structural steel subcontractor. The Conde Nast building is being developed by the Durst Organization and was designed by Fox & Fowle.,The cranes climbed upward through the building as it rose, lifting themselves from floor to floor. In April, the TG1900 took down the Favco and continued its ascent, reaching its high point in June.,All told, the TG1900 made 250 to 300 ''picks,'' as the lifting maneuver is called, handling steel girders, facade panels and cooling and heating equipment. Its last big job was on Feb. 8, when it hoisted an emergency generator to the rooftop.,Early last week, the tripod-like derrick was built. It sits on the rooftop, as green and angular as a giant praying mantis.,The derrick has four cables and can hoist a 35-ton load. The boom of the tower crane, the heaviest load that the derrick will handle, weighs 17 tons. Elio Cettina, the general superintendent of the 4 Times Square project for Tishman, said workers stationed in the street would use long lines to keep the crane boom from swinging during its journey down.,After the boom is lowered, the rest of the crane will follow over four or five days: the gantry, mast, counterweights and mechanical deck, including the winch and operator's cab. The crane will be taken to a yard in South Plainfield, N.J., for refurbishing.,Where will it go next?,Although cranes are often shipped cross country and sometimes overseas, this particular TG1900 will probably be used to construct 3 Times Square, the Reuters building, for which Tishman is also the construction manager.,''Unless there's a prior commitment,'' Mr. Cettina said, ''it will come back to Times Square in the middle of the summer.''",DAVID W.

"DREAMLAND,By Kevin Baker.,519 pp. New York:,HarperCollins Publishers. $26.,KEVIN BAKER'S jampacked novel of New York City circa 1910 rushes between lower Manhattan and Coney Island like a wild amusement-park ride on a continuous loop. The author shanghais all sorts of real-life Tammany pols, Bowery gangsters, factory girls and carnival attractions to join his own inventions inside a book that teems with violence, humor, information and hustle. ''Dreamland'' is historical fiction at its most entertaining and, in a number of spots, most high-handed.,The novel's whirligig of plots more or less all proceed from an incident that follows a heavily bet dog-and-rat fight in a basement off Baxter Street. Kid Twist incurs the lasting enmity of his fellow gangster Gyp the Blood when he hits Gyp with a shovel in order to save a newsboy (or so he thinks) from having his back broken across Gyp's knee. Now on the run from ''the most dangerous lunatic in New York,'' Kid soon makes matters much worse by romancing a girl he doesn't know is Gyp's sister Esther.,The little fellow Kid has saved is actually Trick the Dwarf, a performer at Coney Island's newest and most magical park, Dreamland. Trick sometimes likes to pass for a newsboy, since ''with a little makeup, I could not only hide my misshapen body, I could be young again. And what, after all, is the greater deformity -- size or age?'' In gratitude for his rescue from Gyp, Trick hides Kid Twist at Coney Island's Tin Elephant Hotel, where eventually Esther joins him. Trick himself is in love with the tiny, enchantingly mad Carlotta, whom he contrives to make queen of a built-to-scale Little City, the novel's version of Lilliput, a community of 300 midgets that actually existed in Dreamland.,Trying to overcome the same tenement life her brother escaped through crime, Esther first toils in a sweatshop, stitching sleeve linings for coats, and later takes a job at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory. With the encouragement of Clara Lemlich -- the bravest kochleffl (rabble-rouser) of all the young working women and a real-life activist who can be found in histories of the great Triangle fire -- Esther is transformed from wage slave to agitator.,Lumbering between the worlds of labor and crime and amusement is Big Tim Sullivan, the sentimental political boss and investor in Coney Island. A builder of the crude ethnic bridges that would create the city's modern body politic (''Big Tim's specialty had always been Jews''), Sullivan pushed through labor reforms and the famous law against concealed weapons that bears his name even as he stole elections and -- as Baker has it -- stood behind the famous murder of the gambler Herman Rosenthal, for which the police lieutenant Charles Becker was eventually executed.,''Dreamland'' is terrific fun, though ultimately something less than the sum of its gaudy episodes. Its gangland and labor narratives tend to move in more predictable increments than the action out at Coney Island; Trick, the only character whose tale gets told in the first person, becomes the most real and affecting one in the novel. The book's best lines belong to him: ''Ours was the most credulous of ages, for everything came true.'' Baker manages to throw everything together for a fiery dual climax -- Dreamland and the Triangle factory both burned in 1911 -- but the 500-page ride to it provides a lot of bumps along with the thrills. Baker works his italicized refrains rather hard and occasionally seems to be blocking the movie instead of writing the book. Frequent interruptions to follow Freud and Jung on their roughly contemporaneous American travels add nothing.,Baker is also the author of ''Sometimes You See It Coming'' (1993), a delightful baseball novel with some of the same vividness and ramshackle construction displayed by ''Dreamland.'' He has more recently worked as Harold Evans's chief researcher on ''The American Century,'' an experience that no doubt helped him stuff his new book with all its song and food and spectacles.,In a concluding note on his sources, Baker offers a modest manifesto for historical fiction, saying its essential obligations are to ''a good story,'' ''human nature'' and ''an essential core of truth'' -- which is to say, the forest of plausibility instead of every factual tree. He confesses to a number of chronological manipulations -- allowing, for instance, George McClellan, ''son of the famous Civil War flop by the same name,'' to preside as Mayor over the book's action, even though McClellan had left office before the novel's principal events occurred. Baker hopes that readers will ''amuse themselves sniffing out the real, unnamed, historical personages'' he has put into the narrative. Some readers may, but their amusement can only make them conscious of the author and his method; it will hardly keep their disbelief suspended.,All historical fiction requires manipulation and outright lying, but rearrangement of the public record on the scale conducted by Baker really makes for an allied genre one might call ''historical fantasy,'' a worthy but more perilous endeavor. Readers who don't know the history end up misinformed; those who do know it may end up irritated or perplexed.,Baker provides so much pleasure here that one hates to complain, but he might be better off with a clearer set of rules for himself. Naming a composite of ''the great Coney Island entrepreneurs'' after his brother-in-law (Matthew Brinckerhoff, acknowledged in the notes) is a charming self-indulgence, on the order of the inconspicuous self-image a cathedral sculptor puts amid the bigger gargoyles. Naming two Triangle factory foremen ''Kristol'' and ''Podhoretz'' is a lousy joke, and a sure-fire illusion killer for every scene in which the two appear.,The publicity for ''Dreamland'' inevitably pronounces it ''in the tradition of E. L. Doctorow's 'Ragtime.' '' I would venture to say, even with all the reservations above, that ''Dreamland'' is the better book. Its history and biography are less potted, and more often than not it truly inhabits its characters and era. There is a coldness to Doctorow's famous and much more pulled-together novel, a latter-day superiority that doesn't do emotional or moral justice to the period it's reconstructing. There's nothing arm's-length about Baker. He loves all the ''cigars, and oysters and roasting corn, the shady characters and the women of bad reputation'' he can crowd onto the page. ''Ragtime'' remains just that, a time, whereas Baker rightly tries to treat the past as a place, whose strange shoreline he's just sighted, like one of the startled immigrants in his bounteous book.",THOMAS MALLON,"FEB. 28, 1999",Time and Again,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/time-and-again.html

"JONATHAN SEGAL, an architect turned developer, says he builds ''affordable urban boxes.'' In the last eight years, when few others were building downtown, Mr. Segal completed seven of his small loft and row-house developments.,Mr. Segal's designs typically call for two-  to three-story stucco buildings, with compact living spaces, 18-foot ceilings, tall windows and ''garden'' patios. ''I'm not designing for families,'' said the 36-year-old Mr. Segal. ''I'm designing for hip, urban singles.'',He is one of a small group of architects building creative infill projects targeting younger residents who until recently couldn't afford to live in downtown San Diego.,Mr. Segal's most recently completed project is Kettner Row, 16 row houses in Little Italy, a 50-block neighborhood of warehouses, offices and small restaurants on San Diego Harbor. Called ''convertible housing,'' the project is designed to allow the owner to use the street level space as an office or studio.,The houses, with 1,280 to 1,800 square feet of space, sold as soon as they were finished in 1998 for prices ranging from $190,000 to $265,000. The residents, mostly 25 to 40 years old, include a lawyer, a real estate agent and an artist.,Scott Woods, a 38-year-old hotel consultant, rents one of the row houses for $1,400 a month. Tired of commuting, he moved downtown from the suburbs three years ago.,''I have one wall that's all glass,'' Mr. Woods said. ''I didn't expect to find something like this in the middle of the city.'',The redevelopment of Little Italy is an experiment for the city's redevelopment agency, the Centre City Development Corporation. It was the first time the agency had actively sought more than one developer for a large parcel. It approved a plan calling for seven architects to design six separate housing projects in a little more than one block.,However, with vacancy rates soaring and the area in a general recession in the mid-90's the agency couldn't find builders able to finance large projects downtown.,''We wanted to hit home runs during the recession with big projects, and it just wasn't going to happen,'' said Peter Q. Davis, chairman of the agency's board. ''So we had to go for singles.'',''Conventional wisdom,'' said Michael Stepner, a longtime city planner who is now dean of the New School of Architecture here,  explaining the redevelopment agency's yearning to tackle big projects, ''was that the only way to get something done was to take over an entire block and find one developer.'',To help spur the development of Little Italy, the agency offered developers discounts on city-owned land and it financed off-site improvements, including sidewalks.,Some local residents initially criticized the modern designs for not addressing the heritage of Little Italy, a community where Italian immigrants first settled at the turn of the century. But the architects argued that the area's roots were more closely linked to the fishing fleet, which was once based at the foot of the neighborhood.,''The last place I wanted to look for inspiration was Rome,'' said Ted Smith, one of the architects. ''I think the history of the area was smaller buildings oriented to the waterfront.'',Mr. Smith and his partner, Lloyd Russell, designed the Merrimac Building, a three-story work-living loft project on a 5,000-square-foot lot around the corner from Kettner Row. It also features a sharp box style, narrow spaces and tall windows.,Lofts of about 1,100 square feet in the Merrimac rent for $700 to $800 a month.,''They rented as soon as we put the sign out,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We could have built 50 and they would have rented.'',The tenants are primarily artists, architects and graphic designers who, like Mr. Smith, live and work in the building.,''Our interest as architects is to make spaces that are fun,'' Mr. Smith said,  ''things that typically the market doesn't pay for.'',BOTH Kettner Row and the Merrimac have won state and national design awards and praise from fellow architects. In 1998 an American Institute of Architects awards jury praised the new downtown residential developments as ''bold'' and ''energetic.'',''These designs are quite innovative,'' said Steven Ehrlich, a member of the jury panel and the principal in a Los Angeles architectural firm that bears his name. ''San Diego is on the cutting edge of multifamily residential urban design.'',The projects and others like them provide evidence that ''you can build to lower densities than is the practice and still make money,'' said Rob Wellington Quigley, an architect who has worked on several downtown projects. After several ''grim'' years, downtown is ''coming alive,'' he added.,Industry analysts say downtown is in the midst of a renaissance. With no large projects built in the last five years, the average resale price of condominiums downtown went from $248,000 to $401,000, according to Market Profiles of San Diego, a research firm.,Development of the Gaslamp Quarter,  with nightclubs and restaurants, helped bring new vibrancy to downtown's nightlife. A trolley system that began in 1981 links downtown to outlying areas, including the United States-Mexico border.,The city has done ''an extraordinary job'' redeveloping its downtown, ''particularly because they saw downtown as part of a regional complex,'' said Peter Calthorpe, an architect based in northern California who is a frequent lecturer on urban design issues.,In 1997 the first large supermarket opened downtown and last November voters approved a new hotel and baseball stadium complex for the southeastern corner of downtown. It will be home for the San Diego Padres.,''The decision to live downtown is much easier today than it was even five years ago,'' said Peter Reeb, a real estate analyst.,Real estate analysts talk about a phenomenon similar to ''a switch being flipped'' downtown, in terms of builder interest in developing residential units. In five years, the price of land in Little Italy has jumped from $25 to $75 a square foot, Mr. Smith said.,Mr. Segal has four downtown projects either under construction or approved by the city. One calls for one of the city's oldest taverns, the Waterfront bar in Little Italy, to be incorporated into a loft project.,All of Mr. Segal's new projects -- except for a three-unit development that will include his own residence -- are designed to rent. The vacancy rate for downtown rental units 2.3 percent, according to the San Diego County Apartment Association.,''The time's right for rentals; all the moons are aligned,'' Mr. Segal said.,Mr. Davis of the redevelopment agency said downtown was entering a new era in residential development.,''In the first 22 years of redevelopment we did 4,000 residential units, and we'll probably do 4,000 in the next five years,'' Mr. Davis said.,His agency is now reverting to its old strategy, once again looking for developers willing to take over an entire block.,''Now there seems to be a ton of developers willing to take on a full block,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Right now we're filling up a lot of residential needs and we're doing it with larger projects.'',Last year, his agency put out a request for proposals to redevelop 12 sites in the waterfront Marina District, the southwest corner of downtown near the San Diego Convention Center. A few years ago such a an announcement would have attracted little attention. This year more than 30 proposals were received.,Eventually, the redevelopment agency chose eight commercial and residential plans including several covering entire blocks. The projects, which are expected to be completed over the next three years, will add 1,157 apartments and for-sale units to the existing 7,900 units downtown, according to Market Profiles of San Diego.",KEVIN BRASS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Thinking Small in San Diego's Little Italy Enclave,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/thinking-small-in-san-diego-s-little-italy-enclave.html

"When Sally Maughan steps into a large fenced area in her backyard here, eight orphan bear cubs pay her the ultimate compliment.,''They treat me like a bear,'' said Ms. Maughan, who can lumber about in pretty convincing fashion. ''When I come in the door, they're thinking that way. They'll take a swat at me. They'll grab my shirt sleeve like it's the scruff of another bear.'',And that is the whole point, for Ms. Maughan is doing all she can to get these bears back into the wild this spring. Idaho wildlife officials call her ''the bear lady,'' and for the last 10 years she has been the volunteer in charge of an unusual program intended to return orphaned cubs to the wilderness.,Left on their own after their mothers are killed, usually in an illegal hunt or sometimes by a passing truck on a remote highway, young bears will almost surely die, because they cannot forage or otherwise fend for themselves in the first months of life. Some are brought to Ms. Maughan so young that she has to bottle-feed them every two hours.,''She basically teaches them how to be bears,'' explained Kris Van Cleave, a spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.,So far, Ms. Maughan, a 52-year-old travel agent, has returned 37 black-bear cubs to wilderness areas across Idaho and in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, and wildlife officials in charge of the releases say follow-up observations and checks of radio tags indicate that nearly all have done just fine.,In perhaps the greatest testament to her success, only one of the bears has shown an inclination to wander back to areas of human habitation like campgrounds in search of food. (That bear was ultimately deemed a ''nuisance bear'' and sent away to a university research project.),''Sally's very good at what she does,'' said Jeff Rohlman, a regional wildlife manager for the Fish and Game Department. ''She's good at minimizing contact, at keeping the cubs somewhat leery of humans, and that's exactly what you want to do with these bears.'',For Ms. Maughan, the process is something of a conundrum, since even as she devotes so many hours to the cubs and develops an obvious affection for them, the last thing she would ever want to do is treat them like pets.,''That's not the point at all,'' she said. ''If you get too emotionally attached, you'll wind up defeating everything you're working towards. A bear wants to be free. A bear needs to be free.'',What she feels when watching the bears successfully scamper off into the wild is a bit akin to the intensely mixed emotions, the pride and the sadness, that many parents experience when their children head off to college.,In fact, ''bear cubs go through comparable stages of development to children,'' Ms. Maughan said, ''except that it happens over a period of months, not years.'',Until the age of 8 weeks or so, the cubs are bawling infants, in need of a lot of nurturing, closeness, security, food and sleep.,After that, ''they begin about a month of the terrible 2's,'' she said, when ''they need supervision, they throw their own version of temper tantrums, they want what they want when they want it.'',By about 6 months, the teen-age stage has arrived. ''They get a bit wild and reckless,'' she said. ''They don't use good judgment, and seem to feel invincible.'',And then, at last, as they near the point of their release, ''you can breathe a sigh of relief,'' Ms. Maughan said.,''Now it's almost like having a college student around,'' she said. ''They take an interest in their surroundings and start to investigate and really try to figure out what makes everything tick.'',Of course, she cannot be exactly sure of all those equivalents, she said with a laugh, since she herself never reared any children.,''I never wanted to have kids,'' said Ms. Maughan, who never married, either. ''I'm really not a people person. Let's just say I'm more of a bear person.'',Ms. Maughan lives in this Boise suburb with her 85-year-old mother, also named Sally, 18 cats (at last count), 2 coyotes (Pouncer, 10, and Sparkle, 8, who have successfully acted as foster parents to several orphaned pups in a program that returns coyotes to the wild as well) and a good 75 or so stray ducks.,''She's just been this way ever since she was a little girl,'' her mother said. ''She'd come home from school, and there'd be four or five dogs following her.'',In past years, Ms. Maughan has spent as much as $6,000 of her own money on the bears, which have a voracious appetite for a diet that includes dog food, fish, fruit (especially apples and frozen grapes), carrots, acorns, bees, wasps and, she said, ''an occasional mouse who tries to join the picnic.'',Ms. Maughan has never been injured by any of her bears. The closest she ever came was when one of the cubs, nicknamed Griz, grew agitated one day and gave her, well, a real bearhug. But he eventually let go, and she was fine.,Every orphaned bear that is rescued and makes it back to the wild is a bear that in the past would have either died in the wild or most likely been put to death if found by wildlife officials. While black bears are common in many states, and while the North American population is not considered to be endangered, animal experts say Ms. Maughan's work should be applied to bear species around the world that are. Her nonprofit foundation recently received a $6,000 grant from the World Society for the Protection of Animals, based in London.,''On a global basis, there's no one doing what she's doing as well as she's doing it,'' said Chris Morgan, a bear specialist with the society. ''There's a lot to learn from her.'',Tara Wertz, regional wildlife habitat biologist with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, who has brought cubs to Ms. Maughan, said: ''As far as we're concerned, she's a godsend. You know, there just aren't a lot of people out there you can call on to take in a bear.''",SAM HOWE VERHOVEK,"FEB. 23, 1999","For Orphaned Little Cubs, a Den Mother",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/us/for-orphaned-little-cubs-a-den-mother.html

"AS every Wall Street firm struggles to figure out how to play the Internet, an advantage may lie with those that, like a fresh recruit to a midnight poker game, have yet to put their chips on the table.,Unlike its chief rivals, Goldman, Sachs & Company has never been a retail brokerage firm, meaning that it does not have an army of brokers selling stock to the public. Only a year ago, Goldman was seen as lagging so far behind Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch in the lucrative retail business that it risked becoming a niche player in financial markets. The Internet could change all that.,Goldman is now actively studying ways to become a retail broker using the Internet, people close to the firm said. One way would be to work out a joint venture with an on-line brokerage firm, possibly FMR's Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, or E*Trade. Another way would be to create its own on-line brokerage offering.,But the people close to the firm dismissed as highly unlikely the possibility that Goldman would buy E*Trade or another publicly traded on-line leader, saying that sky-high stock market valuations of Internet companies rule out a purchase of that kind.,The strategy discussions are taking place as Goldman itself prepares to go public, reviving a plan that was shelved last September amid world financial market turmoil. Unless the United States stock market undergoes a serious correction, Goldman will likely issue shares as early as late April, people at Goldman said.,Going public and developing a strategy for the Internet are seen as separate but related activities, Goldman executives said. One said the firm intended to have a clear Internet strategy in place when it begins marketing shares to investors, especially given the intense enthusiasm displayed by investors for Internet-related stocks in recent weeks. Also, Goldman could use its stock as a currency to make acquisitions or enter alliances after going public.,''Investors are going to ask about the Internet,'' said one person familiar with Goldman's strategy discussions. ''You can't hem and haw and say you're thinking about it. They will want to know exactly what you're doing and you want to be able to tell them.'',Goldman is not the first Wall Street firm to take the Internet seriously. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber, three leading brokerage firms with big retail operations, have all offered some Internet services for their customers. But Goldman's situation is intriguing to many in the industry precisely because the firm does not have a major retail operation -- and can thus change its strategy and enter a new business without spending heavily to build up a traditional network of retail brokers.,In fact, several Goldman executives spoke with evident relish about the delicate task facing Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Those two rivals must balance the interests of their thousands of retail brokers, most of them paid through commissions earned when they trade stocks for their clients, with the growing promise of Internet trading that largely eliminates the role of the traditional broker. Goldman calls this a ''channel conflict,'' and says it provides firms without a significant number of retail brokers a chance to challenge established competitors.,''Warfare used to be who had the biggest infantry,'' said the person familiar with Goldman's strategy talks.''You had to feed and clothe those guys and they died for you on the front lines. Now you don't need to be in the infantry business at all. We have smart bombs.'',Leslie Tortora, Goldman's head of global technology, and Larry Buchalter, managing director in the firm's fixed-income division, are heading a new committee to study the matter. The committee met for the first time only a week ago and it seems unlikely to reach a recommendation immediately, people close to the situation said. The existence of the committee was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.,Goldman has already dipped its toes in Internet waters. It has reserved blocks of shares of companies it underwrites for distribution to retail investors through E*Trade, a leader among the dozens of existing on-line trading firms. Both Goldman and E*Trade are also partners in an electronic stock trading network called Archipelago.,E*Trade's share price rose $8.4375, or 20 percent, to $48.5625, in trading yesterday on speculation that it would seal a fresh alliance with Goldman.,But while people close to Goldman do not rule out new links to E*Trade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., they played down their relationship with the company. E*Trade has overemphasized ties with Goldman in news releases, one Goldman executive said. The executive said that such releases might have given the impression that Goldman had chosen E*Trade as its main on-line partner, an impression he said was inaccurate.,On the contrary, Goldman is still debating how best to deploy one of its potential on-line aces: its stock research. Goldman has talked with both Fidelity and Schwab as well as E*Trade about distributing Goldman research.",JOSEPH KAHN,"FEB. 23, 1999","THE MARKETS: Market Place; Goldman, Sachs is a latecomer to selling stocks on the Internet, which may end up an advantage.",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/business/markets-market-place-goldman-sachs-latecomer-selling-stocks-internet-which-may.html

Such orders are placed to protect against losses if a currency moves contrary to expectations.,The dollar's yen losses were tempered in afternoon trading by a rally in United States stocks and as bonds gained.,In other trading, the euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar since the single currency's inception in January on expectations that slow growth in Europe would prompt the European Central Bank to reduce interest rates.,The euro fell to $1.1024, from $1.1069 Friday, dropping as low as $1.0962 earlier.

"LAST year's tax season was not a pretty one for Michael Grande. Oh, he faced no major hurdles, no unexpected penalties or audits; it's just that he ended up shelling out ''north of 20 grand.'' He had expected to pay about $18,000, but he is an active investor and had a good a year in the market.,Mr. Grande, who is single, makes upward of $100,000 a year in salary and bonuses; he contributes to his 401 (k) plan, now amounting to $100,000 spread among three mutual funds, and invests nearly $25,000 a year in stocks. So he has a substantial income that he has not offset with deductions. For example, he rents an apartment in Manhattan, so he can't claim a deduction on a mortgage.,''There's no way for me to take any more deductions,'' said Mr. Grande, 31, a senior underwriter at Fleet Bank in New York, expressing a view shared by many ambitious young professionals.,Ah, but there are routes to tax relief. Susan Feitelberg, a Manhattan financial adviser, says Mr. Grande -- and many younger people like him -- could take several steps toward long-term financial security while lowering their tax bills. The moves could be particularly important for Mr. Grande, because he has a lofty goal: He wants to retire at 50.,For starters, Ms. Feitelberg recommended that Mr. Grande open a Roth I.R.A. His contributions, although not tax-deductible,  could grow tax-free for many years and be withdrawn tax-free during retirement. Because he already contributes to his employer's retirement plan and his income is above $40,000, he is not eligible for a traditional, deductible I.R.A.,''The Roth I.R.A. is great,'' Ms. Feitelberg said. ''It allows people with higher incomes to put more away.'' Single people can contribute $2,000 to a Roth if their adjusted gross income is below $95,000, and smaller contributions are allowed with incomes of up to $110,000; for married taxpayers the limits are $150,000 to $160,000. ''And you don't have to make the mandatory distribution at the age of 70 1/2, as you do with the traditional,'' Ms. Feitelberg said.,There are other benefits, too. After the account has been open for five years, Mr. Grande could withdraw as much principal as he likes for any purpose, without penalty, making Roths much more flexible than traditional I.R.A.'s. In addition, there are special breaks for withdrawals put toward qualified education expenses and first-time home buying, though with a $10,000 lifetime cap.,Moreover, the failure to contribute $2,000 now could cost him a lot more by retirement, considering the tax-free growth of a Roth account. ''By your late 20's you want to be putting away 10 percent of your income toward retirement -- I can't stress that enough,'' she said. ''Say you're 30, and you start putting $2,000 a year into an I.R.A. and you do that until you're 65. If you get a 10 percent return, you'd have a total of $244,692. But if you start investing at 31, you only get $224,566 -- a loss of $20,126. If you wait five more years, it's an $86,000 loss.'' For Mr. Grande, an avid competitor in triathlons -- which involve swimming, cycling and running -- that's a lot of bicycles.,Ms. Feitelberg also suggests that he make the maximum contribution to his 401 (k) -- 15 percent of his salary, in his case. (He currently contributes 12 percent, and his company matches his contributions dollar for dollar.),''The key is participation and understanding the types of funds you can choose,'' she continued. ''So many people I talk to randomly pick percentages and lose a lot of potential money by not understanding the funds they're in. To me, this is the most overlooked area of financial and tax planning.,''Let's say Mike maxes his 401 (k)'' at the $10,000 allowed by law, she said. His real cost is $6,150, since he's in the 38.5 percent tax bracket, considering Federal, state and city taxes. Then the employer's contribution comes on top of that. ''That's pretty awesome,'' she said.,MR. GRANDE could also itemize deductions on his tax return, rather than take the standard deduction, which is $4,250 for single filers. If he itemized, Ms. Feitelberg said, he could claim ''about $10,500 in state and local taxes, $2,500 in charitable gifts, and $1,900 in miscellaneous deductions -- close to $15,000 in itemized deductions'' -- more than three times the standard deduction.,For the last seven years, Mr. Grande has sponsored a road race in Norwalk, Conn., in conjunction with the United Way. The project costs him about $250, but he has never claimed it as a charitable gift. Nor has he deducted his miscellaneous expenses -- unreimbursed employee expenses like business-related calls made at home, professional dues and publications or business gifts; tax preparation fees; investment software, and safety deposit box rental.,Finally, there is the delicate matter of buying a home. Mr. Grande now pays rent of $1,024 a month for an Upper East Side alcove studio, which he shares with his snowshoes and three bicycles. He's financially savvy enough to know the tax benefits of buying versus renting -- buyers can deduct real estate taxes and mortgage interest, whereas renters have no deductions -- but ''I'm not sure if it makes sense,'' he said. ''Should I buy a condo or co-op, or am I getting more appreciation from my investments?'',Buy, Ms. Feitelberg advised. ''Single New Yorkers are more likely to delay buying because of their circumstances rather than their cash,'' she said, breaking down those circumstances into career (''What if my job changes?''); companion (''What if I meet someone?'') and commitment fears (''Uh-oh, now I'm locked in.''),''Financially, your life is always changing, but there's only so much you can control,'' she said. ''In the city especially, real estate and the stock market often go hand in hand, and your investments in either will likely move in similar directions.'',If, for example, Mr. Grande put down $45,000 for a $225,000 apartment, he could save about $5,800 a year in taxes. (The downside is that he would have to sell some investments to come up with the down payment and would be liable for taxes on the resulting capital gains.),But there can be a big tax break later. If he buys the apartment and lives in it for two or more years, as a single person he could take appreciation of up to $250,000 tax free when he sells it.,Besides, Ms. Feitelberg said, buying an apartment can only enhance his quality of life. ''If he buys, he can get the tax break and a few hundred more square feet,'' she says. ''Mutual funds can't provide room for bikes and snowshoes.''",ABBY ELLIN,"FEB. 28, 1999","YOUR TAXES; Young and Single, and Wanting Some Tax Relief",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-young-and-single-and-wanting-some-tax-relief.html
"AROUND report card time, there is no anxiety in the Brooklyn household of Lincoln and Marlene Nixon. Their son, Khari, 7, always has high marks and is ranked in the top percentile in both reading and math.,But the Nixons do feel anxiety about the tax season, because of the usual bill from Uncle Sam; it averages roughly $1,000 a year, on top of the taxes withheld from their paychecks. The tax liability often makes it tough to save for their children's education. They would like to increase the monthly allotment for a fund they set up for their son's college education and to begin a similar fund for their daughter, Kamila, 4.,''We realize we have to do something now,'' said Mr. Nixon, a manager for an industrial company who came to this country from the Caribbean island of Dominica 20 years ago.,The Nixons recently bought a $300,000 brownstone in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, and they expect the deductions for mortgage interest and real estate taxes to reduce their tax bill this year. But home ownership has brought other expenses, so the Nixons remain worried about meeting their goals for college savings.,''We don't want our kids to have to struggle'' to get an education, said Marlene Nixon, a registered nurse who immigrated from Grenada 23 years ago, adding that she and her husband ''did not have a foundation much like a child who was born here, whose parents may have been born here, who inherited assets.'',The 1998 tax year offers new possibilities for families like the Nixons. They can contribute, for example, to the New York State college savings plan, which started last year. It lets them set aside $5,000, free of state taxes, in a tuition savings account administered by T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F.  When the money is eventually paid out for education, Federal taxes on the income are due at the student's rate, which generally will be lower than the parents'.,''This is one of the best ways to save, because you get a state tax break and deferral on the Federal,'' said Alfred G. Osbourne, a senior financial adviser for American Express. ''I recommend this to all my clients who live in New York State.'',The Nixons, whose annual income is $120,000, also qualify for an Education I.R.A., which allows joint filers with modified adjusted gross income of up to $150,000, phasing out at $160,000, to set aside $500 a year for each child under 18 for education bills. While the initial contribution is not deductible, distributions are tax-free if used for qualified education expenses, meaning that there is no tax on the income earned.,''They are not going to generate that much money, since you can only put away $500 a year,'' said David Roy Eaton, president of the Eaton Group, a financial and estate consulting firm in New York, who does not recommend this option to clients. ''I think it is ridiculous legislation,'' he said. ''For an American who wants to send their child to a very good school, it's an embarrassment.'',THE Nixons have heeded Mr. Eaton's advice, bypassing the Education I.R.A. Instead, they give $121 a month to their son through a Uniform Gift to Minors Account invested in the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund, which produced a 34.76 percent return last year. The first $700 of earnings is tax-free; the next $700 is taxed at the child's rate, and anything over that is taxed at the parents' rate. Once Khari reaches 14, everything will be taxed at his rate.,Mr. Osbourne recommends that families choosing this option select growth funds that do not pay much in dividends and capital gains but have ''strong growth potential,'' so that the bulk of the taxable income will come after the child reaches 14.,The Nixons are not saving enough to afford the expected $174,121 cost of tuition, room and board for a four-year education at a private institution in 2010, when Khari is expected to be in college. Costs at public college would average $81,000, Mr. Osbourne said. He advises that parents hoping to send their children to a private school begin saving $447 a month at birth -- or $210 a month for a public college. Judging from Khari's academic performance so far, ''he'll probably choose a private school,'' Mrs. Nixon said.,THE couple established Khari's college fund when he was 4, and they hope to start a fund for Kamilia before the end of the year. The Nixons, who are also paying $11,000 a year to send their two children to the private Cush Campus Schools in Brooklyn, say they know they will have to increase saving to provide for college.,But they are still ahead of most middle-class families, who generally do not start saving for college until their children are in high school --  much too late, according to Mr. Eaton.,''We don't have a lavish life style,'' Mr. Nixon said. ''We stick to the basics, if you look at what we are doing. My children will go to the best possible college to provide them with the best possible education'' -- he paused -- ''that we can afford.''",DAVID J.

"A SELF-EMPLOYED publicist,  Shari L. Goldstein began building her business in the spring of 1996, when the older of her two sons turned 6. ''I started in a corner nook in my former husband's law office,'' Ms. Goldstein said. ''But it's a busy place, so I eventually rented a small office in Huntington,''  N.Y., near her home in Jericho on Long Island. ''Through word of mouth, the business developed.'',Later Ms. Goldstein, 40, like a growing number of entrepreneurs and consultants, moved her office to her home, giving herself the full array of tax traps and opportunities faced by the self-employed. The move occurred last September, when she and her husband were negotiating an amicable divorce; they agreed that he would get the law practice and she would get their home.,She moved the business into the home office for both personal and financial reasons.,''My kids were starting more after-school programs, and I knew that I'd have to do a lot more running around,'' she said. ''Working at home gives me more flexibility and more time,'' she said, although she still works more than 40 hours a week. In addition, the move saved money by eliminating rental payments and created tax savings.,Unlike many other start-up businesses, Ms. Goldstein's has always turned at least a small annual profit. So she never had to deal with an Internal Revenue Service policy, called the ''hobby loss'' rule, that generally prevents people from deducting expenses in a business that is unprofitable for 3 out of 5 years. The I.R.S. often construes small money-losing businesses as hobbies, not commercial ventures.,A talkative, outgoing woman, Ms. Goldstein worked in advertising and public relations before having children. She had enjoyed the publicity business but wanted to strike out on her own.,Like many business owners, she outfitted her office with a computer, a printer, a fax machine and two phone lines. Under Section 179 of the tax code, she was able to deduct the entire cost of the equipment in 1997, the year she bought it -- rather than depreciate it and take the deductions over several years. (For 1998 returns, business equipment worth up to $18,500 can be deducted in the year it was bought.),But she missed out on another tax break for self-employed people by not setting up a Keogh tax-deferred retirement plan for herself.,''The business was just starting out, and there wasn't much money around,'' she said. Besides, she said, she was married at the time, and ''I didn't think that it was necessary.'',Ms. Goldstein, whose clients are professionals, authors and companies, including Arthur Murray International Inc. and Chiron Associates,  reported her business income and expenses on Schedule C of the joint tax return she filed with her husband.,The couple plan to file their final joint tax return in April. After that, Ms. Goldstein will file her own return.,''He's in a significantly higher tax bracket,'' she said. They are ''paying taxes at a rate of 40 percent, which kills me,'' she said. ''I'm looking forward to stopping that.'',As part of the divorce settlement, her former husband will pay her health insurance premiums until her alimony ends in the summer of 2000. At that point, as a self-employed entrepreneur, she will be able to deduct 60 percent of her premiums; by 2003, they will be fully deductible.,She expects her business, which she runs as a sole proprietorship, to earn $50,000 this year. Has she thought about incorporating the business? ''The amount that I would pay to incorporate would negate the tax benefits,'' she said. She figures that incorporating would cost her $2,000 a year in legal and accounting fees, plus the time needed to complete the extra filings for taxes and the Department of Labor.,Having dealt with the tax consequences of divorce and self-employment, in August she faced another major event with tax implications. Shortly before she moved her office into her home, she received a phone call from her uncle. Her mother, who had moved to Florida when she was widowed three years earlier, had been killed in a car accident in a small town in Mississippi while returning from her new boyfriend's Army reunion. And so Ms. Goldstein took on a new role: executor of her mother's estate.,''First, I had to find out what and where everything was,'' she said. She and her brother flew to Florida. ''My aunt found a file, but then we had to play detective. Then we found a list of assets, neatly written out and updated every six months. My father had started tracking their investments and mutual funds in 1985. My brother and I sat down with three massive boxes and sorted everything into piles.'',THE next day, the stock market dropped during the late-summer selloff. As executor, Ms. Goldstein chose to value the estate as of the day after death. The I.R.S. also permits executors to value an estate as of six months after the date of death.,To the surprise of Ms. Goldstein and her brother, their parents had saved a considerable amount of money. The estate was worth more than $800,000.,Her windfall comes with its own tax consequences. Starting this year, Ms. Goldstein will owe a tax on distributions made by the individual retirement accounts she inherited from her parents. But, in a sense, her business is coming to the rescue. To minimize the taxes she pays, she has decided to start that Keogh plan for her business income.",CAROLE GOULD,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR TAXES; Pitfalls and Benefits In the Home Office,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-pitfalls-and-benefits-in-the-home-office.html
"AH, retirement, and early retirement at that. Trips to Hawaii and Mexico. Lazy days restoring a sailboat.,These are some of the activities of Ken and Marilyn Rocky of Little Silver, N.J., who are now planning to travel to England, having just returned from Puerto Vallarta. They have started on a life of travel and a pursuit of their own interests -- and are loving it.,''In the back of my brain, I always figured that I would retire at 59,'' Mr. Rocky said. ''My definition of failure was to be still working at 60.'',By that definition, the Rockys are super successes. Mr. Rocky retired a year ago at age 55 from his job as a district manager for AT&T. Mrs. Rocky, who is the same age as her husband, runs her own business as a management consultant but has plenty of time to travel with her husband. They have no children.,Mr. Rocky took advantage of a company buyout; he took a lump-sum pension payment and rolled it over into an individual retirement account. He also got other goodies, like a year's salary. In addition, the Rockys have Mrs. Rocky's earnings, and the stock market has been relatively good to them.,On the advice of their accountant, Doug Stives of Curchin & Company in Red Bank, N.J., the Rockys have made some financial moves and are planning others to keep their taxes in retirement as low as possible. Tax laws affecting retirees were already complicated, and with new provisions in effect for 1998 returns, the situation is even more complex.,One of Mr. Stives's admonitions involves what assets to use for everyday living. ''The strong advice I try to give retirees is: Don't plan on living on those types of assets that are tax-deferred until after-tax assets have been exhausted'' -- especially for someone like Mr. Rocky, who is not yet 59 1/2 and could thus face a 10 percent early-withdrawal penalty, Mr. Stives said. Early retirees can arrange a penalty-free withdrawal from a retirement account before 59 1/2, but complex rules require a minimum five-year payout to avoid a 10 percent penalty.,The tax-deferred assets include I.R.A.'s and what are known as qualified plans -- that is, pension plans, 401(k)'s, Keogh plans and similar retirement plans. For the Rockys, Mr. Stives advises living on Mrs. Rocky's earnings and the money in their nondeferred savings and stock portfolio before withdrawing any money from the I.R.A.,The reason -- beyond any penalties -- is that when money is withdrawn from a tax-deferred account, taxes are due on the full amount as ordinary income. This can be taxed as high as 39.6 percent, although most taxpayers are in lower brackets. But for securities sold outside a tax-deferred plan, the tax rate on any capital gain is just 20 percent; in the 15 percent tax bracket, capital gains are taxable at only 10 percent.,''Rather than take money out of your pension plan, I'd argue it's better to sell off some of your Microsoft,'' Mr. Stives said. By law, an individual must start taking money out of qualified plans at age 70 1/2. Mr. Rocky is 15 years away from that. With careful planning, he could end up with four or five times what he now has in his I.R.A., Mr. Stives said.,The Rockys, of course, could run out of assets to finance their carefree retirement, but one help, Mr. Stives said, will be Social Security, which Mr. Rocky can start tapping at age 62. The Rockys may decide to defer  Social Security beyond age 62 to increase their monthly benefits. But part of their Social Security benefits will be taxable, subject to the amount of their other income.,At some point, the Rockys could sell their house and pocket a capital gain on it of any amount up to $500,000 without paying a cent in tax. Of course, they would have to buy or rent another place to live, perhaps a condominium or something smaller than their suburban home.,AS for the I.R.A. money, Mr. Stives hopes the Rockys will roll some of it over into a Roth account. This may be heresy to some, since Roth accounts are seen by many advisers as primarily for younger investors. Converting an I.R.A. into a Roth account makes one liable for taxes on the money converted -- but then it lets the account holder or a beneficiary withdraw the money tax-free, no matter how much it has grown. The fact that a retiree must find the money to pay the one-time tax bill gives people pause, especially because a provision that allows taxpayers to spread the tax bite over four years ended last Dec. 31.,People with adjusted gross incomes below $100,000 can take any chunk of I.R.A. money and roll it over into a Roth. The Rockys expect a gross income of $50,000 to $60,000 from Mrs. Rocky's earnings, their investment income and other sources. With deductions and exemptions, their taxable income may be about $25,000, putting them in the 15 percent tax bracket. They could have about $18,000 more in taxable income before being bumped up into the 28 percent bracket. Mr. Stives recommends that they fill up the 15 percent bracket by rolling over $18,000 of I.R.A. funds into a Roth I.R.A.,Unlike the funds in an ordinary I.R.A., the money in a Roth never has to be withdrawn. Roth money can be left to a spouse and children, and it continues to be free of income taxes.,Can other workers in their 50's do what the Rockys are doing? ''It is not always feasible,'' Mr. Stives said. ''We have a number of clients who come in and say they have accumulated a million bucks with equity in their house and stock winnings, and they think they can retire.,''They think that if they can get 7 percent on their money, they can live quite well,'' he added. ''They neglect to consider that equity in their house is not income-producing.'' He points out to them that they may live 40 or 50 years more and could use up their assets quickly. Retirees often don't realize that their spending may well increase after retirement, and that medical expenses can eat up life savings at the worst possible time.,''They are also forgetting inflation,'' he said. ''I can guarantee we'll see it one day again.,''The typical person is in some cases in a dream world because he made 30 percent on his stock portfolio, but you can't depend on that continuing,'' Mr. Stives added.,At the other extreme are people who avoid any investment risk and make 3 percent or so on their money. Mr. Stives favors a happy medium.,As for the Rockys, Mr. Stives said he thought they could make retirement work. If worse comes to worst, Mr. Rocky can always take another job. Indeed, he worked one day as a consultant, but that seems to have fulfilled his need for employment. ''Get over it,'' he told himself.",DANIEL F.

"KEEPING records of stock purchases and sales and completing the tax forms to report capital gains and losses are tricky enough for the average investor. But for day traders, who spend their days flipping stocks, and for a growing army of other investors who trade often, lured by the bull market and the ease of trading on line, compliance with tax reporting rules creates a mountain of paperwork.,Just ask John D. Rankin of Osprey, Fla., who spends 20 hours a week managing his portfolio. He figures he makes 150 to 300 trades annually.,''It's a tremendous task to put together all those capital gains,'' said Mr. Rankin, who, in addition to managing his investments, is working with his wife, Bobbie Walck, to refurbish a motor yacht that sleeps six.,He has even considered paring back his portfolio, which averages roughly 200 stocks, to alleviate the pain. Paying taxes is not the problem; he figures that is the price of successful investing. Rather, the headaches come from sorting through the folders and spreadsheets he keeps to document his stock trades.,''It becomes painful to compile all that information, and you just want to walk away from it,'' he said.,Mr. Rankin, 49, began investing in the stock market when he was 21. His initial stake: money that he earned selling newspapers and shares of Laclede Gas that his father had given him when he was 6 years old. After graduating from the University of Missouri with a bachelor's degree in business and public administration, he worked in his father's company, which distributes industrial products to the wholesale plumbing and drilling trades.,At the same time, he refined his trading technique by talking stocks with stockbroker friends over drinks after work. ''You look at P/E's and pricing, and you begin to learn,'' Mr. Rankin said. ''As you go through periods of good and bad investing, you ask yourself, how can I do better next time?'',BEFORE he turned 30, he took much more investing risk than he is willing to take today. ''Now I'm looking for ways to protect myself by looking at asset allocation, reviewing the fundamentals on particular issues and balancing sectors,'' he said.,He trades on line using Street Smart, an investing program from Charles Schwab & Company that lets him update stock prices daily and provides price charts and data like individual stocks' dividends and price-to-earnings ratios. The program also tracks his price per share, and calculates gross and net gains.,Mr. Rankin said he made about half his trades on the Internet, after using Yahoo to search for information on companies and their stocks.  ''The Internet lets me access information in a timely fashion,'' he said, adding, ''It's hard for individual investors to get economic access -- or even any access -- to information from Goldman, Sachs and other big brokers.'',He has accounts with three brokers: Schwab, Olde Discount Brokers and Stifel Nicolaus & Company, a full-service broker in St. Louis, where he lived until his brother bought him out of the family business in 1997. Stifel manages part of his holdings for a fee, and he also trades independently at the firm.,Stifel prepares a running monthly compilation of his short-term and long-term transactions, ''which helps me manage my capital gains,'' he said.,Dealing with three brokers means  triple record-keeping. ''I maintain a book of account for each brokerage account and files for each company that I trade with,'' he said. ''Every trade that I do is deposited in the files and then entered manually into my computer.'',At year-end, the paperwork multiplies. Stifel prepares separate capital gains schedules for each money manager with whom Mr. Rankin worked -- there were four in 1998. And Mr. Rankin maintains both taxable and tax-deferred accounts with some of the managers, which complicates the paperwork.,All his Schwab trades are automatically recorded by Street Smart; he manually enters his Olde transactions into that program, too. Then he checks data from Stifel and Street Smart against his own records. When he ascertains that everything is correct, Mr. Rankin, who prepares his own return using Turbotax, enters all sales on Schedule D.,After that, he does what any good taxpayer would do.

"For the first time in two decades, New York State environmental scientists have found that chemical contamination in striped bass from the lower reaches of the Hudson River has dropped to levels deemed safe to eat by the Federal Government.,In a study completed last week, staff scientists with the Environmental Conservation Department concluded that the drop was large enough for state officials to consider ending a 23-year-old ban on commercial netting of the fish, a state law that has nearly eliminated a centuries-old traditional springtime harvest of stripers and shad along the river banks.,Any change would take at least a couple of years, but commercial fishermen were delighted by the announcement.,The chemicals in question are PCB's -- polychlorinated biphenyls -- which were legally released into the river for three decades from General Electric factories north of Troy before they were banned in 1977 as a probable cause of cancer.,The study, of samples taken in the spring of 1997, showed that PCB's in fillets from striped bass captured in the lower river (where fresh water becomes salt water, typically around Catskill) averaged 1.06 parts per million, about half the Federal limit of 2 parts per million. Only 3.3 percent of the samples exceeded the limit, the study said.,In 1990, the PCB level in stripers was almost 3 parts per million; by 1994, it was down to 2 parts per million. Tests of 1998 samples will not be completed until April.,Dr. Ronald Sloan, a biologist for the Environmental Conservation Department and an author of the study, emphasized that PCB levels were below the Federal limit only in fish taken south of Poughkeepsie. Although the level in stripers from the river near Albany also dropped, it was not low enough to bring them under the Federal limit, he said. He added that other species did not show a similar decline.,Striped bass are less prone to absorb PCB's than other river fish because they spend part of each year at sea, he said. Shad have little exposure to PCB's because they only come to the Hudson to spawn. Fish that stay in the river -- largemouth bass, catfish, eels -- tend to have higher PCB levels, and remain above the limits.,State Health Department officials said the study would not lead to any immediate change in its health advisories, which warn people not to eat fish from the river south of Catskill more than once a month. North of Catskill, the state recommendation is that no fish of any kind be eaten.,But Dr. Sloan said the results should prompt state officials to consider ending the law banning commercial netting of stripers.,''PCB concentrations in striped bass have reached the point where continued limitations on the commercial fishery due solely to PCB's are not justified,'' the study concluded. ''At least for this species, the monitoring vigil over the last 25 years is starting to bear testimony to the fact that if a natural system stops being insulted, conditions will start to shift favorably.'',Robert Gabrielson, a commercial fishermen who has netted shad for 58 years near his home in Nyack, said, ''I've been waiting 23 years to hear something like this.'' Without the legal right to keep striped bass that wander into shad nets, shad fishing is almost impossible because of the work involved in keeping nets clear of bass, he said. ''When I had brown hair, there were 14 fishing camps in Nyack,'' said Mr. Gabrielson, who is 69. ''Now, I'm it.'',Whether there will be a next generation of fisherman is unclear. There is only a handful of commercial fishermen on the river these days. Mr. Gabrielson has two sons who fish with him now and he says the striped bass decision will largely determine whether they stay in the business.,The potential market is questionable. Bad associations will almost certainly keep ''Hudson striped bass'' off menus. But when the fish are caught off Long Island, they are often called ''wild striped bass,'' to distinguish them from ones from fish farms, and the label could fairly be applied to river fish.,Any decision on reopening the commercial striped bass fishery in the Hudson would be preceded by public hearings and would involve a multistate commission that sets limits for how many fish may be taken in each state along the Atlantic Coast, said Gerry Barnhart, the director of fish, wildlife and marine resources for New York's Environmental Conservation Department.,The PCB study was not expected to change state and Federal efforts to force General Electric to clean up the river banks and bottom downstream of its two factories, at Fort Edward and Hudson Falls, which released the PCB's while making electrical equipment.,Yesterday, state environmental officials released their proposal to stop the leakage of PCB's from contaminated soil at the Fort Edward factory. The plan includes excavating about 9,000 tons of tainted soil from the river bank and drilling wells to pump PCB-laden groundwater from beneath the factory grounds. The project is expected to cost General Electric about $9.4 million.,Ann Rychlenski, a spokeswoman for the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, said its scientists still expected to have their plan for cleaning the river below the factories ready by 2001.,''It's great that the fish further down appear to be cleaner, and one thing you certainly want to see is the return of the fishery,'' she said. ''But we still have a problem. And the further upriver you go, the worse it gets.'',David C. Warshaw, a spokesman for General Electric, said the results of the study were ''one more sign that the river's recovery is in full swing.'' General Electric paid part of the cost of the study, under its agreement to repay the state for the expenses of cleaning the river banks.,But John Waldman, a scientist who has studied striped bass for the Hudson River Foundation, a private environmental group in Manhattan, said, ''You would want to see numbers like this over two or three years before making a decision.'' He added that cleaning up bottom mud near the factories could temporarily stir up PCB's and raise concentrations. ''In that case, this would be a short-term tease, opening a fishery that would have to be closed again,'' he said.",ANDREW C.

"Levi Strauss & Company, an icon of popular American culture, said yesterday that it would close half of its manufacturing plants in the United States and Canada and ship much of the work overseas. The company will lay off 5,900 employees, or 30 percent of its North American work force.,The jeans maker, whose sales declined 13 percent last year, to $6 billion, said the move would allow it to compete more effectively with rivals that largely make their products overseas, where labor costs are cheaper, and to concentrate on improving the marketing of its jeans, which have been losing favor among younger consumers in recent years.,Founded during the California Gold Rush of the 1850's, Levi Strauss, based in San Francisco, eventually grew to be the largest maker of blue jeans in the world. And as jeans evolved from miners' gear into the outfit of movie star rebels and then suburban youth, Levi's became synonymous with American style. Now that style, which had once been manufactured entirely in the United States, will be stitched together largely overseas.,Perhaps complacent about its brand's place in the popular culture, Levi Strauss has not responded well to a wave of aggressive competition in recent years, and its jeans have lost some of their cachet. While Levi Strauss stayed committed to its five-pocket button-fly 501 jeans, which until recently were an integral item in any high school wardrobe, high-end designers like Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger carved out market share with fashionable bell-bottom and cargo-pants styles.,Midmarket retailers like Sears, Roebuck & Company and J. C. Penney have also taken a chunk of the giant's sales by introducing their own low-cost brands. Levi's jeans sell for an average of $45 a pair, sandwiched between designer brands at about $60 and mass-market brands for $25.,''We took our eye off the consumer, and we weren't as nimble as we should have been,'' Robert Haas, the company's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday.,Not all Levi's brands are moribund by any means. According to the company, which is privately owned and does not release profit figures, Dockers, its casual line of khakis, had a record year for both sales and earnings. Slates, a brand of dress pants, also had a strong year. But the core brand, Levi's, which accounts for some 70 percent of the business, is clearly slumping.,Levi Strauss still has plenty of loyal consumers among the baby boomers, ''but we focus on the teen-ager because they represent the next generation of jeans wearers and they tend to influence the broader market in terms of styles and trends,'' said Gavin Power, a Levi's spokesman.,The company had warned employees several weeks ago that cutbacks were imminent. Levi Strauss yesterday offered a package of benefits to its workers worth a total of about $245 million, including eight months' notice, three weeks of severance pay for every year of service and an allowance of up to $6,000 for each employee to pay for education and retraining costs.,Bruce Raynor, secretary-treasurer of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which represents many of the workers at Levi Strauss plants, said, ''As benefits packages go, this is as generous as it gets.'',This is the second round of layoffs for Levi Strauss, which closed 11 United States plants in 1997 and laid off 7,400 workers. But unlike the first round, which was intended to cut excess production, this cut heralds an effort to ship production overseas. Four plants in Texas, two in Tennessee and one each in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas and Ontario, will be closed. Mr. Power said the plants would probably be replaced by ''a network of contract facilities'' in the United States and Latin America.,Though most of its competitors long ago moved operations to Asia or Mexico, where labor costs are much lower, Levi Strauss, which likes to think of itself as a good corporate citizen, has clung to a century-old tradition of manufacturing, at least in part, in the United States.,Mr. Haas said the closings were a tacit acknowledgment that this tradition was no longer practical. ''Certain kinds of work are not going to continue to be done in America,'' he said. A conscientious employer can do best under these conditions, he said, by ''not denying reality, as we tried to do for too long, but by owning up to our obligations to the workers who've helped us grow and trying to do our best to help them move on.'',The company's troubles extend beyond just managing production costs, however. Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, said: ''Levi is one of best brand names in the world, but it has lost much of its potency over the last few years. Its core product has not changed, and it is stodgy.'',According to Teen-Age Research Unlimited, there has been a drastic drop in the number of 12-  to 19-year-olds who identify Levi's as a ''cool brand.'' Jill Kilcoyne, associate director of the research firm, based in Northbrook, Ill., said that since the fall of 1997 only 7 percent of teen-agers surveyed named Levi's as ''cool,'' whereas in previous years 15 percent to 16 percent had. Both Tommy Hilfiger and the Gap were more frequently bestowed with that hip designation.,Mr. Haas said closing the plants would essentially allow Levi Strauss to become a ''marketing company'' that would focus mostly on shaping and maintaining its brand image. It would make money from licensing its name.,But Harry Bernard, an analyst with Colton Bernard Inc. in San Francisco, said that just announcing the transformation from manufacturing to marketing was not enough.,''They need a different outlook, a different set of rules,'' he said. ''And I haven't seen it from Levi's yet.''",LESLIE KAUFMAN,"FEB. 23, 1999","Levi Is Closing 11 Factories; 5,900 Jobs Cut",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/business/levi-is-closing-11-factories-5900-jobs-cut.html
"Slowly and quietly, plans are being made for a series of protests over the decision by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to present an honorary Oscar to the 89-year-old director Elia Kazan.,Mr. Kazan was perhaps the most formidable filmmaker of the 1950's and 60's, with such movies as ''On the Waterfront,'' ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''A Face in the Crowd'' and ''East of Eden.'' But he has not been forgiven by some writers, actors and others for appearing before the House Committee on Un-American Activities on April 10, 1952, during the height of the McCarthy era. He informed on eight old friends from the Group Theater who, along with him, had once belonged to the Communist Party.,By planning to award the ailing Mr. Kazan an honorary Oscar at the 71st annual Academy Awards on March 21, the academy opened some old wounds, especially among writers and others who were blacklisted. At the annual Writers Guild Awards dinner in Beverly Hills on Saturday night funds were solicited by a small group of screenwriters who plan to place advertisements in The Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety asking academy members not to applaud Mr. Kazan when he is introduced. The group is made up of mostly elderly, former blacklisted writers, members of their families and supporters, though none of them were named to the House committee by Mr. Kazan.,In the text for those advertisements, scheduled to appear in the next few weeks, the writers say: ''We do not wish to disrupt the awards ceremony, which is important for the industry and for many of our fellow workers. But we do ask for some minimal evidence of disapproval for the academy's insensitive and unconscionable act. Do not stand and applaud Mr. Kazan. Sit on your hands. Let audiences around the world see that there are some in Hollywood, some Americans, who do not support blacklisting, who do not support informers.'',One of the organizers of the advertising effort, Bernard Gordon, a 79-year-old writer who was blacklisted, said the group was also planning a protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center of Los Angeles, where the Oscar ceremony is being held this year.,''This is not an attempt to keep people from going in,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''We want to convey our basic position that it is shameful to honor a man who knuckled under to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, a man who had such prestige and financial invulnerability that there was no need to do this in order to protect his own career.'',Mr. Gordon, like several other veteran screenwriters, said an apology from Mr. Kazan for naming names would defuse much of the opposition to him. But, for the moment, that seems unlikely.,''Apologize? Recant? That's a good Stalinist word,'' said Floria V. Lasky, Mr. Kazan's longtime lawyer. ''It seems to me he never said it was an easy decision.'',Some of Mr. Kazan's strongest opponents have never apologized ''for supporting Stalinism and Communism,'' Ms. Lasky said. ''I expect Mr. Kazan will say 'Thank you' in his speech.'',At the same time, Mr. Kazan's defenders have argued that it was absurd to say that he personally destroyed careers, because he named names that the committee already knew. But Mr. Kazan's critics said that by informing he gave his tacit support to McCarthyism.,In honoring Mr. Kazan, who has had a powerful influence on contemporary filmmakers and actors, the academy was seeking to divorce his extraordinary career from his private life. In recent years groups including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the American Film Institute have ignored efforts to give Mr. Kazan life achievement awards.,Abraham Polonsky, a blacklisted writer, said today: ''The issue for me is, if he apologized, nothing would take place. It would be accepted that people make mistakes. Sterling Hayden apologized. He wrote a book about it.'' But in Mr. Kazan's case, he continued, ''The point is, he's silent. So there'll be protests because of what he said and did.'',Mr. Kazan placed an advertisement in The New York Times after his testimony before the House committee, justifying his action. In the advertisement Mr. Kazan denounced Communism as a ''dangerous and alien conspiracy,'' and said that ''liberals must speak out.'' In his 1988  memoir, ''Elia Kazan: A Life,'' Mr. Kazan said he had acted honorably by informing and would do the same given the chance again.,Mr. Gordon said he was unsure how many demonstrators might gather on the day of the Academy Awards because many people blacklisted during the McCarthy era were too old to appear. Regarding the Academy Awards, he said with a laugh, ''People from all over the world will be watching this silly affair, so we'll get a lot of media coverage.''",BERNARD WEINRAUB,"FEB. 23, 1999",Kazan Honor Stirs Protest By Blacklist Survivors,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/movies/kazan-honor-stirs-protest-by-blacklist-survivors.html
"In the first trial involving a beating at the Nassau County jail since the Federal Government began investigating allegations of widespread brutality there, a mentally retarded man's lawyer told jurors yesterday that his client was savagely beaten in 1993 by a guard wielding a frying pan.,The former inmate, Thomas Donovan Jr., 39, has accused the guard, Salvatore Gemelli, a leader of the correction officers' union, of attacking him as he was arriving at the East Meadow jail. In his civil suit, Mr. Donovan is seeking $100 million from Mr. Gemelli as well as the jail, the county and its hospital.,The trial opened yesterday amid a widening Federal investigation into possible civil rights violations at the Nassau jail, where many current and former inmates have described beatings as an everyday occurrence. The inquiry began after the Jan. 13 death of Thomas Pizzuto, 38, whose family says he was beaten by guards and then left untreated for days. His death, which was ruled a homicide, is being investigated by the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn.,In opening arguments yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Stephen Civardi, Mr. Donovan's lawyer, told jurors that although Mr. Donovan has an I.Q. of 58 and the emotions of a third grader, he gave a detailed account of his beating to prosecutors, who never brought charges in the case.,As he beat Mr. Donovan, the guard taunted him with a bizarre version of  confession, Mr. Civardi said: '' 'I'm God. I'm Jesus Christ. Beg for my forgiveness.' Bam! with a frying pan. 'Get on your knees and beg my forgiveness.' Bam! with a frying pan again.'',Mr. Civardi said that other guards beat Mr. Donovan but that Mr. Gemelli told him to look only at him, ''so you can't identify anybody but me because nobody will believe it.'' Mr. Gemelli, who later was elected president of the union, ''felt he was untouchable,'' Mr. Civardi said.,Mr. Gemelli, who was the booking officer at the jail the night Mr. Donovan arrived there, denies any part in an attack, and has said repeatedly that he remembers nothing of Mr. Donovan. His lawyer, Chris P. Termini, argued yesterday that the beating actually occurred several hours after Mr. Donovan's arrival. He added that no one had corroborated Mr. Donovan's account.,Mr. Termini also said he would play an audiotape secretly recorded by the police, a week after Mr. Donovan's release on bail, in which he said Mr. Donovan told officers that other inmates had caused his injuries by ''playing football with me back and forth.'',Mr. Civardi told jurors that Mr. Donovan lied on the tape because he was afraid that he would be returned to the jail.,Mr. Donovan's family contends that his beating should have come as a red flag to county officials and prosecutors. Instead, the victim's father, Thomas Donovan Sr., a retired banker, has said that investigators and Nassau politicians ''turned their backs'' on his son's case. As a result, he said, referring to Mr. Pizzuto, ''they reaped the death of a young man.'',The trial of Mr. Donovan's lawsuit,  under Federal civil rights statutes, has been split into two phases. In the first, which began yesterday, he will have to prove that Mr. Gemelli attacked him. In the second, he will try to show that the county should be held liable for his injuries. Mr. Gemelli is expected to testify today, as is Mr. Donovan.,Questioning the first witness, Lieut. John Covais of the jail's internal affairs unit, Mr. Civardi repeatedly elicited testimony showing that Mr. Covais had failed to follow up leads, secure physical evidence or interview crucial witnesses until months or even years after the July 23, 1993, attack.,As Thomas Donovan Jr. sat on a courtroom bench, covering his eyes with his hands, his father testified yesterday about his son's first phone call from jail, when he whispered that he had been beaten. ''Tommy was overwhelmingly fearful. He was almost incoherent,'' he said.,When he visited his son in jail three days later, Mr. Donovan said, he asked him to lift his shirt to show his wounds. ''He told me no,'' he testified, saying his son was terrified because guards were in the room. ''He told me they'd kill him.''",DAVID M.

"Volvo A.B. of Sweden, Europe's second-largest truck maker, announced today that it had broken off talks to buy its rival,  Scania A.B., raising speculation that it might set its sights on a United States target in its quest for size and market share.,Last month, Volvo agreed to sell its car division to Ford Motor for $6.5 billion, leaving it potentially cash rich but vulnerable to a takeover if it does not quickly bolster its truck business, analysts said.,Volvo said the negotiations with Scania collapsed over the price sought by Scania's main shareholder, Investor A.B., the financial arm of the Wallenberg family, which controls much of Swedish business. Investor owns 46 percent of Scania's voting stock. Volvo bought a 12.85 percent stake in its rival last month.,Nils Lundin, a spokesman for Investor, said the company was ''interested in finding the best solution for Scania'' and said the possibilities ranged from remaining independent to agreeing to a merger. He did not elaborate.,Shares of Scania slumped 10.5 kronor, or 5 percent, to 203 kronor, while shares of Volvo fell 1.5 kronor, to 215. Volvo's American depository receipts fell 31.25 cents, to $26.50. Investor shares rose 1.5 kronor, to 340.,Swedish analysts said Investor had valued Scania at about 250 kronor a share. Leif Johansson, Volvo's chief executive, said Volvo bought its stake last month.,''Volvo wanted to insure that it could participate in the discussion of Scania's future ownership,'' he said.,Like the auto industry, Europe's heavy-  and medium-truck business faces problems of overcapacity, but analysts said there seemed little likelihood of big savings from a Volvo-Scania deal because of the political obstacles to layoffs at Swedish plants. A merged Volvo-Scania would control 31 percent of Europe's heavy-truck market, but because of the similarities between the two companies, a deal would ''have been a case of one plus one making one and a half,'' one analyst said.,Speculation on a possible takeover target has, in part, centered on the Navistar International Corporation, based in Chicago. Volvo's heavy-duty trucks accounted for 11.5 percent of the surging United States truck market in 1998 and a deal with Navistar would double that to create the second-biggest truck builder after DaimlerChrysler A.G.'s Freightliner.

"The Clinton Administration announced an agreement with Russia today to strictly control its surging exports of steel to the United States, an attempt to balance the bitter complaints of American steelmakers with efforts to keep from worsening Russia's economic slide.,Under the accord, Russia has agreed to roll back its sales of steel to the United States to the amount it shipped in 1996 and the first half of 1997, before a sharp fall in the value of the country's currency led to a surge of shipments here. Steel production accounts for 7 percent of Russia's gross national product, and is a huge source of scarce hard currency.,Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley, at a news conference today, said, ''We are trying to respond to the steel industry's concerns without bringing Russia to its knees.'',Nonetheless, the agreement left American steel producers and workers dissatisfied, and some in Congress are threatening to press legislation that would virtually cut off steel imports. Ten days ago, seeking to act ahead of Congress, the Commerce Department ruled that steel from Japan and Brazil had been dumped in the American market -- sold at prices well below the cost of production -- and announced that it would impose huge tariffs against imports of hot-rolled steel from both countries.,The department also concluded that Russian producers had dumped their steel, but penalties were not announced because negotiations over the agreement announced today were already under way.,Assessing Russia's share of the American steel market is not easy. By the end of last year, foreign manufacturers accounted for about 30 percent of all steel sold in the United States, up from about 20 percent the previous year. Russia accounted for about a third of all the hot-rolled steel that surged into the American market last year, but the Commerce Department says there are no reliable estimates of how much of the market it commanded for other products.,A comprehensive five-year accord of the kind struck with Russia would be illegal with Japan and Brazil, both of which  are members of the World Trade Organization. The W.T.O.'s rules bar managed-trade agreements of the kind reached with Russia. But because Russia has yet to qualify for entry into the organization, Washington was free to go ahead with an accord, Mr. Daley said, conceding that ''the agreement would be null and void'' if Russia entered the trade grouping.,In this negotiation, Washington held most of the cards. Russia's alternative was the imposition of the kind of tariffs applied to Japan and Brazil -- so steep that they would essentially stop all shipments. Instead, Russian shipments will be reduced by about 70 percent.,Hot-rolled steel from Russia will come down to levels that existed before 1996. Sixteen other types of steel will be limited to 1997 levels.,''These agreements,'' Mr. Daley said today, ''deliver on the Administration's commitment to respond vigorously to the surge in imports that has threatened the livelihoods of communities and workers around the nation.'' But they also respond to the concerns of Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin, who has been involved in the International Monetary Fund's negotiations over resuming aid to Russia, and of the National Security Council, which fears that a further economic breakdown in Moscow could further destabilize the Government of the ailing President Boris N. Yeltsin.,''There is a legitimate concern about taking Russia to its knees,'' Mr. Daley said today.,Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, complained that the agreement negotiated by the Commerce Department would still permit the importing of too much low-priced steel. And the Bethlehem Steel Corporation said that the industry might seek Federal court relief if the Administration carried out the Russian accord.,But the bigger threat to the Administration's plans is a bill now circulating in the House that would limit the amount of foreign steel permitted into the United States.,Today's deal is the kind of agreement that in other contexts the Administration has denounced as interference with market forces. For example, it sets an annual quota for hot-rolled steel -- 750,000 metric tons, or slightly more than 20 percent of the amount imported last year -- and fixes minimum prices for the steel. It also imposes a six-month moratorium on all imports of hot-rolled steel, to work down a glut on the market.,In return, the Commerce Department said it would not impose penalty tariffs on hot-rolled steel. Those could have ranged as high as 218 percent.",DAVID E.

Mathematics tops his list.,''Simple mathematical skills are just going right out the window,'' he said. Having a tax program do our addition only encourages this. Our returns may be more accurate, but we're getting lazier. And if we can no longer do the math ourselves, he asked, ''how are we going to understand if we're getting ripped off?'',And accuracy works both ways. A teen-ager in Dunkirk, N.Y., was once expecting a refund of $23. Instead, he received $555,555. If you E-filers want to pass up your chance at $555,555, that's fine by me; it just improves the odds for the rest of us.,Advantage: Paper.,SECURITY -- People in the E-tax business are extremely concerned about keeping criminals and precocious 11-year-olds from hacking into your tax return. Thus, E-filers may be asked to use secret numbers, passwords, decoder rings or backward writing that has to be read with a mirror.,But this ignores a broader danger, which I call the Kite in a Box Effect. Try this test: In a large box, place one 20-foot-long rope, one extension cord and one kite with string. Store the box in your garage for five years. Open. Rope, cord and kite string will be hopelessly tangled together, even though no one has touched the box.,Electronic communications are like that box. We've got telephones,  pagers and a few zillion other things all sending out electronic signals. Sooner or later, tangling will occur. Do I want my ''income or (loss) from tax-shelter farm activities'' marching across someone's beeper?,Advantage: Paper.,SPEED -- All right, for crying out loud, you get your refund in days, not weeks, if you E-file. Big deal.,Advantage: E-filing.,PHYSICAL SAFETY -- In 25 years of doing my taxes by hand, I have never been seriously injured. By contrast, the Web site of the Consumer Product Safety Commission contains recent recall notices for seven computer products and 11 surge protectors. These notices use phrases like ''fire, shock and electrocution hazards.'' Given the already natural pairing of ''death and taxes,'' it seems like an accident waiting to happen.,Advantage: Paper.,PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS -- Clearly, we humans are in danger of being downsized right out of the tax equation. We can already file electronically. The I.R.S. already offers to deposit your refund directly into your bank account. Turbotax and the others can already jump-start your return for next year, by grafting information onto it from this year's. It's not much of a leap to having your employer, bank and other institutions send their forms directly into the I.R.S. computer, which would fill out your return automatically and make the appropriate deposit or withdrawal from your bank account. The tax system would become a perpetual-motion machine; the taxpayer would be expendable.,Mr. Tullos of Securetax is not worried. ''That is potentially where it can go,'' he said, ''but where I differ from a lot of people is the pace at which I think it's going to go there.'',For one thing, he said, public resistance would be too great -- people would balk at giving up all control.,Professor Crabb would resist. Tax time, he says, is a chance for personal stock-taking. ''When you do your taxes, if you do them by hand, you get a mental model of what your income is and where it goes,'' he said. So the less automated, the better.,More cosmically, he's worried that we too readily turn our lives over to experts and technologies. ''It's just this chain of trust that we enter into, and we're helpless,'' he said.,Advantage: Paper.,COUNTERINTUITIVE CONCLUSION -- Despite the clear superiority of paper, I'm trying E-filing this year. Why? Because the I.R.S. says it will contribute to the public good, and we Luddites are nothing if not patriotic.,My biggest fear, though, is that when I get to the last E-page, where you tell the computer to send the documents on their way, that final on-screen box will say, ''Submit.'',My likely response: ''Never!''",NEIL GENZLINGER,"FEB. 28, 1999","YOUR TAXES; One Luddite Down, but Swinging All the Way",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-one-luddite-down-but-swinging-all-the-way.html
"Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery,526 West 26th Street,Chelsea,Through March 27,Esso Gallery,191 Chrystie Street, near Rivington Street,Lower East Side,Through April 17,The painter Donna Moylan has a lot on her mind, maybe too much. Her exhibitions at Klagsbrun and Esso, which together form her third solo show in New York, teem with pictorial ideas, multicultural awareness and representational modes: aboriginal dream-time patterns as well as charts, maps, graphs and even physics equations. The works range from semi-abstract paintings involving layered images and patterns, to abstract works painted on African fabric, to more traditional landscape studies and figure sketches.,Not all of this is equally successful, and as the preceding list might suggest, it can sometimes veer too close to artists like Sigmar Polke, David Salle and William Wegman, while also bringing to mind the rotating styles of Dona Nelson. Like Ms. Nelson, Ms. Moylan does not want to settle into a rut or simply turn out a well-made product, an admirable attitude. But so far, she lacks Ms. Nelson's emotional focus and technical inventiveness, with the result that her work can seem scattered and cerebral.,Still, many of the paintings at Klagsbrun hold the eye on the strength of radiant color, thinly applied paint, contrasting techniques, unlikely combinations of images and references, and, perhaps most important, exhilarating manipulations of space. Examples include ''Ben's House,'' with its velvety blacks and hallucinatory stars, and a vast untitled landscape whose brilliant sky contains Abstract Expressionist swirls and non-Western religious symbols.,There are moments of nails-on-blackboard discordance, as in the grisaille landscape and blocky checkerboard of ''Brush Strokes.'' And sometimes the added images merely detract from striking backgrounds, like the meandering concentric lines of ''To Read'' or the high-keyed strata of ''Frame Dragging,'' which one seems to observe from the distance of a helicopter.,The show at Esso seems to contain more outtakes than finished works, but it creates a vivid impression of Ms. Moylan's restlessness and range of interests. Deftly drawn images of people from different cultures and economic backgrounds are frequent, often on canvases papered with pages full of physics equations or typewritten drafts of a lecture about art.,But the best works at Esso are a group of small solidly painted landscapes. While not as original as the big paintings at Klagsbrun, they hold their own and expose the solid foundation of Ms. Moylan's provocative accumulation of hits and misses.

"A NUMBER of tax breaks come into play with the 1998 returns that Americans are now preparing, including child and education credits and new Roth I.R.A.'s. But they come at a price: new paperwork.,Still, when a tax return is approached step by step, most of the work is not too difficult. There are essentially two sets of numbers: income and deductions. Overlook any income -- say, reinvested mutual fund dividends -- and the Internal Revenue Service will demand its due. Neglect to take any deductions to which you are entitled, and you won't hear a peep; you'll just pay too much.,To help taxpayers understand the tax process, Jan M. Rosen of The New York Times used Macintax to prepare this return for a hypothetical two-income family, the Taxpayers, and wrote the accompanying commentary. The package was double-checked by tax professionals at Intuit Inc., which publishes the program and its sister program for Windows, Turbotax.,The most daunting aspect of this return is Form 8606, which was needed because an individual retirement account was converted to a new Roth I.R.A. Edward A. Slott, a certified public accountant in Rockville Centre, N.Y., and publisher of Ed Slott's I.R.A. Advisor, a newsletter, offered advice on that portion of the return.,Filling Out the 1040,The heart of a tax return, Form 1040 shows all income, adjustments to income and deductions, mostly as bottom-line figures brought forward from attached schedules and forms. Once all those forms have been completed, taxable income and tax liability, along with any refund or payment due, are calculated on the back of the 1040. Using a computer program, like Macintax, with extensive on-screen reference materials, or an on-line program is much easier than filling out forms by hand. Users answer questions in an on-screen inter-view, and the program puts the answers in all the right places on the forms and makes the calculations.,Like most married couples, the Taxpayers -- Samuel and Felicity -- are filing jointly (Line 2). They are en-titled to five exemptions (Line 6) -- two for themselves and one each for their daughter, Heidi; their son, Cyril, and Samuel's father, Sydney, whom they support.,Their income comes from several sources. Felicity and Samuel both had wages, she as a teacher and he as an insurance executive. The numbers from their W-2 forms are totaled on Line 7. Interest income (Line 8) and dividend income (Line 9) come from Schedule B. The Taxpayers received no state tax refund last year, but people who did must generally report on Line 10 any amount of the refund that was included in itemized deductions on their 1997 returns. Felicity quit her teaching job after the spring term and opened a music studio in the fall, giving individual and group lessons. Because of her first-year expenses, she had a loss (Line 12) that is calculated on Schedule C. Capital gains (Line 13) come from Schedule D.,When Samuel changed jobs a few years ago, he had his pension money rolled over into an I.R.A.; he has also made nondeductible I.R.A. contributions. The Tax-payers converted $50,000 of their I.R.A. money into a Roth I.R.A. but decided that was too much and put $10,000 of it back into a regular I.R.A. That is why their total I.R.A. distributions are $60,000 (Line 15a).,The Taxpayers took advantage of an opportunity available only in 1998 -- to spread the tax burden of their I.R.A. conversion over four years; thus $9,600 is taxable (Line 15b). They could make the Roth conver-sion because their adjusted gross income without it would have been below $100,000, the limit for eligibility.,Total income (Line 22) is $121,903, but Samuel had to pay alimony of $15,000 (Line 31a) to his first wife, and that brings the couple's adjusted gross income down to $106,903. The ex-wife's Social Security number must be shown (Line 31a). Alimony is taxable to recipients.,After deductions of $18,799 (Line 36 and Schedule A) and five personal exemptions worth $13,500 (Line 38), the Taxpayers have taxable income of $74,604 (Line 39).,Their tax of $15,309 (Line 40) is cut to $14,326 (Line 49) by a $560 credit for child and dependent care (Line 41 and Form 2441), a $400 child credit (Line 43), which is calculated on a new work sheet (not shown) and a $23 credit (Line 46) for foreign taxes. They own some Brit-ish stocks, and Britain withholds taxes on dividends. Because the amount is small, the Taxpayers do not have to file Form 1116. A household employment tax of $306 (Line 55 and Schedule H) for Heidi's sitter brings their total tax to $14,632 (Line 55). Because $13,700 was with-held from their pay (Line 57), the Taxpayers owe $932 (Line 68). That's good planning. People who get a refund have given Uncle Sam an interest-free loan.,Schedule A: Itemized Deductions,Like most other people, the Taxpayers cannot deduct medical expenses (Line 4), which are deductible only to the extent that unreimbursed outlays exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income ($8,018 for them, on Line 3).,They can deduct state and local income taxes of $3,569 (Line 5), real estate taxes of $4,800 (Line 6), home mort-gage interest of $8,200 (Line 10) and gifts to charity of $2,230 (Line 18). If audited, filers must be able to show a receipt from a charity for any single gift of $250 or more. The $430 (Line 16) is for old clothing and toys donated to a church rummage sale, and it is based on prices at the sale, not on the original cost.,Mortgage interest on a first and second home is generally deductible, as is interest on home equity loans of up to $100,000. Points may be de-ducted up front when buying or improving a house but in a refinancing must be amor-tized over the life of the loan.,The Taxpayers could not take a miscellaneous itemized deduction (Line 26), which is allowed only to the extent that outlays for such things as union or professional dues and unreimbursed business expenses exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income ($2,138 on Line 25).,Their itemized deductions total $18,799 (Line 28). Total deductions may be pared for joint filers whose adjusted gross incomes exceed $124,500.,Schedule B: Interest and Dividends,Banks, brokers, mutual funds and other payers of in-terest and dividends, includ-ing reinvested dividends, must send a Form 1099 to both recipients and the I.R.S., which can then identify people who do not report the income.,In the interest section, (Line 1) $650 is from municipal bonds. It is listed and then subtracted out as tax-exempt, leaving taxable interest of $1,550 (Line 4). Dividends total $2,090 (Line 6). It is no longer necessary to list mutual fund capital gains distributions or nontaxable distributions on this form. Capital gains distributions are now listed on Schedule D; there is no place to show the nontaxable distributions. The questions on foreign accounts (Lines 7 and 8) must be answered.,Schedule C: Profit or Loss From Business,Most self-employed people like Felicity Taxpayer, who started a business in 1998 (box checked on Line H), must file Schedule C, as must company directors or people with sideline work who earned income on which no taxes were withheld. Other forms are used for incorporated businesses and partnerships.,Business income (the I.R.S. means revenue) of $21,100 (Line 7) was more than offset by expenses of $27,700 (Line 28), resulting in a net loss of $6,600 (Line 31). Felicity's expenses included $15,000 for musical instruments (Line 13). Up to $18,500 of equip-ment and other items may be deducted at once, instead of depreciating the purchases over several years.,Felicity paid rent of $6,000 (Line 20b) for a studio in a shopping center, avoiding the home-office deduction that the I.R.S. tends to scrutinize.,Because her business is not yet profitable, she does not have to pay self-employment tax (Schedule SE) and cannot contribute to a Keogh plan -- and thus has no deductions for self-employment tax or Keogh contributions on Form 1040.,Form 8606: Nondeductible I.R.A.'s,The Taxpayers, who con-verted some of their I.R.A. money into a new Roth I.R.A. (Line 14a), must file this form. They also switched -- or recharacterized -- $10,000 of it (Line 14b) back into a regular I.R.A.,Mr. Slott, the Long Island accountant, warned that anyone who tries to fill the form in by hand may make a mistake because Line 8 says, Add lines 6 and 7. But buried on page 5 of an eight-page manual for the form is the further instruction to in-clude Line 14c in the calcu-lations. People using Mac-intax or Turbotax have it easier: They simply copy the numbers from the Forms 1099-R they receive into the program's work sheets; the program fills in the forms.,Taxes must be paid on any money converted to a Roth I.R.A. from deductible I.R.A.'s. When people also have nondeductible I.R.A.'s, the law treats the conversion as coming proportionally from both; in this case $38,400 (Line 16) of their final $40,000 conversion (Line 14c) is taxable. One-fourth of it, or $9,600 (Line 17), is taxable this year.,Form 2441: Child and Dependent Care Expenses,Working people like the Taxpayers -- or those looking for work -- whose adjusted gross income exceeds $28,000 can claim a credit of up to $480 for one dependent and up to $960 for two or more. (Credits reduce taxes dollar for dollar.) The Social Security or employer identification numbers of care providers must be shown.,Employer-sponsored dependent care assistance programs can be even more valuable. Samuel shielded $2,000 of his income from taxes through such a program for Heidi's care. (That benefit is reported on page 2, not shown.) In the Taxpayers' 28 percent bracket, that is equal to taxable income of $2,778. But they put aside only enough for Heidi's sitter, then unexpectedly had to spend $7,500 for Samuel's father, Sydney, who had Alzheimer's.,But no more than $4,800 for two or more dependents can be used in figuring the credit. For the Taxpayers that was limited to $2,800 (Line 6) because of the dependent care account, so they can claim a credit of $560 (Line 9).,Schedule H: Household Employment Taxes,People who employ household help like baby sit-ters, maids or gardeners must file Schedule H to pay what has become known as the nanny tax. They must also have a Federal employer identification number, entered at the upper right of Schedule H.,The Taxpayers employed Daphne Purr to care for Heidi after school. She earned $2,000, so they had to pay Social Security tax of $248 (Line 2) and Medicare tax of $58 (Line 4). Because her wages did not exceed $1,000 in any one quarter, they were not liable for Federal unem-ployment tax. The total tax of $306 (Line 8) is brought for-ward to Line 55 of Form 1040. Many people pay cash to household help and do not report it, but that is illegal.,The $2,000 paid to Ms. Purr came from the pretax money in Samuel's dependent care assistance account. A similar pretax account is available through many employers for medical expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance. Employees choose how much of their salaries to put aside in the accounts.,Schedule D: Capital Gains And Losses,After the confusion caused by the three capital gains holding periods created by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Congress reversed itself in 1998 and brought the number back down to two. Short term is a year or less, and gains are taxed at ordinary income rates. Long term is more than a year, and gains on securities are taxable at a maximum rate of 20 percent.,The Taxpayers sold four stocks and had a capital gains distribution from a mutual fund (Line 13). Two sales resulted in a net short-term capital gain of $3,338 (Line 7). The other two sales and the mutual fund distribution, which by law is considered long term, resulted in a net long-term gain of $925 (Line 16). Altogether, they had a net gain of $4,263 (Line 17).,On Part IV of Schedule D their income tax liability of $15,309 before credits (Line 54) is calculated. For those who have a net loss, up to $3,000 can be taken against ordinary income, and any excess can be carried forward to future years.,Looking Ahead,A tax return is a road map of a family's personal finances. So before filing away the finished copies for 1998, it is a good idea to study them to see what financial changes may be in order for the current year.,For example, assuming that Felicity's business becomes profitable, she may want to open a Keogh tax-deferred retirement plan. The couple may also want to consider putting an additional $2,000 apiece into Roth I.R.A.'s this year, if their income is below the $160,000 phase-out limit. Retirement distributions from a Roth will generally be tax-free.,With two children, the Tax-payers may also consider setting up new Education I.R.A.'s, although some financial advisers consider them to be much ado about very little -- a maximum of $500 a child can be contrib-uted annually.,Another way to save for education while saving on state taxes is through the qualified state tuition programs that many states are adopting, but parents and grandparents will want to evaluate such a move from an investment, as well as a tax, standpoint.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR TAXES; Mastering The Form 1040: A Step-by-Step Guide,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-mastering-the-form-1040-a-step-by-step-guide.html
"FOR the better part of two decades, the Federal budget deficit imposed tight limits on debates over tax policy. Republicans could not indulge their political and ideological desire to return more money to the people. Democrats were forced to support tax increases to maintain spending for the social programs they championed.,Now, with the advent of large and growing budget surpluses, the terms of the debate are being rewritten. No longer shackled by the demands of austerity, Republicans are pressing for a big tax cut this year, although they remain divided over the form and the size. The Clinton Administration is trying to thwart the Republican plan by demanding that Social Security and Medicare get first dibs on the surplus.,While the political fight this year and probably into the 2000 elections will center on that shorthand -- tax cuts versus saving Social Security -- there is also a growing focus on another, older and more fundamental issue. Should tax policy focus simply on raising the revenue needed to pay for the activities of Government? Or can the tax code be used as an effective instrument to address the nation's social and economic ills?,President Clinton is emerging as a determined advocate of the engineering approach, proposing to use tax law in myriad narrowly focused ways to help specific groups and encourage particular goals.,Because the rules that govern the Federal budget process make it all but impossible to create new spending programs, politicians are becoming increasingly creative in using tax credits and other breaks to direct money toward what they see as compelling problems. In the budget he sent to Congress this month, Mr. Clinton could not propose spending $5 billion to help families with the costs of long-term health care or $3.7 billion to help communities replace or modernize crumbling schools. But under the budget rules, he was able to allocate those amounts to those needs through tax credits. And these are just a few of dozens of examples.,''For the last few years, the dominant view has been one that regards the income tax system as if it were chicken soup -- a magic elixir to address any of the nation's social and economic problems,'' said Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School and a former Treasury Department official. ''Mr. Clinton's budget is only the most recent example. It seems to be becoming more and more extreme all the time.'',Republicans object to most of Mr. Clinton's proposals. And many of them advocate either streamlining the income tax system or replacing it with a new approach, perhaps a tax on consumption. They would wipe out the numerous so-called targeted provisions that critics say make the current tax code horrifically complex and inefficient. But for all their talk of driving a stake through the heart of the Internal Revenue Service, most Republicans in the end go along with the practice of loading up the tax code with provisions intended not just to raise money but also to reward specific companies, industries, groups or people.,''The pendulum seems to have swung about as far as it's ever gone in terms of these little tweaks and twists and doodads intended to reach targeted objectives,'' said Gregory F. Jenner, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Washington.,The Clinton Administration and most Congressional Democrats object to across-the-board reductions in income tax rates, contending that they benefit the wealthy disproportionately. They say that targeted tax breaks insure that help goes to those who need it most, and that they can enact a modest package of such cuts this year without having to spend any of the surplus.,Two examples of the approach they favor are the earned income tax credit for the working poor, which was expanded in 1993, and the tax credit for lower-  and middle-income families with children that was instituted in 1997. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said that these moves have given a family of four with half the median income the lowest income and payroll tax burden in 31 years.,But critics say the targeted approach has long since gotten out of hand.,The more the tax code deals with additional social and economic issues, the further it moves from the notion that people with equal incomes should pay equal taxes. Moreover, each new tax break creates more complexity; the child credit that many people will be able to claim for the first time during this filing season required a new work sheet and, for families with three or more children, a new form, and has proved to be a headache for many taxpayers, despite the ultimate reward of up to $400 a child on 1998 tax returns.,''They are exponentially increasing complexity, particularly for the middle class, which up until recently had not been the beneficiaries of these targeted initiatives,'' Mr. Jenner said.,IN pushing for an across-the-board income tax rate reduction of 10 percent or more, Republican leaders say they want to provide relief for all taxpayers, not just a chosen few, and to do so in the simplest possible way.,''Taxpayers won't be denied a tax cut simply because they don't behave the way the Government thinks they should or don't fall into a certain Government-prescribed category,'' said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and a Presidential hopeful.,Mr. Kasich, who derided the White House's targeted approach as being for ''left-handed cab drivers in New York,'' said reducing each of the five income tax rates by 10 percent would mean that ''taxpayers will not have to fill out new forms or decipher complicated instructions to get their tax cut.'',But not all Republicans agree, and Mr. Kasich signaled last week that he might have to scale back his plan to win support for it within the party.,Senate Republicans want to phase in any tax cut more slowly than Mr. Kasich has proposed. Moderate Republicans in the House prefer a package of cuts aimed at the middle class because they do not want to be accused by the Democrats of giving most of the benefits to the wealthy.,The moderates are rallying around an alternative plan that would provide narrowly drawn tax reductions -- largely for the middle class -- including scaling back the so-called marriage penalty, which leaves many couples in which both spouses work and have fairly similar incomes with a higher tax bill than that of two single people with the same incomes.,The moderates also want further increases in the amount of money retirees can earn before Social Security benefits become taxable. And they favor steps to restrict the impact of the alternative minimum tax on people who claim the new child and education credits.,Mr. Clinton's plan includes a variety of poll-tested tax proposals to deal with health care, child care, education, the environment and other issues.,They include a proposed $1,000 credit to help offset the costs of long-term health care, tax credits for employers who set up literacy and basic education programs in the workplace, an elimination of the 60-month limit on the deductibility of student loan interest, an increase in the credit for child care expenses and an expansion of a tax credit for the purchase of fuel-efficient and low-emission vehicles.,The White House strategy over the last few years has been to propose as many initiatives as it can stuff into its budget and then negotiate hard to force the Republican Congress to include a few of them in the final tax and spending laws passed at the end of the session.,The surplus could provide enough wiggle room to accommodate both parties, up to a point. But it remains unclear, in the aftermath of impeachment and with the 2000 election looming, whether either side wants a deal. The early signs are that this year could be one in which both sides make their arguments for what fiscal policy should look like at the dawn of the 21st century, and then let the voters decide.",RICHARD W. STEVENSON,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR TAXES; How Far To Swing The Ax?,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-how-far-to-swing-the-ax.html
"ON Sept. 15, 1990, her 35th birthday, Frankie Garrett got the type of present that most people would not wish on their worst enemies.,Representatives of the Internal Revenue Service knocked on the front door of her home in Tallahassee, Fla., she said, telling her that she and her husband, Claude Cash, owed money. At first, Ms. Garrett thought someone was playing a birthday prank on her.,That morning, she stopped off to see her husband at the construction site where he was working. She said he told her not to worry -- that he would take care of things. But her nightmare had just begun.,A month later, Ms. Garrett said, she was told by I.R.S. agents in Tallahassee that she and her husband owed the Federal Government about $20,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties and interest because her husband, who was self-employed, failed to file quarterly tax returns between 1986 and 1989. Ms. Garrett, a switchboard operator for the Florida Department of Education, recalls being ''livid.'' She had not known that the quarterly returns were mandatory in their situation, she said.,She said she gave Mr. Cash six months to straighten things out with the I.R.S. and, after he did not, decided to leave him. The divorce came through about a year after the I.R.S. first came calling, but the agency has since continued to collect money from her -- toward the balance owed from the years of her marriage, as well as for interest penalties that continue to accrue.,Mr. Cash, who still lives in Tallahassee, did not return several calls seeking comment on his own dealings with the I.R.S. A spokeswoman for the agency said that confidentiality laws prevented it from commenting on his situation or any other individual case.,Ms. Garrett is one of thousands of people -- nearly all of them women -- who may find themselves dealing with payment demands from the I.R.S. even though they believe they were not responsible for any underpayment. When a couple have filed a joint return, as most married couples do, the agency can go to either husband or wife for the money.,In I.R.S. parlance, people like Ms. Garrett may fall under the category of ''innocent spouses.'' But until recently, proving that an individual was truly innocent -- that he or she had no knowledge of the violations of the tax laws and did not benefit from the money kept from the Government -- was virtually impossible, said Jay Freireich, a tax lawyer in Florham Park, N.J., who specializes in innocent-spouse issues.,A new law that took effect in July, however, makes innocent-spouse status easier to claim. It gives the I.R.S. the burden of proving that a claimant was aware of tax problems and broadens the definition of an innocent spouse.,Since April, when the I.R.S. began centralized tracking of these cases,  about 10,000 people have filed for innocent-spouse status, said Maria Hwang, a program manager for the assistant I.R.S. commissioner of examination.,''The stories these women tell are hair-raising,'' said Beth Cockrell, a stockbroker in New York, who by publicizing her own situation brought attention to the plight of innocent spouses and worked to get the 66-year-old law changed. Now, through a group she formed called Women for Income Financial Equity, Ms. Cockrell keeps track of people like Ms. Garrett, steering them toward lawyers and accountants who are familiar with the issue.,MS. GARRETT said that like many women who let their husbands handle the finances, she never paid close attention to the couple's tax returns, although she signed them.,She said that she has managed to whittle the unpaid balance down to $9,000, but that all of her annual tax refunds have gone toward the bill. She said the I.R.S. also auctioned off several acres of land on which she had planned to build a house for herself and her two daughters. She now lives in a small house owned by a member of her family. Several years ago, she said, the I.R.S. also tried to dock her pay, but gave up after realizing that her salary barely covered her expenses.,Frustration led Ms. Garrett to appeal to Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. He was already interested in the innocent-spouse issue and, along with former Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, sponsored the legislation that President Clinton signed July 22. Last April 15, Ms. Garrett appeared with Mr. Graham in Tallahassee to talk about a need for changes in the innocent-spouse law, a spokesman for the Senator said. Now that the new law is in place, Ms. Garrett plans to seek innocent-spouse status.,''The rules have softened now, so I think she has a much better shot,'' said Shawne Blair, Ms. Garrett's sister, a certified public accountant in Boca Raton, Fla. In the past, Ms. Blair dissuaded her sister from seeking innocent-spouse status, thinking she would not qualify.,Even under the new law, Ms. Garrett would be unlikely to recover the bulk of the money she has had to pay, though she probably would not be held responsible for the remaining balance and could get refunds of her payments in the last two years.,Since 1990, Ms. Garrett has dealt with I.R.S. officials in Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Atlanta. She has kept a notebook -- three inches thick now -- that documents the contacts.,''I've been fighting this battle for nearly nine years and it's been a total headache,'' she said. ''But I'm not a quitter, and I feel as if I've been mistreated and stomped on. Thankfully, it looks like I'm getting to the end of the road.''",MICHELLE LEDER,"FEB. 28, 1999","YOUR TAXES; For Better, for Worse at the I.R.S.",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/your-taxes-for-better-for-worse-at-the-irs.html
"MOST home-and-garden shows have a fairly predictable assortment of vendors hawking a fairly standard assortment of windows, doors, wall-coverings, bath fixtures and kitchen appliances. But they also provide a showcase for newer products that are not yet widely familiar. .,Among the products at last weekend's 20th Annual Builders' Home Show in Kingston, Pa., near Wilkes-Barre, were an innovative gutter design, a siding system designed to be to houses what custom-made clothing is to people and a framing -- or rather molding -- system for poured-concrete structures.,''The Gutter That Never Clogs . . . Guaranteed!'' was a tag line guaranteed to catch the eye of any homeowner who has spent the better part of an afternoon perched on a ladder scraping soggy leaves out of a clogged rain gutter. ''If a Leafguard gutter clogs, we'll clean it for you,'' said Jim Palushock, office manager for F & L Gutter Systems in Hazelton, Pa.,Mr. Palushock's company is a distributor of the Leafguard gutter system, a replacement gutter manufactured by Englert Leafguard in Perth Amboy, N.J. The Leafguard gutter, he explained, never has to be cleaned because it is designed to prevent the buildup of debris.,Steve Bradley, operations manager for Englert Leafguard, explained that with an ordinary gutter, the top is either left wide open -- thus acting as a catch basin for leaves -- or it is covered with an add-on screen that must be cleaned periodically so that accumulated debris does not block water from flowing into the gutter.,But the Leafguard gutter has a built-in sloping hood that extends beyond the roof's edge and over the gutter channel, keeping solid objects out of the gutter. And rather than just end at the far edge of the gutter the hood instead curls down and in -- like a breaking wave -- so that the lip of the hood ends up positioned over the gutter channel.,When water and debris coming down the roof get to the hood, Mr. Bradley explained, the debris falls off at the curve while the water -- obeying the principle of molecuar adhesion -- sticks to the hood surface just long enough for it to reverse course and get in over the gutter where gravity then gets the upper hand and causes the water to drip down into the gutter.,(This is similar to what happens when you try to slowly pour liquid out of a container that is filled to the brim. It's virtually impossible to prevent at least some of the liquid from running down the side of the container and dripping off the bottom.),The Leafguard system, Mr. Bradley explained, is a not an ''add-on'' for an existing gutter, but a replacement cut and formed ''on-site'' to the exact size necessary.,And while it is more expensive than an ordinary gutter, costing from $8 to $13 a foot to install, depending on location and complexity of the installation, he said, all LeafGuard systems come with a lifetime warranty against clogs. (Additional information can be obtained by calling (800) 638-2507.),Another ''made-on-location'' exhibit at the Kingston show was sponsored by ABC Seamless of the Poconos, a roofing and siding company in Pocono Summit, Pa. ''We bring the factory to your house,'' said William T. Winkler, president of the company, which is a franchisee of ABC Seamless, a siding manufacturer in Fargo, N.D.,Mr. Winkler pointed out that while much of the siding material installed today is made of vinyl or aluminum, the siding he installs is made of hot-dipped galvanized steel coated with polyvinyl chloride -- commonly known as PVC -- to provide protection against the elements while allowing for expansion and contraction without cracking. Moreover, ABC Seamless siding is ''custom-tailored'' to fit each house.,Standard aluminum and vinyl siding material, Mr. Winkler explained, comes in lengths of about 12 1/2 feet. Whenever the area to be covered is larger than that, he said, separate pieces of siding must be used. And that results in visible seams where the individual sections overlap.,Seamless siding, on the other hand, comes on a roll, and can be measured, formed and cut to the exact size needed by installers working from a specially equipped truck  parked outside the client's house.  And since the siding material can be cut to any length of up to 150 feet long, overlaps are unnecessary and unsightly seams are eliminated.,''Our cost is generally 15 to 20 percent higher than the cost of vinyl,'' Mr. Winkler said, adding that ABC Seamless carries a lifetime warranty on the material itself and a 20-year warranty against defects in installation. Additional information may be obtained by calling (800) 732-6577.,Another intriguing product on exhibit at the show was ECO-Block -- a product that provides a new way of building houses from concrete.,''ECO-Block provides a labor-saving, energy-efficient method of building with concrete,'' said Bill Cotton, the owner of Cotton's Concrete Foundations and Forms, a construction company based Athens, Pa.,With the ECO-Block system, Mr. Cotton said, a house starts out as a hollow-walled shell made of expanded polystyrene foam. The shell is constructed with 2 1/2-inch-thick rectangular panels -- each about 4 feet wide and 16 inches high -- fastened into topless, bottomless, open-ended ''blocks'' by using special connectors that create a 4-  to 12-inch-wide space between the facing panels.,The blocks are then assembled to form the hollow-walled shell and, after openings for windows and doors have been cut out of the walls and fitted with frames, the shell becomes a mold, or form, for the exterior walls of the finished structure.,''You just pour in the concrete,'' Mr. Cotton said. ''It's actually easier than building with wood.'',James Dorr, northeast region manager for ECO-Block, the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company that manufactures the product (its Web site is www.eco-block.com), said that using polystyrene foam as the form for the concrete had several advantages.,First, he said, unlike plywood -- the form material most commonly used in concrete construction -- Eco-Block does not have to be removed after the concrete has cured. Instead, Mr. Dorr said, the 2 1/2-inch-thick foam serves as insulation on both the inner and outer surface of the exterior walls, thereby cutting heating and cooling costs and eliminating the need for additional insulation in the exterior walls.,And, he said, since Eco-Blocks have built-in nailing strips every eight inches, it is possible to fasten virtually any standard finish material to the interior and exterior walls -- including sheetrock, paneling, siding, brickface or stucco. Moreover, he said, electrical conduits and plumbing can be routed through the interior face of the exterior walls -- without having to drill holes through scores of framing studs -- simply by using a router or ''hot knife'' to carve a channel in the polystyrene. And perimeter support for interior floors, he said, is easily created by imbedding galvanized ''joist hangers'' in the concrete walls.,Construction costs vary from area to area, Mr. Dorr said, but the cost of building a concrete house using the Eco-Block system typically runs only 1 to 2 percent more than conventional construction methods.,''And when you're surrounded by six inches of concrete and five inches of foam,'' he said, ''you just wouldn't believe how quiet a house can be.''",JAY ROMANO,"FEB. 28, 1999",YOUR HOME; Products That Make Life Easier,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/your-home-products-that-make-life-easier.html
"SEAN NUTLEY, a Manhattanite who organizes parties for Wipe magazine and for Cesar Galindo, a designer, thought he had found his personal Shangri-La in the Hudson River Valley. Every weekend for the last two years, Mr. Nutley has shed the leather pants and orange Jean Paul Gaultier shirts he favors in the city and has put on Levi's and a sweater to tend his garden at a second home in Stone Ridge, N.Y.,Then one Saturday night, he was having dinner at the Bear Cafe, a streamside restaurant with a big fireplace -- very Woodstock, the town just up the road. In walked Donovan Leitch, the lower Manhattan scene-maker, along with Kirsty Hume, Amber Valletta and other supermodels, all puffing fiercely on cigarettes. They stuck out like a Fendi clutch bag at the farmers' market.,''It's social pollution!'' Mr. Nutley exclaimed, recalling the night last fall that he first realized his upstate hideaway might be changing, and not for the better in his view. ''I deal with models and stylists every day, and I'd rather just leave them in the city,'' he said.,The maple-covered hillsides, cornfields and rural byways of Ulster County, on the west side of the Hudson about 100 miles north of New York, have long attracted weekenders from the city, mainly those who pride themselves on wanting nothing to do with the social fish bowl of the Hamptons.,But recently a flashier crowd has been arriving, bringing new tastes and status symbols that do not always sit right with more low-key residents. Range Rovers have become an expected rather than a rare sight. Falafel stands, taco shops and jazz bars have opened. ''I've noticed women wearing lipstick, heels and lots of black,'' Mr. Nutley said. ''That's a definite danger sign.'',Mr. Leitch, who has posed with Kate Moss for Calvin Klein and sings with his band, Nancy Boy, at fashion parties, and Ms. Hume, his wife, a Victoria's Secret model, gave up their city digs to relocate full time in Woodstock. They are the latest in a wave of weekenders and transplants from the worlds of fashion and style to buy property in the area. Others include Angela Lindvall, a model; Camilla Nickerson, a senior fashion editor at Vogue; Alexis Borges, a booker at Next models, and Henri Kessler, a  club owner turned film producer.,Kevin West, who chronicles the fashion fabulous for Women's Wear Daily and W magazine, said, ''Upstate New York is now the place where the bellwether of the pack goes.'' He recalled a cocktail party in the Hamptons last summer at which Ulster County was a hot topic. ''It's cheap right now to buy a farmhouse, and the trickle has begun,'' he said. ''In two years, it will be a flood.'',Stone Ridge Liquors changed its name to Stone Ridge Wine and Spirits under a new owner and started selling Jade Mountain Les Jumeaux from California for $30 a bottle. Emmanuel's Marketplace now offers 100 cheeses from Europe, pheasant sausages, organic produce and Greek olives from a barrel. ''In January, we put in a lobster tank,'' said Jim Phillips, the manager.,Mr. Leitch, 31, a son of the Donovan, the 60's folk rocker, plans to concentrate on writing music while his wife, who resembles a Botticelli angel, explores painting and paganism. ''I won't be occupying my normal bar stool at Don Hill's anymore,'' he said.,Once a fixture in gossip columns and Manhattan clubs, dubbed an ''It Boy'' in the mid-90's, Mr. Leitch added: ''I was totally immersed in the whole scene five years ago. But going out is not my No. 1 priority now.'' To celebrate the move to his three-bedroom house last Thanksgiving, he led a New Age drum circle in the woods with 10 pals, including Ione Skye, his sister who is an actress, and Shalom Harlow, a former host of ''House of Style'' on MTV.,Julie Nicholls, a real estate broker who sold Mr. Leitch and Ms. Hume their home, said she had chauffeured around other fashion industry people looking for property, though she would not identify them. ''All I know is that I've worked with lots of beautiful women recently,'' she said.,Compared with the Hamptons or Connecticut, real estate values are a relative bargain: modest farmhouses sell in the $200,000 range.  Weekenders prefer rural homes with privacy and historic character, but full-time residents prefer houses in town. Special touches like chicken coops and fireplaces are prized. The average price of a house bought by weekenders has risen 10 percent in the last two years, to about $160,000, said Harris Safier, a real estate broker who owns Westwood Metes & Bounds, which has three offices in Ulster County.,Besides Woodstock, a town long associated with unreconstructed hippies, the most desirable communities include Olive, High Falls, Stone Ridge (known for its 18th-century Dutch grit-stone houses) and the region northwest of Woodstock in Greene County, which includes the ski areas at Hunter and Windham.,Ms. Nickerson of Vogue and her husband, Neville Wakefield, a writer, recently built a black slant-roofed house reminiscent of a chicken coop in West Kill, in Greene County, with sweeping views of the Catskills. Their guest house is a tepee with heated rocks for warmth. Their architect, Ross Anderson, also designed Isaac Mizrahi's apartment and the Bumble and Bumble hair salon in Manhattan.,''It's a 40-minute round trip to get a pint of milk, and the hills and dales are a protection from the more touristy areas like Windham,'' Ms. Nickerson said. ''I want it to remain private, a real retreat, not like the Hamptons, which is a hideous experience.'',But the desire to keep their neck of the woods undiscovered didn't prevent the couple from displaying the house in a six-page spread in the January Vogue, in which Ms. Nickerson was pictured (from behind, in a bikini bottom) taking an outdoor shower.,Like Ms. Nickerson, many of the fashion folk who have found their way to the area say they have no desire to import a Hamptons-style social whirl, in which the same players who party together in Manhattan continue the fun on the weekend. ''We don't like the Hamptons,'' Mr. Leitch said. ''You see the same people from New York, even those you really don't want to see.'',And yet, habits can be hard to break. Mr. Leitch said he hoped to hold ''dress-up nights'' for friends in Woodstock, similar to the ones he has had in New York, like the recent Bowery Bar party where guests  came in retro ski wear.,One of Ms. Nickerson's friends and house guests, Daryl Kerrigan, the fashion designer, contends that the region is already too crowded with the fabulous set. ''In Ulster County, you see people from New York,'' she said. ''I've run into people at the farmers' market.'',Ms. Kerrigan spends weekends at a her house in Wayne County, Pa., where all she sees is dairy cows and the occasional bald eagle soaring above the Delaware River.,Not far from Ms. Nickerson and Mr. Wakefield's house, Tony Goldman, who owns the Tiffany Hotel in Miami Beach and the SoHo Kitchen and Bar on Greene Street in Manhattan, has bought 27 buildings along Main Street of tiny Maplecrest and is developing the Sugar Maple Resort. Mr. Goldman envisions a kind of arts camp for grown-ups, with studio spaces just five minutes from the Hunter Mountain ski area. ''It's designed to be neither a social scene nor an art scene, but rather a creative environment to energize people spiritually and mentally,'' he said. He hopes to open in the summer of 2000.,Mr. Goldman, too, rejects Hamptons style. ''The scene in the Hamptons is a traffic jam,'' he said. ''There they want to see and be seen as power players. The people upstate are more comfortable with themselves.'',As taxes and property values creep up (the average single-family home in Ulster rose from $146,543 in 1997 to $152,231 last year, according the county's Board of Realtors), there is some resentment of newcomers by longtime residents. ''There is a concern about how their children won't be able to remain,'' said Mr. Safier, the real estate broker, who has lived in the county for 22 years. ''There's always some of this conflict with some of the dyed-in-the-wool locals, people whose families have been here for generations. Some of them work for the county or town. However, there are a lot of carpenters and tradespeople who benefit from the weekend residents.'',Lori Childers, publisher of The Blue Stone Press, a newspaper that covers High Falls, Stone Ridge, Accord, Rosendale and other hamlets, said: ''The local population is very diverse and is not easily split into weekenders, transplants and locals, even though sometimes when people are angry they throw around these words as though they meant something definitive. I see many weekenders trying to find a way to live here as their primary residence.'',''There will always be tensions in a changing and growing community,'' she said. ''Everyone lives here because they love it. This brings even the most different types of people together.'',Last Christmas, Mark Baker, a New York night-life promoter who meditates occasionally at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Karma Triyana Dharmachakra, near Woodstock, visited Henri Kessler's five-bedroom, five-fireplace farmhouse  in Malden-on-Hudson.,Mr. Kessler, who in the 1980's held court with the hard-partying authors Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis as a club promoter for Area and Danceteria, bought his property, called Shatamuck, in November.,''When I'm up there, I'm into fixing my house, boating and taking pilot's lessons,'' said Mr. Kessler, the producer of an independent film,  ''Slam,'' which won prizes at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals last year. ''You can all get together or never see anyone.'',He sometimes spends weekend afternoons with friends who live nearby, Dr. Darwin Bushman, a psychiatrist, and his wife, Rika Okamoto, a principal dancer with the Martha Graham company who is cast in the title role of Steven Spielberg's forthcoming ''Memoirs of a Geisha.'',Dr. Bushman said he used to live a hedonistic existence and was once a fixture at Flowers, the model-y restaurant in New York where Mr. Baker was a host.,''I dated models and led a vacuous life,'' Dr. Bushman said. ''But after years of going out for six hours with nothing to say, I started to attend arts events in search of a woman of culture and substance.'' That is how he met Ms. Okamoto.,His renouncing of his once-vacuous life may not have come a moment too soon. Now, the models are coming to Ulster County. Mr. Baker said he knows about 15 who have bought in the area in the last year.  And Mr. Nutley, the party organizer, said: ''I've seen them walking on the street and speaking their language. They use catch phrases like 'fabulous,' 'darling' and 'fierce.' Now, I'd rather not talk to anyone.''",SUSAN M. KIRSCHBAUM,"FEB. 28, 1999",Yipes!

"Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin was back in a hospital today to receive new treatment for a stomach ulcer, the latest in a series of ailments that have all but sidelined him for several months.,The new health problem was another blow to Mr. Yeltsin's hopes of staging a convincing comeback after months of illness and waning authority, although it was not considered serious enough to force his Prime Minister to cancel plans to go on vacation.,Doctors said they had advised Mr. Yeltsin to stay in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital for a few days after an examination today showed that the ulcer, which forced him to spend two weeks in a hospital in January, had started bleeding slightly again.,''Unfortunately there is a worsening of the stomach ulcer, which has not fully healed,'' Sergei Mironov, the chief Kremlin doctor, said in comments broadcast by the ORT television channel. ''There is of course no threat to the president's life.'',The Kremlin had said on Wednesday that Mr. Yeltsin, 68, had completed his rehabilitation from the ulcer.,But Dr. Mironov said new problems could have been caused by Mr. Yeltsin's workload, including a recent trip to Jordan and meetings with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China on Thursday and the heads of four former Soviet republics on Friday.,''You saw what a full work schedule the President had, especially in the last two days,'' Dr. Mironov said.  ''Of course that had a certain effect. Boris Nikolayevich got a bit tired, of course. Yesterday he did not feel very well, and said he felt some discomfort and weakness.'',The Interfax news agency quoted Dr. Mironov as saying he had told Kremlin aides that the President, often described as a difficult patient who ignores his doctors' advice, should reduce his workload for the next few days.,The presidential press secretary, Dmitri Yakushkin, said Mr. Yeltsin felt ''O.K.'' He said the President had spoken to Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov by telephone from the hospital and told him to go ahead with his planned 10-day holiday in southern Russia.,The ulcer is the latest in a series of complaints, including bronchitis, exhaustion and pneumonia, that have kept Mr. Yeltsin out of public view for much of the last five months. He had quintuple heart bypass surgery in November 1996.",REUTERS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Yeltsin Is Hospitalized Again for Ulcer Treatment,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/world/yeltsin-is-hospitalized-again-for-ulcer-treatment.html
"THE capture this month of the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan has focused new attention on the war he has waged against the Turkish army for 14 years. In recruiting fighters and supporters, Mr. Ocalan has fed on the resentment many Kurds feel for what they consider the Government's unjust discrimination against them. But he could never have built such a potent force without great amounts of help from other countries.,There are many reasons why Mr. Ocalan found foreign supporters for his bloody rebellion against Turkish rule, and why Turkey has resisted his rebellion so fiercely. Some are to be found in history, others in psychology, and still others in geopolitics.,Lurking behind them all, however, is water.,For more than a decade until last October, Mr. Ocalan lived semi-clandestinely in Syria, and the Syrian Government gave him money, arms and political cover. Iraq also helped him, allowing him to build bases along the Iraqi-Turkish border. Neither Syria nor Iraq were embracing his cause out of any love for Kurds; on the contrary, governments in both countries have fiercely repressed their own Kurdish populations.,But Syria and Iraq want water from rivers that spring from Turkish soil. Turkey has given them what it considers ample amounts of water, but rejects what it calls their ''unacceptable claims.'' They have supported Mr. Ocalan's fighters as a way of applying pressure on Turkey to give them more water.,The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers created the ''Fertile Crescent'' where some of the first civilizations emerged. Today they are immensely important resources, politically as well as geographically. Through a system of dams in its southeastern provinces, Turkey controls their flow and is determined not to give up its control. That is one important reason that Turkish leaders have so resolutely refused to grant any autonomy to the Kurdish region, which straddles both rivers.,Few if any countries understand the growing importance of water as fully as Turkey does. In one of the world's largest public works undertakings, Turkey is spending $32 billion for the huge Southeast Anatolia Project, a complex of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric plants. Its centerpiece, the Ataturk Dam on the Euphrates River, is already completed. In the reservoir that has built up behind the dam, sailing and swimming competitions are being held on a spot where for centuries there was little more than desert.,When the project is completed, perhaps in the next decade, it is expected to increase the amount of irrigated land in Turkey by 40 percent and provide one-fourth of the country's electric power needs. Planners hope this can improve the standard of living of six million of Turkey's poorest people, most of them Kurds, and thus undercut the appeal of revolutionary separatism. It will also deprive Syria and Iraq of resources those countries believe they need -- resources that Turkey fears might ultimately be used in anti-Turkish causes.,The region of Turkey where Kurds predominate is more or less the same region covered by the Southeast Anatolia Project, encompassing an area about the size of Austria. Giving that region autonomy by placing it under Kurdish self-rule could weaken the central Government's control over the water resource that it recognizes as a keystone of its future power.,In other ways also, Turkish leaders are using their water as a tool of foreign as well as domestic policy. Among their most ambitious new projects is one to build a 50-mile undersea pipeline to carry water from Turkey to the parched Turkish enclave on northern Cyprus. The pipeline will carry more water than northern Cyprus can use, and foreign mediators like Richard C. Holbrooke, deeply frustrated by their inability to break the political deadlock on Cyprus, are hoping that the excess water can be sold to the ethnic Greek republic on the southern part of the island as a way of promoting peace.,It is no accident that President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey is a water engineer by profession and entered public life as director of the State Waterworks Administration. His background and that of his classmate in engineering school, the late President Turgut Ozal, have done much to make Turkey so water conscious. Both men vigorously supported the Southeast Anatolia Project in the 1980's even though Western countries including the United States refused to provide loans or credits for it because they did not want to alienate Arab countries.,One of the most important developments in the Middle East in the last 20 years has been the emergence of a strong partnership between Turkey and Israel. Both countries have much to gain from it; for Israel water is among the greatest potential benefits. Israel is thirsting for water, and Turkey is overflowing with it. Intensive studies are now under way to see whether tankers, pipelines or other means can be used to send Turkey's water to its new Israeli friends. Not coincidentally, the basis for the Turkey-Israel partnership was laid when Mr. Demirel headed the Turkish Government and another water engineer, Yitzhak Rabin, was in power in Israel. ''If we solve every other problem in the Middle East but do not satisfactorily resolve the water problem, our region will explode,'' Mr. Rabin once said. Other Middle Eastern leaders have agreed. The late King Hussein of Jordan asserted that conflicts over water ''could drive nations of the region to war.'',Turkey may be the world's most water-conscious country, and the Middle East the region where water issues are most urgent. But competition for water, and for the power that control of water represents, is intensifying from Africa and Central Asia to Los Angeles and the Everglades. ''The world's population of 5.9 billion will double in the next 40 to 90 years,'' former Senator Paul Simon has written in a new book titled ''Tapped Out'' that examines global water problems. ''Our water supply, however, is constant,'' he wrote, as ''per capita water consumption is rising twice as fast as the world's population. You do not have to be an Einstein to understand that we are headed toward a potential calamity.'',COUNTRIES that control water are likely to be the big winners of the future. Turkey is among them. Its policies have for years been shaped by a desire to use water to achieve political aims, and the policies are beginning to pay off.,''Water has been used as a means of pressure, for example the Syrians sponsoring Kurdish separatism because they want more water,'' said Ishak Alaton, a visionary Turkish businessman whose company has won the contract to build the water pipeline to Cyprus and is conducting a feasibility study for a pipeline to Israel. ''It can also be used for peace, as we are hoping in Cyprus. You can't overstate its importance. I firmly believe that just as the 20th century was the century of oil, the 21st century will be the century of water.'',Why They Fight,The Kurdish rebellion in Turkey is often presented as one phase of a fight to reclaim and ancient national history that has been thwarted only by arbitrary lines drawn on a map by outside powers.,Turkey, however, sees it differently. Water is power. Turkey has it in abundance. It's neighbors, by and large, do not. And Turkey can turn the spigot on and off for two of it's most important neighbors, Syria and Iraq, through a system of dams in the Kurdish parts of eastern Turkey where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers rise.,These are the rivers, that, since before biblical times, have been able to transorm desert lands into life-giving farmland. And the power that controlling the water bestows is something that Turkey is not prepared to give up, Kurdish insurrection or no.",STEPHEN KINZER,"FEB. 28, 1999","The World; Where Kurds Seek a Land, Turks Want the Water",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/the-world-where-kurds-seek-a-land-turks-want-the-water.html
"MOST dramas have their sub-plots, and the talks that stalled last week over Yugoslavia's torn province of Kosovo were no exception. While the big theme was war and peace in the Balkans, a lesser-noted coda was the complicated bond between Prime Minister Tony Blair's Britain and continental Europe that, just weeks ago, promised a new hope of containing conflagration on the continent's doorstep.,Britain, of course, has always been an ambivalent European, seeking to mold the continent's affairs -- often from the sidelines -- even as it holds onto a special relationship with Washington that long predates European integration.,At first glance, this dual vision seems seeded with conflict. But the course of the Kosovo talks may, in fact, have validated Mr. Blair's desire to keep his options open as he tries to make the case that Britain is a major player.,The suspension of the negotiations on Kosovo until March 15 was first of all a severe blow to the prestige of the American Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, who placed her influence on the line for three straight days in a vain attempt to emulate the American diplomatic success at Dayton, Ohio, that ended the Bosnian war.,But her very presence at the negotiations -- and the use of the threat of American-led NATO bombing to get the talks started -- illuminated another reality. Once again, the Americans had taken a leading role in the negotiations because Europeans, acting by themselves, could not do it on their own.,Nobody ever envisioned such talks without the Americans, but their dominant role at the end was not in the original script, certainly not as seen from here.,The negotiations began under the joint sponsorship of France and Britain -- the two countries that would provide the bulk of a NATO-led ground force (along with American, Russian and other troops) to police a peace settlement. The French and British readiness to commit those forces was seen here as a token not just of Europe's frustration at past American diplomatic high-handedness in the Balkans, but also of a desire to make a new start after the tragic blunders of the recent past.,''This time we are seeing a greater effort by the Europeans to see that they get it right and do not leave it all to the Americans,'' Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research group regarded as close to Mr. Blair's New Labor Government, said as the talks got under way. That in itself was a departure from the earlier days of European embroilment in the breakup of Yugoslavia, when Germany was singled out for its diplomatic clumsiness and Dutch troops under the United Nations flag stood by at the massacre at Srebrenica.,More important, this new sense of joint European endeavor was being ignited just weeks after 11 European nations (including France, but not Britain) launched their single currency, the euro. This accomplishment had challenged Britain to rethink its relationships to the Continent.,Only last week, Mr. Blair nudged his country closer to eventual adoption of the euro by setting out a tentative schedule for joining. But he hedged his plan with so many economic and political caveats that, even if Britons do overcome their aversion to abandoning the cherished pound, their country almost certainly would be the last of the four hold-outs to enter the euro-zone.,The broader implications of that hesitancy had long been apparent to Mr. Blair. As the advent of the new currency approached, he sensed that Britain might wind up on the sidelines. But he had an alternative strategy: to emphasize Britain's military and diplomatic leadership, building on what Britain sees as a privileged position in Washington that enhances its ability to mold Europe's destiny.,THAT was one element in the decision to offer a new European initiative in the Balkans. When Mr. Blair traveled to the French town of St. Malo late last year to meet Lionel Jospin, his French counterpart, he was ''frustrated that the Americans were running the show on Kosovo and the Europeans were not,'' said Mr. Grant. The result was the so-called ''St. Malo initiative'' -- an effort to forge a common European defense policy.,But now, a French diplomat remarked the other day, it seems that the initiative's first tests came a little too soon. Not only did the Americans turn out to have played a larger role than anticipated in the Kosovo talks, but Britain made it abundantly clear that its European commitment was intended to complement, not replace, the time-tested ties to Washington that some British critics depict as a slavish readiness to do Uncle Sam's bidding.,Alone among its supposed European partners, Britain sent its warplanes to bomb Iraq last December, while the rest of Europe -- France in particular -- looked on disapprovingly. And while Mr. Blair and Mr. Jospin foresaw the creation of a pan-European defense industry as part of their initiative, two of Britain's biggest defense contractors went their own way last month, announcing a merger that left potential French and German suitors smarting.,As ever, Britain seems to be carving out its own role -- European by trade and geography, but not in its soul, an island only 22 miles from France that feels closer in strategic and economic philosophy to the United States.,''There are fundamental political and historical differences in the perception of security'' separating Britain and its European partners, said Col. Terence Taylor of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ''And because of these fundamental differences, Britain can stand with the United States where others cannot.'',Indeed, after last month's British defense merger, Josef Joffe, a German newspaper columnist in Munich, remarked that the deal ''will keep Britain going as a global player, which in some respects is more important than being a European power.'',''Europe is doing well on economic integration, but it will not be a strategic partner for some time to come,'' he said.",ALAN COWELL,"FEB. 28, 1999","The World: One Foot in Washington; Britain's in Europe, Sort of",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/the-world-one-foot-in-washington-britain-s-in-europe-sort-of.html
"Q. My boss often tells me I am his best worker. His praise is gratifying, and he backs it up with raises each year. But his attitude that I am irreplaceable makes it difficult for me to take any time off, even when I'm ill. I'm not the only talented worker in the office, but because I am given all the most challenging assignments, I'm the only one with experience doing them. How can I keep my boss's high regard from leaving me stuck at my desk?,A. Maybe your supervisor is an evil management genius, exploiting your work ethic at the expense of your personal life. But more likely, he just doesn't see the problem. ''It's easy for a boss to single in on one person they know they can depend on; it's not done  intentionally, but as a convenience,'' said Gerald E. Holmes, a director of media relations for General Motors who has held several supervisory positions there.,Your first step, then, is to educate the boss. Ask for a meeting, advised Deb Koen, vice president of Career Development Services, a nonprofit agency based in Rochester that provides workplace advice and education. The request will send a signal that you have something serious to discuss, while the meeting itself will give you a chance to lay out the problem.,When explaining the situation, take care not to imply that your boss is the bad guy. Emphasize how much you value his high opinion of you, Mr. Holmes said, adding, ''Make it clear that you appreciate his confidence but that you need to find a way to share the workload.'',To avoid the appearance of whining, Ms. Koen suggests stating the issue, waiting for a reaction and then asking your boss for advice on achieving some balance in your life.,Not that you should expect your boss to have all the answers. ''Certainly you should go in with your own ideas and priorities and  actions that you might want to take,'' Ms. Koen said. ''What are the limits you'd like to see established?'',One possible approach: You could ask that you become a mentor for co-workers -- to prepare them for assuming some of your duties, Mr. Holmes said. ''This would spread the workload,'' he said, ''and build your boss's confidence in other members of the staff.'' The suggestion will make it clear that you are thinking not only of your own interests, but also of ways to make the company stronger.,But even after you discuss the problem, and agree upon solutions, it's up to you to insure that progress is being made. ''Your boss has established a pattern that works  very well for him, and he may cling to that approach because you have been so willing to always accommodate,'' Ms. Koen said. ''Nothing will change without a concerted effort on your part.'',Schedule vacation time, she advised, and stick to it -- ''even if it's just a long weekend.'',The sooner your boss recognizes that even Superman needs the occasional break, the better off everyone will be.,Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

"PRESIDENT RICHARD M. NIXON was a man obsessed. Ample illumination of this comes in new transcripts of tapes secretly recorded in the White House between 1971 and 1973.,The following bits of conversation, previously withheld from the public on grounds of national security, show Mr. Nixon and his aides trying to directly implicate the late President John F. Kennedy in the November 1963 assassination of President Ngo Dihn Diem of South Vietnam.,With that killing, South Vietnam's weak civilian leadership died and ''U.S. policy in Vietnam plunged into the unknown,'' in the words of the authors of the Pentagon Papers, the secret Government history of the Vietnam war published by The New York Times in 1971.,Afterward, Mr. Nixon discussed how to pin the murder on the man who defeated him for the Presidency in 1960, in a vote that Mr. Nixon always considered a stolen election.,Yet not even the President was able to compel the national-security bureaucracy to declassify secrets. The public record available today shows that while American officials, including President Kennedy, approved of the military coup in which President Diem was assassinated, they did not directly order his death.,The tapes were released last week by the National Archives, and transcripts of them were prepared by the privately financed Nixon Presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif.   TIM WEINER,July 1, 1971, the Oval Office. The President sees a silver lining in the publication of the Pentagon Papers, which undermined support for the war:,Nixon: Murder of Diem -- Kennedy decided to go forward and got us involved, and it shows that Kennedy was the one who got us in the damn war. We got the Kennedys in this thing now.,Oct. 8, 1971, the Oval Office. John D. Ehrlichman, the domestic policy chief, suggests that the Presidential aide Charles W. Colson be given the job of digging up embarrassing files:,Ehrlichman: Suppose we get all the Diem stuff and supposing there's something we can really hang Teddy [Kennedy] or the Kennedy clan with. I'm going to want to put that in Colson's hands.,Nixon: Yep.,Ehrlichman: And we're going to really run with it.,Aug. 11, 1971, the Oval Office. The President and Mr. Colson discuss possible Congressional hearings in the wake of the Pentagon Papers' release:,Colson: Can you imagine Averell Harriman [Ambassador at Large under President Kennedy] before that committee, explaining why he didn't get Diem out of Vietnam when he had the chance?,Nixon: I want that out. I want him before the committee. . . . I said that he was murdered, that they murder. . . . I knew what the bastards were up to.,Sept. 18, 1971, the Oval Office:,Nixon: We've got all these people who were involved in this -- and they're all, in one way or another, involved in the assassination of Diem. . . . The Diem incident is perhaps the best [unintelligible], because it involves Harriman, who is [Sen. Edmund M.] Muskie's adviser [in the 1972 Presidential election campaign], and it involves Kennedy. . . .,Ehrlichman: [Richard M.] Helms [Director of Central Intelligence] would have a pluperfect fit.,Nixon: That doesn't bother me a bit. We owe Helms nothing. He owes us everything -- we kept him on. And we're going to let the C.I.A. take a whipping on this. That doesn't bother me a bit and I'm not going to hear that argument from Henry [Kissinger, the national security adviser] or anyone else. This Diem incident's got to get out. It's just got to get out. . . . I want the story of the Diem thing, everything in it -- I want it by the end of next week. That's an order. They will get it to me.  I will personally [tell] the whole story -- I intend to have it -- on the Diem incident. . . . The entire file on the Diem incident.,Ehrlichman: There's some C.I.A. stuff on the Bay of Pigs, apparently, that they will die first before they give us that, I understand. There's also some other stuff, some internal stuff over there --,H. R. Haldeman, chief of staff: I bet.,Ehrlichman: -- that we know about, but getting to it is like that big black block in Mecca, you know. . . . If we could just get a friend in the hierarchy over there who would let us in. . . .,Nixon: I consider it a top priority that I want the Diem story. Also on the Bay of Pigs thing, just -- I want an order to Helms and [deputy C.I.A. director Robert] Cushman that for my purposes, not for public release, I am to have the Bay of Pigs story. Now that's an order. And I expect it in one week, or I want his resignation on my desk. Put it as coldly as that. The Bay of Pigs story, the total story. Tell him I know a lot about it myself. But I've got to have it -- just because I'll be questioned about it myself, and I want to be able to know what to say. The Bay of Pigs story and the Diem story. . . . The whole folderol -- the way it happened, I've just got to know. . . . I will not brook any opposition on this. I've screwed around long enough. I've told Henry [Kissinger] and he has really dropped the ball on this.,March 28, 1973, the Executive Office Building. Despite President Nixon's insistence, secret C.I.A. and State Department files on the Diem assassination and the Bay of Pigs are not made public. The President's frustration continues for months, and years:,Nixon: Did you get the word on the declassification of everything over 10 years? That's got to move fast. And not only [unintelligible] but the other one's important -- on the Bay of Pigs. Just get the damn thing out, will you? That's going to be quite a story -- a few little morsels. Do you agree?,Haldeman: Yeah.,Nixon: Also gets into the Diem murder and the whole Diem thing. Now the war is over and we're not going to take Henry's crap. Henry's a little bit involved in that himself. That's why he doesn't want some of it declassified.,May 13, 1973, the White House. A telephone conversation between the President and Alexander M. Haig, his military adviser. The President, still harping on Diem and the Bay of Pigs, mentions the White House operative E. Howard Hunt, who fabricated diplomatic cables and documents implicating President Kennedy:,Nixon: I think we should just declassify everything going back -- everything that's 10 years old, and declassify the whole Bay of Pigs, plus the Diem thing.  Goddammit, you know, that's -- that can only be helpful. Now you say, ''Well, it'll stir things up in Vietnam.'' The hell with it. You don't like that, huh?,Haig: I'm not sure, sir. I think it's a thing that should be considered. . . .,Nixon: Doggone it, I'd like to do it, because -- look, I have not looked at the Bay of Pigs stuff, but I know there's stuff in there that makes [McGeorge] Bundy [President Kennedy's national security adviser] look like a goddamn -- uh, you know, terrible. . . . Goddammit, you know what happened is, they set in motion a chain of events which resulted in the murder of Diem.,Haig: Oh, there's no question about that. None. . . . In fact, you know, the Vice President's aide was there. He was Lodge's assistant [when Henry Cabot Lodge was Ambassador to South Vietnam].  I talked to him some years ago about that.,Nixon: What'd he say?,Haig: He said . . . the poor guy called Lodge on the phone, and said, ''They're going to kill me, for God's sake, send some Marine guards up here.'',Nixon: This is a good juicy thing to get out. . . . I mean, that was what Hunt was looking into, you know, and screwed it up. But the point is, there's a hell of a record there. Now, somebody -- have you got some trusted person that can look at that goddamn thing, and let's declassify it. It's 10 years old, huh?,Haig: Yes, I can get somebody to do it.,May 14, 1973, the Executive Office Building:,Nixon: I want the Diem, and the Bay of Pigs totally declassified, and I want it done in 48 hours.  Now you tell Haig that. It'll drive him up the wall, too. But I want it done. Do you understand? This is 10 years old! Declassify it. We've got a couple of [expletive] working on this thing. Do you see any reason why it shouldn't be declassified, Ron?,Ronald L. Ziegler, press secretary: No, I see no reason.,Nixon: I want them to get off -- now, Haig is disturbed because of the ironies involved in the murder of Diem. Now listen, this government murdered him.

"After months of being stalked, a Brooklyn woman stabbed and killed her former boyfriend on Friday afternoon when he forced his way into her house and began to beat her, law enforcement officials said.,Assistant District Attorney Dennis Hawkins said the Brooklyn District Attorney's office would decline to prosecute the woman, Aliceson Haile, in the killing of Alwyn Chan, unless new evidence surfaced. He said a witness supported Ms. Haile's account that Mr. Chan attacked her with a three-foot-long sharpened stick.,''There is an issue of self-defense here, she had a court order of protection against this individual, and he should not have been in her house,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''At this point we would need to see other evidence to proceed criminally.'',Ms. Haile, 30, had known Mr. Chan, 45, for nearly two years, dating him on and off until two or three months ago, neighbors and prosecutors said. The relationship involved frequent fights and bickering, said neighbors inside the woman's apartment building on New York Avenue in East Flatbush, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ms. Haile's friends said that she endured almost constant mistreatment and physical attacks, prosecutors said.,After the fights, they said, Mr. Chan, also of East Flatbush, was often at Ms. Haile's door with groceries and presents, and an apology.,But neighbors said the relationship worsened after Ms. Haile began to date one of her former boyfriends again. After that, the neighbors said, Mr. Chan could often be heard yelling to her third-floor apartment from the courtyard.,On Feb. 1, Ms. Haile made a frantic call asking to have Mr. Chan arrested after a fight at her home. She was covered with bruises, said prosecutors who charged Mr. Chan with assault after her call.,The court gave Ms. Haile an order of protection against him, but the next day, Mr. Chan was released on $1,500 bail, pending a court appearance on March 16. Despite the order, he continued to appear at the apartment complex, neighbors said.,Prosecutors described the fatal confrontation: Around 2 P.M. on Friday, as Ms. Haile talked with a friend, Mr. Chan knocked on the door. When she answered it, he pushed his way inside. He was carrying the sharpened stick, and he forced her back and beat her.,Ms. Haile ended up in a corner next to her kitchen window, with Mr. Chan slamming the window's iron security gate into her head, a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said. She grasped a knife on the kitchen counter, the official said, and plunged it into Mr. Chan's side.,A 911 call brought police to the scene.

"Picture Sancho Panza trying to lope forward without Don Quixote and the task of Rich Galen suggests itself as he hits the hustings once more at the head of Gopac, the strategizing and fund-raising vehicle for the conservative revolution once led by Newt Gingrich.,With all those many political windmills still standing out there, Mr. Gingrich is gone, purged from the House Speakership, and Mr. Galen, his sharp-tongued insurgent sidekick, dares not yield to any sense of exhaustion or despair, for there is a fresh campaign to be scouted and waged.,''Be careful what you wish for; you may get it,'' Mr. Galen responds with a grin to Democrats as well as Republicans who admit to him lately how vapid Washington seems with the hyperkinetic Mr. Gingrich gone.,''You miss Newt's political and intellectual energy,'' Mr. Galen concedes only briefly, for he must carry on in the post-Gingrich fray now as Gopac faces the next election with control of the House at stake and the Republicans nursing a mere six-vote majority.,The gemlike flame of the 1994 House Republican victory was nurtured in Gopac, with its well-organized outreach recruiting and training sessions for candidates who stormed into majority power in a historic upset. But now, in carrying Gopac forward, Mr. Galen must help defend the crippled G.O.P. margin in 2000, with Mr. Gingrich off in the wilderness and the party hurting from the failed impeachment trial of President Clinton.,''I think the Republican Party, with some justification, is trying consciously or unconsciously to wean itself from Gingrich -- possibly with too much ardor,'' said Mr. Galen, 52, who exemplifies the capital's permanent political cadre, the lesser-known devotees who endure beyond election results.,''It's not Stalinist, an erasure of history,'' he continued, pondering the party's identity crisis. ''But it's a strong sense that this ain't Newt's party anymore.'',It will be strategists like Mr. Galen and other onetime Gingrich stalwarts who will help tailor any fresh party image. He insists that in his visits to promising precincts, which stretch from county to national candidacies, he finds a party resolved, more than wounded.,''You can't get much lower than we were for the last two and a half months,'' Mr. Galen said of the impeachment struggle. As a maverick conservative, he had proposed an early negotiated settlement by Congressional leaders -- a proposal that saw him instantly excoriated by pro-impeachment Republicans.,He is characteristically unbowed, particularly from the pulpit of his Web page (www.mullings.com), where he has been entertainingly manic in explaining the capital's scandal culture to outsiders.,''We have been spinning and leaking and appearing and predicting and explaining and talking and making up jokes and making up excuses and getting made up and rolling our eyes and counting votes and reading more spicy material than we have since 1971 when we discovered the complete works of D. H. Lawrence were available in the college library under 'Classical Lit,' '' he summarized in one riff, asking, ''Isn't our system great?'',Mr. Galen, who was raised in New Hyde Park, N.Y., is a former radio news reporter who tried politics on a dare, won a city council seat in Marietta, Ohio, and then moved to Washington to become a Congressional and party strategist. He and Mr. Gingrich were cool toward each other at first, but eventually the Speaker had to wonder aloud that they made a good team. ''I told him, 'That's because I'm twice as smart as you thought I was and you're only half as crazy as I thought you were,' '' Mr. Galen fondly recalled.,''I'm finding a fresh burst of energy now because we've gone back to arguing the things we love to talk about,'' he said of tax-cut proposals and the rest of the nonimpeachment agenda that he dearly craves. ''And there ain't nothing better than legitimate Presidential contenders to re-energize a party.'' He expressed confidence that the Republicans could win the White House next year and retain majorities in both houses of Congress.,Beyond that optimism, Mr. Galen predicts ''a good old-fashioned 70's and 80's political cycle,'' with a focus on wholesome issues, and personal scandal relegated to the fringe. He said that the public wanted it that way and that neither party had much to campaign on in their impeachment performances of attacking and defending the President.,''I don't think this is accruing to Republicans anymore,'' he said of the public's resentment of impeachment. ''To the extent that people thought we should be punished, I think we have,'' he said of the shrunken House majority. ''It may well be that the real danger lies with Democrats who so ardently supported Clinton.'',Mr. Galen sounded wistful as he idealized politics as a creative contact sport, not the blood sport it has seemed lately.,''If you're going to be in politics, you have to be an optimist,'' he said, sounding humbled by the banishment of his Speaker, but already busy traveling and strategizing beyond the Gingrich revolution.",FRANCIS X.

"Winthrop K. Edey, who found nothing so fascinating as the mechanical clarity of antique clocks and the minutiae of his own offbeat life, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, near his home on the Upper West Side. He was 61 and had devoted his life to assembling one of the world's finest private collections of clocks and watches and to the extraordinary diary he had kept since he was 6 years old.,His family said the cause was Hodgkin's disease.,If he sometimes seemed eccentric -- and a man who strolled in Central Park wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, short black socks and brown wingtips inevitably would -- Mr. Edey, known as Kelly (a diminutive of his middle name, Kellogg), was simply not bound by life's usual constraints.,As the grandson of Morris W. Kellogg, an engineer who made millions designing and building oil refineries, not to mention the nation's World War II atomic-bomb plants, Mr. Edey was relieved of the need to earn a living. As a result, after growing up in Upper Brookville on Long Island, graduating from Amherst College and studying at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, he spent the rest of his life doing exactly what he felt like doing.,To Mr. Edey, who began taking clocks apart and putting them back together about the time he started his diary as a boy, what he felt like doing was pursuing his childhood interests with devotion.,Along the way, Mr. Edey, whose interest was less in the clocks' decorative cases than in the timeless beauty he saw in their intricate inner workings, became an internationally known expert on antique clocks, and collected them with such a discriminating eye that when he helped the Frick Collection assemble an exhibition of French clocks in 1982, nine of the finest specimens were from his own collection.,A creature of habit, Mr. Edey chose a life of such regularity that friends could set their watches by his schedule. He got up at 5 in the afternoon, and after an evening out with friends (dinner for them, breakfast for him), Mr. Edey would return to his West 83d Street town house and work through the night studying clocks, pursuing a separate and abiding interest in ancient Egypt and writing in his diary.,Described as Proustian in its sweep and attention to detail (Mr. Edey could devote several pages to the ramifications of a friend's failure to return a phone call) the multivolume diary, some of his friends are convinced, will someday be regarded as an important social document of New York life.,If so, it will be partly because Mr. Edey traveled in some heady art circles, befriending the likes of Andy Warhol (who included Mr. Edey in his 1963 underground movie, ''The 13 Most Beautiful Boys'') and Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as prominent gallery owners, museum officials and collectors.,Mr. Edey also developed a passionate interest in photography, assembling a small but impressive collection of photographs by Man Ray and others, and taking pictures of his own, generally New York street scenes and foreign landscapes.,Typically, Mr. Edey, a fussy sort who favored old-fashioned fountain pens over ballpoints and maintained his town house in such 19th century purity that it still has its original working gas jets, tapestries, stove, and marble-slab kitchen table, was not one to whip out a little Leica when he spotted an appealing scene on his extensive travels. Instead he, or rather his hapless traveling companion of the moment, would lug a huge wooden turn-of-the-century view camera complete with tripod and 11-by-14-inch glass plates. Although he continued to take pictures, which often had a dark, moody quality, after an exhibition in the early 1970's, Mr. Edey did not pursue photography professionally.,Mr. Edey is survived by a brother, Maitland, of Vineyard Haven, Mass., and two sisters, Beatrice Phear of Cambridge, Mass., and Marion Edey of Silver Spring, Md.,Mr. Edey, who began buying antique clocks before they became a collecting rage, continually refined and improved his collection of about 60 clocks and watches, 39 of which he has given to the Frick Collection, along with his diaries.,Pending an appraisal, Edgar Munhall, the Frick curator, would not venture a guess on how many millions the clock collection might be worth, but after taking a glance he suggested that the real treasure might be the diaries, whose publication future is yet to be determined.",ROBERT MCG.

Is this wine from New York State, they might ask, or the Mosel region of Germany?,Mr. Wiemer, who transplanted himself from Bernkastel, on the Mosel, started his estate at Dundee, on Seneca Lake, in 1973. His rieslings are so authentic that an occasional failure can be more interesting than another producer's success.,The '96 semidry riesling is delicious. It is full-bodied and exhibits the flavors of a fat Italian peach and dried apricots plus the tantalizing lanolin aroma characteristic of aging rieslings. Its brisk acidity and long finish prolong the pleasures. Nancy's Wine for Food, 313 Columbus Avenue (75th Street), a Manhattan vault of riesling, charges $12.,Although Wiemer's '97 dry riesling is partly mute, it too is attractively redolent of peaches in the bouquet and flavor, and is perfect as an apertif and at dinner time.,To be most savory, both wines should be lightly cool; riesling acidity, when emphasized by iciness, turns a wine that's an asset into a liability.

"When William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States, gaveled the Clinton scandal into history on Feb. 12, those with a curatorial bent began wondering what will happen to the objects of the President's affection -- the artifacts that may testify to Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky long after both of them are gone. Whither the gifts -- the hatpin, ''Leaves of Grass,'' the Black Dog T-shirt -- and, yes, the Dress? What provisions are being made for their perpetuation in the curious gallery of anti-relics by which Presidential scandals and fiascoes live on in glass cases and the public imagination?,''It's tough to say what's going to happen to the dress,'' admits Steven Tilley, who for the past two decades has worked with the holdings at the National Archives that relate to the Kennedy assassination, Watergate and the various independent-counsel investigations that followed. The dress may yet, of course, figure in criminal proceedings against the President, but eventually, Tilley said, ''we would assume we'd get it. If we do, then we're going to retain it as a piece of evidence from this very, very visible and highly interesting investigation.'',A spokeswoman for the office of the independent counsel says that ''normally'' such subpoenaed items go ''back to the rightful owner,'' but adds that the disposition of Monica miscellanea has not been settled. ''Legal research is being done right now,'' she says, referring to all the materials held by the various independent counsels. Tilley adds that, so far, discussions between the archives and Ken Starr's operation have involved only documents, not wearables, and not the book of Whitman poems that Monica called ''the most sentimental'' of the President's presents.,If Congress, as many expect, refuses to renew the Independent Counsel Act, civil libertarians may cheer, but some historians are likely to sigh with regret. Since Watergate -- our first fully curated Presidential scandal -- special prosecutions have assured the survival of a whole Grand Guignol of historic illegality. The archives, for instance, preserves much of the paraphernalia used by the 1972 Watergate burglars and in the cover-up that followed: Bernard Barker's address book, Chap Stick tubes with hidden microphones and all the office equipment involved in what Tilley calls ''the Rose Mary stretch,'' the gymnastic explanation offered by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, of how she erased 18* minutes of tape. Advances in office technology yielded the archives some computer hard-drives from Oliver North's offices at the National Security Council.,Tilley says that the Nixon and Reagan libraries have never requested the loan of any Watergate or Iran-contra items for use in an exhibit on either subject. But a number of Presidential librarians point out that these institutions balance their scholarly and memorial aspects with more candor than one might suspect. The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., has just acquired the staircase that led toward the evacuation helicopters taking off from the American Embassy in Saigon. Richard Norton Smith, the museum's director, admits that while Ford was pleased to get the object, some of the institution's trustees did not want to own something so associated with, if not scandal, then at least national humiliation.,Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, recalls how L.B.J., not too long before his death, judged some antiwar citizen mail being marked for a Vietnam display not nearly ''mean enough.'' He urged the librarians to substitute more evocatively abusive items, including one postcard that read: ''I demand that you as a gutless son of a bitch resign as President of the U.S.'' Middleton says he has ''tried very, very hard'' to find the infamous stuffed ballot box that may have helped send ''Landslide Lyndon'' to the Senate in 1948.,Because Judith Campbell's name appears on handwritten logs of both telephone calls and appearances at the White House visitors gate, the John F. Kennedy Library could not eliminate this Presidential girlfriend from the historical record. Before the existence of Government-run libraries (there are none prior to Herbert Hoover's), it was easier to clean up after the Chief Executive. The biographer Carl Sferrazza Anthony points out that after Warren G. Harding's sudden death in 1923, the President's secretary, George Christian, probably destroyed photographs of the President's mistress and illegitimate daughter, which Harding kept in his Oval Office desk.,Materials from the Clinton trial will remain the property of the Senate that conducted it. The curved tables at which the House managers and White House lawyers sat have been marked, so that their historical function will not be forgotten after the furniture is moved and used elsewhere. The deposition videotapes will go to the archives, along with one of the misprinted pens -- Untied States Senator, says the barrel -- used by the legislators to sign their oath as jurors. The object may eventually join a handful of highly select materials in the sliding metal drawers of the Archives' legislative division, which includes the now-much-discussed censure of Andrew Jackson and its later repeal. The depth of feeling in Jackson's day is simply not graspable without looking at his censure: the angrily literal expunction is written right across the offending language in the original document. The tally sheet for Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial, during which Senator Edmund G. Ross displayed his profile in courage by casting the deciding vote for acquittal, rests in another drawer. (Lest all this seem excessively majestic, the archivists direct a visitor's notice to a different sort of item carefully wrapped in plastic: the first issue of Mad magazine, hauled before a 1950's Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency.),Skip Rutherford, local planning coordinator for the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark., concedes that this future facility will have to address the events that led to impeachment. If it were up to Rutherford personally, neither the gifts nor the dress would be exhibited, but all such decisions will be made by professionals at some later time. ''We don't even have an architect on board yet,'' he says.,The dress may be an extreme example of memorabilia, but the impulse to preserve it is still more healthy than prurient. For one thing, its existence determined the entire course of the scandal. More important, in an age of virtual reality (even virtual, videotaped witnesses), it remains grotesquely real, almost literally alive with its stain of Presidential DNA. It is a messy, assertive fact that no amount of photography and digitalization could hope to replicate. And it is the same with the gifts. No matter how cheap or goofy or exquisite, they evoke the connection between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky far more compellingly than, say, the computerized records of hush money might have. The Black Dog T-shirt is not an object to inspire much awe or heartbreak -- like, say, the string with which Lincoln repaired his own spectacles, preserved in a box at the Library of Congress -- but like it or not, it, too, now belongs to the ages.",THOMAS MALLON,"FEB. 28, 1999",Will Monica Ever Get Her Blue Dress Back?,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/will-monica-ever-get-her-blue-dress-back.html

"WHEN Jack Garvey lay down John Grisham's ''Partner'' before falling asleep several years ago, he had no hint that his novel-reading days were over. But when the letters started floating on the page the next morning, he learned that he had macular degeneration, an irreversible condition that affects more than 10 million Americans 55 and older. Mr. Garvey, who said he was older than 60, and who owns a real estate business here, bought himself a machine that could magnify letters 35 times, but his disease outpaced the machine's ability to help him. Even now, his blue eyes give no hint of trouble as he describes the frustration of not being able to read on his own.,Rita Grunbaum, 88, learned she had macular degeneration two years ago. An car accident then compounded her eye problems, leaving her to read laboriously with a magnifying glass. Recorded books do not appeal to her, Ms. Grunbaum said, because, as a former photographer, ''I'm a very visual person; I like to see.'',Now, a magnification device the size of a personal computer is helping people like Ms. Grunbaum and Mr. Garvey regain their visual independence. The machine, donated to the Larchmont Public Library by the Charles A. Mastronardi Foundation, a private family foundation in Mamaroneck, uses a combination of optics and electronics to magnify texts or photographs from 4 to 100 times.  Readers can choose from several foreground and background colors and can easily control their reading speed; the machine works as well with personal papers, newspapers and magazines as it does with books.,Similar devices are proving popular elsewhere in the county. The Chappaqua Library, White Plains Public Library, Katonah Village Library and the Yonkers Public Library's Will Branch all own machines that magnify texts. The Getty Square branch in Yonkers has a Kurzweil reading machine, which reads printed materials aloud as well as magnifying print. Not everyone who uses the machines has a serious eye condition. Gloria Arana, who came to Larchmont from Ecuador last December, can often be found in the library corner here where the magnification device is kept. ''I love to read,'' she said, ''but I frequently lose my glasses.''",ROBERTA HERSHENSON,"FEB. 28, 1999","When the Eyes Fail, a Magnifying Device Sends a Ray of Light",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/when-the-eyes-fail-a-magnifying-device-sends-a-ray-of-light.html
"In a state always abuzz with trends aborning, Santa Barbara remains a placid throwback to the quieter days of the California dream. With its old Spanish and Craftsman-style homes, acres of lush landscaping and laid-back beach, it's a perfect place to be reminded of the Golden State as it once was. In winter,  crowds are lighter and the weather is still often glorious, if less reliably perfect than in the longer, warmer days of summer.,From Montecito, the quiet enclave on the city's southeast end that is the playground of movie stars and old-money golfers, to the wine country stretching northwest from town into the Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara's natural beauty remains remarkably unspoiled. The University of California campus in suburban Goleta adds a stimulating college-town feel, and as the biggest cultural beachhead between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city has more than its share of artistic attractions.,Over a decade ago, in an effort to boost off-season tourism, city officials helped start a winter film festival. Now the city's official tourism organization is known as the Santa Barbara Conference and Visitors Bureau and Film Commission. The festival opens Thursday and runs for 11 days, with more than 125 films, including 18 world premieres, to be screened in various downtown locations. The festival does not yet rival Sundance or Cannes for star wattage, but its location just 90 minutes north of Los Angeles means it draws plenty of interest. This year it will honor Sally Field with a newly created award, with salutes to Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould.,The festival opens with a free block party on the State Street mall downtown, and the opening film is the premiere of ''This Is My Father,'' a love story starring Aidan Quinn, John Cusack, James Caan and Stephen Rea. The closing-night film is ''Alegria,'' the first feature film inspired by Cirque du Soleil, the international circus-arts ensemble.,In between, the event encompasses everything from ''An Evening With Bruce Vilanch,'' a wild-eyed comedy writer responsible for jokes on countless awards shows, to a screenwriting seminar with Nora Ephron, Carrie Fisher, Gary Ross (author of ''Big'' and ''Pleasantville'') and Marc Norman (co-author of ''Shakespeare in Love'').,Though organizers expect most events to sell out, the public can buy tickets to screenings at the door; passes start at six tickets for $45. Special events and seminars, priced separately, require reservations. Call (805) 963-0023, fax (805) 962-2524; www.sbfilmfestival.com.,Events,One of the film festival sites is the  Arlington Theater, downtown at 1317 State Street, a 2,000-seat 1931 movie palace with a trompe l'oeil star-studded ceiling that creates the illusion of a night sky. It is also home to the Santa Barbara Symphony, under the direction of Gisele Ben-Dor. The orchestra has weekend performances this winter, featuring a program of  Beethoven and Mozart on March 20 and 21, including Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and Mendelssohn and Rossini arias on April 10 and 11. Performances Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Saturday tickets, $17 to $39, Sunday, $17 to $30. Call (805) 963-4408.,The 680-seat Lobero Theater at 33 East Canon Perdido Street, (805) 963-0761, bills itself as ''the best place to see anything.'' On March 26 at 8 P.M. the theater will present ''Vincent,'' a one-man show about Vincent van Gogh; $15 or $25. For $100, a package includes the play and a bus trip to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's van Gogh exhibit.,The Santa Barbara Grand Opera Association stages ''Madama Butterfly,'' at the Lobero April 23, 25, 29 and May 1. Performances at 7:30 P.M., except 2:30 P.M. on April 25. Tickets: $38.50 and $48.50.,Sightseeing,The Santa Barbara Mission, the queen of the chain of religious outposts begun by Padre Junipero Serra, opened in 1786, two years after his death. Tucked into a hillside above town, the mission and its grounds offer a musty, mystical glimpse of life among the Spanish priests and their Chumash Indian converts. The church, at 2201 Laguna Street, is still active. Call (805) 682-4713 for information; tours are $3, with children free. Open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., but Sunday Masses mean no tours of the church until after 1:15 P.M.,In the heart of downtown, an architectural gem from a more modern era, the Santa Barbara County Courthouse, 1100 Anacapa Street, (805) 962-6464, is a great spot for getting oriented. The Spanish-Moorish structure, finished in 1929 as part of the rebuilding after a 1925 earthquake, helped set the style for much of downtown. Hand-painted ceilings, wrought-iron chandeliers and giant murals all capture the feeling of old California, and the 80-foot tower offers panoramas of the city and ocean. Open weekdays 8 A.M. to 4:45 P.M., weekends and holidays 10 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Free tours Monday to Saturday at 2 P.M.; Monday, Tuesday and Friday also at 10:30 A.M.,An excellent way to see Santa Barbara is by bicycle or the old-fashioned bicycle-surreys available for rent throughout downtown. At least one rental shop, Santa Barbara Beach Rentals, (805) 963-3700, will deliver bikes to your hotel, and many hotels either rent bikes or provide them free for guests.,One of the best of the many bike paths runs along the ocean from Montecito past the downtown beach front and up a gentle hill by the Santa Barbara City College campus to Shoreline Park. Another well-marked bike lane runs up State Street from the harbor to the mission, where you can follow ''Scenic Drive'' signs for the route that winds steeply along Alameda Padre Serra through the hills and back toward Montecito. Be prepared to pedal hard and watch for cars.,Unlike most California cities, Santa Barbara is also built for the sheer joy of strolling: one great pleasure is walking along State Street, with its El Paseo arcade, a charming example of 20's Spanish-style architecture; antiques stores and used-book shops line the side streets.,Exhibits at the Sea Center, 211 Stearns Wharf, (805) 962-0885, operated by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, are particularly suited to children. At the Touch Tank, they can handle fish, invertebrates and plants collected from local waters. Open October through May, Tuesday to Friday noon to 5 P.M.; Monday 11 A.M. to 2 P.M.; weekends and holidays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. (Touch Tank, noon to 4 P.M.); expanded summer hours.

It's bright and cheery, but its proximity to the ocean and terrific restaurant, Citronelle, where breakfast is served for guests (not included in room rates), are the main draws here. Doubles: $159 to $219 for ocean view rooms with king bed.,The Montecito Inn, built by Charlie Chaplin, is a charming old roadside inn set just blocks back from the beach, at 1295 Coast Village Road in the heart of Montecito's upscale art galleries, cafes and shops. Because it abuts the 101 Freeway and railroad tracks, it can be a bit noisy, and its 60 old rooms and suites are smallish. But it has been lovingly restored with charm aplenty, plus a good restaurant and bar. Doubles from $185;  (800) 843-2017, fax (805) 969-0623.,Budget: A new 61-room Holiday Inn Express has just opened at 17 West Haley Street, in a former single-room-occupancy hotel, and offers the basic accommodations that chain is known for, within walking distance of downtown. Doubles: $119 to $159; (800) 549-1700, fax (805) 963-1747.,Just blocks from the beach downtown, the Country Inn by the Sea, 128 Castillo Street, is a charming vine-covered motel. The 47 rooms are done up in a European style, with chintzes and pine furnishings, some with canopied beds. Weekday doubles: $79 to $119, weekends $119 to $159, with Continental breakfast;  (805) 963-4471, fax (805) 962-2633.,Luxury: The Four Seasons Biltmore, 1260 Channel Drive, is a grande dame of coastal resorts. The summer headquarters for the senior staff of the Reagan White House, this sprawling compound facing the beach is formal but relaxed. Rooms  are in the main building and a series of cottages linked by winding, landscaped paths; La Marina, the formal restaurant, has topnotch food and spectacular views. The 217 rooms, in country Mediterranean style, range from $395 for doubles with garden views to $490, with fireplaces and ocean views; lower midweek rates sometimes available; (805) 969-2261,  fax (805) 565-8323.,The San Ysidro Ranch, 900 San Ysidro Lane, (800) 368-6788, fax (805) 565-1995, is an outpost of casual luxury and rustic elegance where Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh were married and John and Jacqueline Kennedy spent part of their honeymoon. The cottages have wood-burning stoves or fireplaces and are scattered through orange trees and flower beds, with another 400 acres left open for hikes or riding. Its 38  rooms are not cheap, $350 to $3,000, but the resort offers every amenity, from 24-hour room service to spa treatments.,Where to Eat,Citronelle, 901 East Cabrillo Boulevard, (805) 963-0111, Michel Richard's ocean-view restaurant, sets the culinary bar for Santa Barbara. Specialties include fresh blue-crab salad in an avocado nest and braised lamb shank with white beans and black olive sauce. We had an outstanding chef's tasting menu (which, at $70 a person with wine, is also an outstanding value) featuring baby salmon with gaufrette potatoes and roasted venison chop with black-currant sauce. Dinner for two is about $150, with wine from the ample list, which, like most restaurants here, features lots of Santa Ynez Valley selections.,You don't have to be a guest at the San Ysidro Ranch to eat at the Plow and Angel Bistro, 900 San Ysidro Lane, Montecito, (805) 969-4100. This cozy rathskeller with roaring fireplace is a great way to sample the resort's rarefied pleasures without the nightly tariff. You can order every item served in the fancier Stone House upstairs, like corn-crusted Pacific oysters, lemon-lime salmon and achiote-rubbed chicken. Dinner for two with modest wine: $150 (one-third that for bar fare).,The cozy Montecito Cafe, 1295 Coast Village Road, (805) 969-3392, is  always packed with local residents, who come for the Cal-American menu and reasonable prices on dishes like goat-cheese pancakes with salmon and caviar, and grilled chicken breast with Anaheim chilies, red onion, tomato and cream. Dinner for two with great local wine: $80.,You can take a seat at one of the picnic tables under the awning at La Super-Rica, 622 North Milpas Street, (805) 963-4940, and enjoy mouth-watering, freshly prepared Mexican food that keeps long lines stretched out the door at this famous taqueria,  blessed by Julia Child. There is no better place to sample rich and brothy pinto beans with bacon, delicate chiles rellenos or, Wednesday to Saturday, fresh tamales in light cream sauce. Huge lunch or dinner for two with beer, $20; cash only.,Right on the sand, Shoreline Cafe, 801 Shoreline Drive, (805) 568-0064, is a low-key hangout perfect for pancakes made with orange juice, or a grilled shark burrito or mussel pasta salad with a margarita at sunset.

"WHAT sort of instruments would the musicians be playing at an American Classical Orchestra performance?,''If we were playing Bach's Brandenburg Concertos,'' said Thomas Crawford, ''there would be recorders instead of flutes, gambas in addition to cellos, always a harpsichord, a corno da caccia, a violino piccolo and an English horn-type instrument called a taille.'',For Beethoven's ''Emperor'' Piano Concerto, the main difference is the keyboard instrument. In Beethoven's day, it was a fortepiano. ''It's a totally different instrument,'' said Mr. Crawford. ''A modern piano has a metal frame and it sustains the tones far better. It has a loud pedal. Beethoven's piano had a pedal, but it was a wood frame and the sound was more incisive, percussive.'',In the 18th century the pianist was often in the middle of the orchestra, or even at the back. But the most profound contrast between a period performance and a modern one is that the soloist plays the entire concerto from start to finish. ''Beethoven would be playing along with the orchestra, every note in addition to the solo stuff,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''It's a matter of treating the soloist as part of the ensemble.'',Most modern performances have the pianist sitting patiently for the sometimes lengthy orchestral introduction to the piano's grand entrance. Typically this off and on participation of the soloist continues throughout the concerto. So the period performance is more visually dynamic and all-inclusive.,The instruments used today for an early music performance would be original or reproduction 18th century, with natural gut strings, woodwinds with fingerholes as opposed to keys and valveless brasses. Modern orchestras would double the size of the string section, which in Beethoven's day numbered around 18 violins, 4 violas, cellos and basses. There are still the same number of brasses and winds as the music specifies on a part.   VALERIE CRUICE",VALERIE CRUICE,"FEB. 28, 1999",What's Different?

Ms. O'Brien has produced more than 100 Shakespearean plays and introduced Shakespeare to 2,000 middle and high school students.,''She's a pied piper,'' Ms. Zambrano said. ''I had never acted before. She draws people to it -- the kids adore her.'' Ms. Zambrano remembers with affection what she calls a ''great, great experience.'' She can still say her lines, not by parroting them, but with the character motivation and underlying meaning of a play that Ms. O'Brien took the time to explain.,Dee O'Brien has been an English teacher at Hommocks Middle School since 1971.

When I woke up, all I had was the clothes I had the night before, no toothbrush, no makeup, so it was not my idea of a conventionally pretty moment. I felt really small on that huge bed and that bedspread saturated with surreal color you wouldn't want in your own house. I wondered what Josh could see through the wide-angle lens. He was examining me, and I was examining myself. I was excited about starting a relationship, but terrified that he was going to see right into me.

"It was only a coincidence that I was reading Norman Podhoretz's new memoir, ''Ex-Friends,'' when Sidney Blumenthal and Christopher Hitchens started throwing affidavits at each other. Podhoretz's book is a crisp account of his years among the New York intellectuals in the 1960's, 70's and 80's. He relates how his ideological shift from left to right turned lively friendships -- with Lillian Hellman and Norman Mailer, among others -- into bitter relics. And when I thought of Sid and Hitch, as their friends (and I'm one) call them, possibly falling into that same politicized sand trap, it was hard not to feel a little sad. Although both have friends of a feather, each knows, I think, that a shared politics isn't a precondition of friendship. It can even be a complication.,Maybe it's because I'm a member of what Michael Lind once called the Generation of 1989 that I feel estranged from this kind of conflict. Since the end of the cold war, the consequences of disagreement seem so much less profound than they did in Podhoretz's heyday. So as ideology has seeped out of our politics, the chance of friendships despite politics seems greater. And so the fun that Podhoretz misses from his youth surely is more possible for my generation, and Hitch and Sid's grudge more arbitrary.,But beyond that, ending a friendship over politics calls into question how real the friendship was in the first place. True friendship, after all, often takes wing when you realize that you don't share another person's politics, but decide you like her anyway. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott once wrote that friendship consists in ''the absence of any desire to change or improve'' the other person. It contains at its core the freedom of disagreement, not the pressure to conform.,Most of my best friends, I find, are raving liberals. And we have a nice way of getting along. They playfully condescend to me and I playfully condescend to them. Then we talk about the latest episode of ''The PJ's.'' And some of my friends are archconservatives. We spend a few hours skating awkwardly around the Defense of Marriage Act and then order another beer.,When I think of my ''ex-friends,'' several categories come to mind. There are the exhausted friends, people who live too far away to keep in close touch with. There are the mistakes, who didn't hack it, or changed beyond recognition. Or ''phone fade-outs,'' who just stopped returning my calls. And then there are the handful of enemies, who behaved unspeakably and with whom it is sadly impossible to have any further contact at all.,But comrades turned traitors? Hardly any. Every now and again some issue comes along that seems to be life or death, and I catch a glimpse of those Pod-Hitch-Sid conniptions. I remember in the early 1990's, I was friends with a bunch of gay radicals in New York and a couple of closet cases in Washington. When the former group decided to ''out'' the latter, my post-ideological socializing broke down. I sided with the closet cases -- not because I knew them better, or admired them more, but because I found that the principle counted more than the relationship. But even then, the principle wasn't very abstract. I just found it hard to be friends with people, whatever their beliefs, who could act with what I thought was open-eyed cruelty.,One solution, perhaps, is for people who are passionate about politics to avoid passionately political friends. This is tricky in Washington, but even here, plenty of people can separate the personal from the political. Of my closest friends, one plays jazz piano for a living and one owns an animation company; another is a Jesuit in training and a fourth is a personal trainer. Their politics vary, but their personal center is located somewhere deeper than the latest editorial in The Nation or The Weekly Standard. Still, I wouldn't be any more likely to break with them if they were hard-line ideologues. And this isn't because I lack firm political convictions. It's because one of those convictions is that politics isn't life.,Another is that one of the points of a liberal democracy is to create and enlarge the private space where friendships breathe and grow. Friendship can exist anywhere, of course -- in neoconservative cabals, post-modern literary departments, army battalions. But it is purest when public regimentation recedes and private sensibility begins. And thus to saturate friendship with politics is to threaten its very nature, to subject it to a public realm to which it does not truly belong.,I think of George Orwell, whose recently published papers I've also been reading. He comes across as a man of deep conviction, but also fundamentally antisocial. He was never part of a set. His few friendships -- with Stephen Spender, for example -- seemed grounded in something deeper than solidarity. And this gave him a bravery that made him able to make public enemies, without making ex-friends.

"Certainly there are invitations one must decline: pancakes with Pol Pot, a cookout in hell with Roy Cohn. But when this sanction is promiscuously applied -- like when members of Congress snub the State of the Union address -- it becomes more posturing than principle.,Shunning everyone with whom you disagree limits your options not only for dining but also for self-expression. Eartha Kitt shocked observers when she dined at the White House in 1968 -- and took the opportunity to criticize Lyndon Johnson for his Vietnam policy. But she was practicing democracy.,Your wife might enjoy that opportunity, but can you get her to the dinner? James Boswell faced a similar predicament in 1776 when he and Samuel Johnson were invited to dine alongside a man Johnson detested. ''If I had come upon him with a direct proposal, 'Sir, will you dine in company with Jack Wilkes?' he would have flown into a passion,'' Boswell wrote. Instead, he mentioned an invitation and merely hinted about objectionable company. Johnson replied: ''Do you think I am so ignorant of the world, as to imagine that I am to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table? . . . I am sorry to be angry with you; but really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever, occasionally.'' Only then did Boswell warn, ''I should not be surprised to find Jack Wilkes there.'' Having made a show of his worldliness, Johnson was trapped. ''And if Jack Wilkes should be there,'' he muttered, ''what is that to me sir?'' That evening Johnson was affable, witty and unambiguous in his opinions -- a delight to all the guests, including Wilkes.,Is attending the dinner an endorsement of another guest? The answer is: It depends on what you do when you get there. A successful dinner party requires lively conversation, not artificial consensus, so go, but speak your mind. And don't be seduced by the Wilkes seated beside you. Note that Johnson said ''occasionally.'',''Should Christ get a longer free ride than Santa Claus? I told my daughter (age 7) that Santa is a wonderful character invented by adults. She took it pretty well, and then she asked, 'Is Jesus just a character, too?' Should I really saddle her with my doubt on a subject that big?'',Contrary to the warning flashed before certain TV shows, all themes are suitable to a younger viewer: love and death, blood and terror, treachery and betrayal -- hence the enduring appeal of Grimms' fairy tales. But younger children not only accept a brief and general explanation, they prefer it.,Start by telling her what other people think. Some believe Jesus was a man who became a legend. Others believe every word about him. Tell her what you think, too, doubts and all.,Children live in a moral universe, and their questions deserve answers. When my Younger Viewer asked if the tooth fairy slipped that money under her pillow, I asked what she thought. She ventured that it was her parents. ''Do you really want me to tell you?'' I asked, giving her a chance to continue the fantasy. But when she demanded an answer, I gave it to her: The money is from our Lord and Saviour, Ernest Borgnine, whose face I just saw in a chef's salad at Denny's.",RANDY COHEN,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Way We Live Now: 2.28.99 -- The Ethicist; Dinner-Party Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-2.28.99-the-ethicist-dinner-party-politics.html
"Less than three months after tobacco companies raised the price of cigarettes by 45 cents a pack (to pay for their $206 billion settlement with the states), President Clinton has proposed an additional 55-cent levy. That could push the price of cigarettes to $4 or more in many parts of the country.,These Federal taxes are designed in part to discourage smoking, but the Government may have become just as dependent on tobacco as many smokers are. In New York City, where a pack of Marlboros can cost as much as $3.50 (depending on the retailer), Federal, state and city taxes account for $1.20. By way of comparison, the shocking sum of $883 million that states' lawyers will earn this year from tobacco settlements adds up to only 4 cents a pack. For its part, according to David Adelman, an industry analyst, Philip Morris pockets 28 cents a pack, after taxes, on Marlboros.,Despite all these added charges and legal hassles, of course, tobacco remains an extraordinarily profitable business. Which doesn't stop industry leaders from depicting themselves as victims -- along with the helpless consumers -- of the Government's taxation habits.

"Berg: In America, we create our own royalty. We give them fame and fortune and the latitude to do whatever they want to do, and in return, we claim the right to scrutinize them. That is part of the pleasure of having the hero for a lot of people. Charles Lindbergh was turned into a god against his will. But people after a few years began to look for flaws, and in fact he revealed some himself. For some people it was a great relief.,Echols: And Janis Joplin encouraged the plumbing and plundering of her own personal life. She was keenly aware of the public's desire for story after story of her flamboyant exploits and her underlying unhappiness. She even told a reporter for Rolling Stone that people like their blues singers miserable. She was very much attached to the idea that her audience was buying a whole package. And she demanded that the press cover it.,Advertising one's flaws can work in celebrities' favor, by establishing a kind of false intimacy. On the other hand, elusiveness can really feed fame -- which accounts for the public's fascination with Hillary Clinton. I mean, everybody wants to know what the hell she's thinking and feeling.,Berg: That's part of the reason the impeachment really went nowhere. It's not true that people have an insatiable appetite for gossip and misery. We only want to know so much.,Echols: Still, someone is going to write a killer biography of Clinton. There are just so many layers to him. What got to be a bore was his sexuality, which proved dreary and depressing. We want our celebrities to live large and have huge appetites. They should be miserable, but by God, when they have sex they should have fun. His stock would rise if he had an affair with a movie star.,Berg: Which raises the question that since there are no Marilyn Monroes and Bill Clinton is not J.F.K., has the coin of celebrity been devalued? Movie stars ain't what they used to be.,Echols: It also raises the question of whether certain flaws are more acceptable than others. We tend to forgive flaws we can accept in ourselves, flaws that can be attributed to something like low self-esteem.,Berg: That's right. Some celebrities revealing some flaws make us feel better. Others, such as Woody Allen, reveal something we don't want to know about human behavior.,Echols: It's more than that -- we want celebrities to be not just flawed but spectacularly flawed. It's a leveling impulse, but it's also a desire to elevate them. To see them have so many lovers, so many drugs, so much dysfunction. A few people seem to be immune to that impulse. Right now, Colin Powell is above scrutiny. Once he's dead, though, everyone's fair game. Also, when a rock star OD's. We have these moments of collective hand-wringing and fleeting contrition, but it doesn't last in the face of the great desire to know more, to know everything.,Berg: I saw that when I wrote my book. In some ways I feel that I shattered Lindbergh's image. I hear from people who were really disillusioned. Then again, a lot of people are angry that it isn't worse.,Echols: Yes, you see it in the way people respond to biographies -- the flaws are really part of the appeal. Part of what makes Janis Joplin such a great figure is here we have this girl who had acne, who had frizzy hair, and she made it, against all odds.,Berg: So she becomes a Scarlett O'Hara, and Charles Lindbergh becomes an Achilles. As time passes, some monuments from each period remain standing because they have come to symbolize the virtues and vices of an era. And what it all comes down to: they're really good stories. There is that to be said. We've been talking fancy all evening, but it really does boil down to who's got a good story.

"Q: Once the deal with At Home Network goes through, you'll be worth -- on paper, at least -- something like $51 million. Does extreme wealth look the way you might have imagined it would?,You know, it's funny. When you're a little kid, what do you think about when you think about millionaires? 'Cause you watch cartoons, or at least I did, you think they're supposed to live in big mansions with gates and stuff like that. I still live in a little one-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto. I still stay at work really late. I still go home to this apartment. I think the feeling of change comes in the little things.,Like what?,Like when the company was first starting up, we couldn't go out for dinner at all.,We had the 50-pound bags of rice and beans, and Taco Bell was sort of the treat. It's nice to be able to go out to dinner. I know that sounds trite. The major way my life has changed, honestly? I go out to dinner far more than I used to.,Why aren't you living that cartoon millionaire's life? Kicking back, counting your money?,I think that has to do with the way I'm wired. I'm extremely competitive, and extremely paranoid in the things I'm competing in. The indulgence that I've taken is that I went to Scottsdale, Ariz., to play golf. What's really interesting about Silicon Valley, and Excite in particular, is that it's so hard driving, it has a tendency not to celebrate. And I think that celebration is a key part of making sure that you stay sane.,So you bought yourself the right to celebrate?,Yeah. Exactly.,Are there other things you buy now that you didn't used to buy?,Hardback books. Yeah. My mom bought me the last two suits I had. I hadn't bought suits since junior year of college, or something like that, so they were pretty worn out. Then I got my dry cleaning and laundry confused and took my dry cleaning to one of those wash-and-fold places, so it shrank and shriveled. So, I'd say the other sort of nice thing is that I actually bought myself a reasonable suit. But I never wear it.,What about buying things for other people? Is that your secret outlet? Because you're doing a bad job of spoiling yourself.,I do have more than one digital camera, so I gave one to a friend, and I think he has since given it to a friend, so it's sort of the communal digital camera. It's great. Or I bought a Mazda Miata that's just sort of the communal car at the company. My dad and I were able to buy my sister a car for Christmas, which was a nice treat.,What if you truly wanted something that cost, say, $100,000, or if a close friend did -- could you just drop that kind of cash without thinking it over?,I'd say that's well above the threshold of an easy amount of money to think about spending. That's still a huge amount of money. What it comes down to is, when your money's in stock, and that fluctuates on a daily basis, it's counting chickens before they're hatched. So much of what's on the books in the Valley rises and falls based on factors that you can't control. That leads to a mentality that says you don't spend money until you have it because it's not locked in.,What about A.T.M. habits? Do you take out more cash? That's a very sensitive indicator.,The major change in habit has been getting one of those [debit] cards. Somehow that's actually been the major difference, only because I'm able to use that card far more frequently than I could before. And it's not a credit card; it's cash.,I can remember my days of trying to find an A.T.M. that would give me a five-dollar bill.,Exactly. I can definitely remember that. I guess an easy statement is that I worry less about that situation occurring.

"A specter is stalking world politics, as Karl Marx might have manifested it -- the specter of the third way.,''The third way is part of the politics of the center and center left,'' said Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, last month. ''In Britain, it means New Labor.'' He defined his third way as a place where ''economic dynamism and social justice can live together.'',''European Governments spend and tax heavily,'' noted Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chairman of the Clinton Council of Economic Advisers, ''but the architects of the new Europe see them as a human third way between old-style socialism and the supposed divisive social consequences of the American way.'',Her former boss saw the way more benignly. In Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, he said, ''I thought we ought to have a third way,'' and in his 1998 State of the Union declared, ''We have found a third way.'' Last month, he told the Economic Club of Detroit: ''We are working with business to use technology, research and market incentives to meet national goals. Some have called this political philosophy 'the third way.''',Those ''some'' can also be found in Moscow. ''Former Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov accused Moscow Mayor and born-again centrist Yuri Luzhkov of 'economic illiteracy,''' wrote Harry Kopp of the Jamestown Foundation's Monitor. ''Luzhkov, who recently returned from Tony Blair's Britain, said Russia must choose 'a third way between total socialism and vulgar liberalism.''',Where there's a way, there's a will; in this case, Will Marshall, head of Washington's Progressive Policy Institute, who says that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton ''think a third way approach to governing is his legacy.'',Of course, left and right take their pops at it. Liberals see self-contradictions in such a ''slippery center.'' ''The Third Way assumes a basic political symmetry,'' wrote Jonathan Chait in The New Republic, ''an unreconstructed left, a radical right and a Third Way nestled in between.'' But this is self-defeating: ''When the Third Way takes power, it alters that equation [and] no longer sits between the two poles of the political spectrum; it is the left pole. The calculus has changed, and, in order to retain the center, the Third Way must shift right again.'',The Republican Lamar Alexander, of the Campaign for a New American Century (its onset is getting ever more likely), slams the way from the right. ''The third way is no way,'' he claims. ''Supposedly, this is an alternative to free-market capitalism, on the one hand, and socialism on the other. When you peel the layers off this particular onion, however, what you get is 'social democracy' -- the ever-expanding, cradle-to-grave welfare-state programs that hobble most European countries.'',Where did the latest moniker for the middle of the road come from? You can find the phrase in theology (between the second and fourth ways of St. Thomas Aquinas) and among the ways of phenomenology. In politics, the historian H.A.L. Fisher traced it to the French emperor Napoleon III, who steered between internal revolution and foreign war to choose a third way of liberalism. In the United States, early centrists working toward a third party between Federalists and Republicans were called Quiddists, from the Latin tertium quid, or ''third thing.'',Hotspur!,''He must find a way out among moderate Republicans and Democrats,'' the Times editorialist wrote of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, ''even if Republican hotspurs object.'',Every dictionary worth its spurs notes that the word hotspur was the sobriquet of Sir Henry Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland, killed in 1403 in the rebellion against Henry IV. (A sobriquet is a descriptive appellation, like Gov. Jesse [the Body] Ventura, which geezers will fondly recall followed, by two generations, Marie [the Body] McDonald.) The earliest citation of hotspur was in a chronicle a half-century later: ''Herry Percy the yonger, whom the Scottis clepid Herry Hatspore.'' Shakespeare then used the word in his ''Henry IV'': ''A haire-brained Hotspurre, gouern'd by a Spleene.'',Tangent time: those citations show us (1) that Henry led to Harry by way of Herry, or Herry was the progenitor of both, and (2) that the Shakespearean spelling of haire-brained is a source of the confusion about that word's meaning. It has nothing to do with hair found on the scalp on top of the skull that encases the brain. Rather, it is a hare, or rabbit, which was thought to have an especially small or weak brain. End of tangent.,But what is the metaphoric basis of hotspur? Why not coldspur or hotsaddle (as in the discomforting title of the Mel Brooks movie ''Blazing Saddles'')? When an equestrian rides impetuously or cruelly, spurring his horse constantly, the spurs are seen to become hot from the friction -- if not literally, at least figuratively. That's what harebrained Henry (not haire-brained Herry) did, and why they clepid, or yclept, or named him that. And that is also why profoundly literate editorialists still use hotspur to mean ''a rash, impetuous, hard-driving person.''",WILLIAM SAFIRE,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Way We Live Now: 2.28.99 -- On Language; New Paving for The Middle of the Road,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-2.28.99-on-language-new-paving-for-the-middle-of-the-road.html
"If a resident of Cambodia wakes up to find that, on top of all of the other daily struggles of life, his upper right bicuspid is throbbing, he has a few options. If he is lucky and wealthy, he may be able to find an accredited modern dentist. If he is like most Cambodians, however, he'll try a home remedy (like a pinch of salt or monosodium glutamate) and hope the pain goes away. And when it doesn't, he can always ask a faith healer to blow a burst of magic air into his mouth.,Among so many other things, dentists -- and thereby dental care -- were virtually eliminated by the Khmer Rouge during their four-year reign of terror. Today, children are taught by teachers without high-school degrees; courts answer to the whim of judges who didn't attend law school; and the sick often hang life-size straw effigies to ward off the spirits of disease. The country's only dental school has produced fewer than 70 graduates in the five years since it began issuing diplomas.,As a result, local practitioners like Sok Eng, 31 -- who lives in a village in Kandal Province, south of Phnom Penh -- qualify as experts. Ten of her 12 brothers and sisters are dentists, all trained by their father, who was, in turn, trained by his father.,Her rusting dental chair and pedal-run drill constitute the main furniture of her cement-floored, tin-roofed home. A peeling sign outside displays a menacing, disembodied set of teeth. The other day, three patients waited on plastic chairs, chatting with Sok Eng as she drilled away on a fourth patient. Sok Eng's small daughter examined her own teeth in a mirror. One patient had come to repair a broken tooth; one was receiving arsenic treatments to kill a nerve; one had come, in her own words, ''to pull some out and put some in.'' Local anesthetic is available, but only for emergencies.,A filling costs just $2.50. A crown is $10. For many rural Cambodians, though, even these prices are too steep. Remote villages are served by itinerant barbers who make the circuit of the rice fields on bicycles or motorbikes carrying a bag of all-purpose tools and cutting hair or pulling teeth as needed.,Others tolerate chronic discomfort as just one more of life's hardships. ''For the Khmer, it is no problem, a little pain,'' said Philippe Guibert, a French dental technician at the European Dental Clinic in the capital.

"New Jersey's water seems to be a fountain of trouble.,In Trenton last week, legislators introduced a measure to pay for filtering systems for two wells that serve Toms River. The $1.5 million project, promised by Governor Whitman, is intended to safeguard the water from chemicals that were found, once, in one of the wells, but are no longer present.,The chemicals -- trichloroethylene, a probable carcinogen, and styrene acrylonitrile trimer, whose effect on the human body is not known -- appeared in one of the wells after excessive removals drew in traces of a plume of residue from a Union Carbide Superfund site. The filters are to be built in addition to a Federal directive that Union Carbide insure that the local water company, United Water Toms River, not draw excessively from wells in the area.,Gerald Nicholls, director of environmental safety, health and analytical programs with the state Department of Environmental Protection, acknowledged that the filtration will be largely redundant. He said, however, ''Through intent or error, it will still be at least remotely possible to pull the plume into the wells.'',But some officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ''belt and suspenders'' approach had more to do with trying to assuage fears over the state's water supply than with demonstrated need.,Since 1979, cancer has been diagnosed in 102 children in and around Toms River, about 30 percent higher than would be expected for the area, Dover Township. Some suspicions fell on the water supply because the area's six wells are near two Superfund sites.,Sixty families there recently hired Jan Schlichtmann, the lawyer portrayed in the film ''A Civil Action,'' to represent them in negotiations with the companies involved in the Superfund sites, Union Carbide and Ciba-Geigy.,Mr. Schlichtmann was in attendance on Monday when Senator Frank R. Lautenberg announced he would introduce Federal legislation that will increase the scope of a program requiring water companies to send clients comprehensive water-quality reports, beginning this fall.,Toms River is not the only focus of concern. The state is testing eight other public water supplies around the state, for a total of more than 20 wells, for similar contamination, said Leslie McGeorge, the director of the department's Division of Science and Research.,And over the last year, reports from the state division of the United States Geological Survey, the state Department of Environmental Protection and Gloucester County have warned that some samples of water drawn from the state's shallowest aquifer, the Kirkwood-Cohansey, have shown levels of radium and mercury that exceed Federal standards for safety.,The aquifer serves much of south Jersey, and only municipal supplies are currently required to be tested. As many as 500,000 people use private wells that draw from the aquifer, and the state has repeatedly urged that owners have such wells tested.,Mercury, notoriously toxic in an organic compound known as methyl mercury, has been found in the aquifer in an inorganic form that is much less dangerous.,Last fall, the department ordered nine water suppliers, seven of which draw from the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer, to reduce radium levels, and testing continues throughout the state.,Last week, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that some environmentalists said the state's standards on radium were too lax. The state uses the Federal Environmental Protection standards of 5 picocuries per liter, a measurement that places a person's risk of cancer at 1 in 10,000 after 70 years of drinking two liters of water a day.,Dave Pringle, the campaign director for the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said the state should use the standard it applies to volatile organic contaminants, like benzene. That risk level is 1 in 1 million after the same exposure.,But Ms. McGeorge and Mr. Nicholls said no practical method existed for testing for radium at that level. And other scientists noted that vast treatment systems would create a new problem: concentrated radioactive waste.",ANDREA KANNAPELL,"FEB. 28, 1999",Water Worries Produce Legislation,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/water-worries-produce-legislation.html
"Every 20 seconds, someone in America is arrested for a drug violation. Every week, on average, a new jail or prison is built to lock up more people in the world's largest penal system.,It was not always so. Ten years ago, half as many people were arrested for drug crimes, and the nation's incarceration rate was closer to those of other democracies. But in the 1980's crack cocaine scared the country, and the criminal justice system has never been the same.,Crack poisoned many communities. Dealers turned neighborhoods into drug markets. As heavily armed gangs fought over turf, murder rates shot up. Authorities warned that crack was instantly addictive and spreading rapidly, and predicted that a generation of crack babies would bear the drug's imprint. It looked like a nightmare with no end.,But for all the havoc wreaked by crack, the worst fears were not realized. Crack appealed mainly to hard-core drug users. The number of crack users began falling not long after surveys began counting them. A decade later, the violence of the crack trade has burned out, and murder rates have plunged.,Yet crack left its mark, in ways that few people anticipated. Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws, lock up a record number of people and shift money from schools to prisons. It transformed police work, hospitals, parental rights, courts.,Crack also changed the racial makeup of American prisons. More whites than blacks use crack, according to surveys, but as the war on drugs focused on poor city neighborhoods, blacks went to prison at a far higher rate. Here in California, five black men are behind bars for each one in a state university.,But the harsh laws responding to crack have not reduced overall drug use. And now the ceaseless march of new drug offenders and the mounting costs of prisons are moving some of the people charged with enforcing the punitive laws to question the assumptions behind them.,''We have a failed social policy and it has to be re-evaluated,'' said Barry R. McCaffrey, the four-star general who heads the National Drug Control Policy Office. ''Otherwise, we're going to bankrupt ourselves. Because we can't incarcerate our way out of this problem.'',More than a quarter-million Americans in prison for drug offenses could be better dealt with in treatment programs, he said, saving up to $5 billion a year.,Since 1985 the nation's jail and prison population has grown 130 percent, and it will soon pass two million, even as crime rates continue a six-year decline. No country has more people behind bars, and only one, Russia, has a higher incarceration rate, according to the Sentencing Project, which tracks prison rates.,Behind the increase is a national get-tough mood that has produced longer sentences for all criminals and the end of parole in many states. Polls show that most Americans favor lengthy terms for violent criminals.,But perhaps the biggest single factor is the systematic jailing of drug offenders. In the first 10 years after Congress toughened drug laws in response to crack, the number of people imprisoned for drugs grew more than 400 percent, nearly twice the growth rate for violent criminals. More people are behind bars for drug offenses in the United States -- about 400,000 -- than are in prison for all crimes in England, France, Germany and Japan combined.,Crack's legacy can be seen in nearly every corner of the land, even here in the Mojave Desert, where the newest Federal prison is rising at the dusty edge of Victorville. In an age of Government downsizing, the Federal corrections budget has grown more than tenfold in a decade, to nearly $4 billion, yet prisons are so stuffed with drug offenders that this one will be at capacity almost from the day it opens.,Some experts argue what might seem obvious: that high incarceration rates deserve the credit for falling crime rates.,''Putting people in prison has been the single most important thing we've done to reduce crime,'' Dr. James Q. Wilson, the political scientist whose ideas have influenced police departments for a generation, has written.,In New York, the police and prosecutors say locking up thousands of drug offenders was a major factor in the city's turning the corner on crime. ''What plays havoc with a neighborhood are the low-level dealers,'' said Bridget Brennan, the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for New York. ''When they take over a street or a stoop, everyone else is terrified. When you put those people in jail, it gives the community a sense that order has been restored.'',What the prison boom has not done, however, is reduce illicit drug use, national surveys show. Many fewer Americans use illegal drugs now than in the peak years of the 1970's. But almost all of the drop occurred before crack cocaine or the laws passed in response to it.,The most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, for 1997, estimated that about 14 million people had used an illegal drug in the last month, a number barely changed since 1988. Of those, 600,000 had smoked crack within a month, unchanged since 1988. But during that time, imprisonment rates soared.,''What's happened across the board is that police started going after small-time street dealers and users,'' said Dr. Steven Belenko, a criminologist at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.,Crack never became a mainstream drug, but the fear of it changed perception and laws for virtually all illicit drugs, according to Mr. Belenko and others who have studied the war on drugs.,''Crack probably had more impact on the entire criminal justice system than it had on the communities and the drug users,'' said Dr. Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California School of Law. ''This secondary impact, on police and prisons, may end up being more negative than anything associated with the drug.'',Among governors, teachers, criminologists and police chiefs, there is vigorous debate over how the drug laws enacted at the height of the crack panic have transformed the nation. But in Congress, which enacted the laws without a single hearing, there is nothing. For crack has left one other major legacy: The policy discussion in Washington on prisons and drugs has been frozen for more than a decade.,The Evidence,As Crime Rate Falls, More Prisons Are Built,The little towns tucked into the folds of the Appalachian Mountains in Schuylkill County, Pa., are a world removed from the city streets where crack cocaine was a media obsession in the mid-1980's. But the legacy of crack is all around.,A first-year teacher there can expect to make $18,500 a year, the state-mandated minimum. A prison guard trainee is paid $22,300. The job of watching over the drug offenders and others who are filling three new state prisons in the region is coveted.,Pennsylvania might not seem the kind of place where prisons and jails would be booming. The state has an aging population. Crime has never been a particularly big problem; among the states, Pennsylvania has ranked near the bottom. But every year for the last 14 years, Pennsylvania has added at least one prison, and the corrections budget has soared to more than $1 billion a year, a fivefold increase over a decade.,In 1988, not long before President George Bush spoke to the nation about the war on drugs while holding up a bag of crack, Pennsylvania radically changed its drug laws, establishing mandatory minimum sentences for people caught with illicit drugs. No time off for first-time offenders. No community service. No treatment for addicts.,Pennsylvania was following the lead of Congress, which had set the nation on a course of strict incarceration for drug users with laws enacted in 1986 and 1988. Ten years later, its inmate population had grown 225 percent, to 35,600. Pennsylvania spends an average of $20,000 a year for each one, about the national average.,Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, has no plans to change the incarceration policy. ''Every public expenditure comes with a choice,'' said his spokesman, Tim Reeves. ''We defend the choices we've made.'',The crime rate might not be so low if the state had not locked up so many drug offenders, Mr. Reeves said. ''What would the rate be if those guys were not in jail?'' he said. ''Think about the cost to the community, the wasted lives and violent crime.'',But in building a penal system in which 3 of every 10 new prisoners are serving time for drugs, according to the Pennsylvania Sentencing Commission, which tracks prison rates for the state, Pennsylvania, like most states, has not reduced illegal drug use.,''I don't think anybody believes it has turned out to be an effective policy,'' said David Sweet, a Harrisburg lawyer who headed a special commission that examined the state's prison growth. ''It appeared to us that we were using a very expensive way to provide secure housing for people who probably don't belong in prison.'',Dr. Julia Glover Hall, a criminologist at Drexel University and president of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, which Benjamin Franklin established to monitor prisons and jails, said: ''It's a stupid game we're playing. We're locking up all these nonviolent offenders, pouring money down a rat hole.'',She added: ''I've been a crime victim. I'm not soft on criminals. But we have to look at the bottom line of what we're doing. There was this powerful scare in the crack years, and all across the country we passed these Draconian laws. Now we're starting to see how much it has cost the rest of us.'',Pennsylvania is typical of what has happened across the country. California is spending nearly $4 billion a year to operate the nation's largest prison system. As the state added 21 prisons since 1984 -- and only one university campus -- violent criminals fell to 42 percent of the prison population in 1997, from 57 percent, while drug inmates grew to 27 percent, from 8 percent.,Political leaders have debated whether the building boom was at the expense of their budget's other big discretionary item, higher education. Many politicians said the state would try to fully finance both. But the numbers tell another story.,Spending on prisons has grown 60 percent over a decade, and pay for prison guards has more than doubled. For higher education, there was virtually no growth, and salaries in the state university system stagnated, falling behind other states. A prison guard now makes about $51,000 a year, while a first-year professor in California's once-vaunted university system is paid $41,000.,As the prison budget swelled, California raised tuition to make up the university financing gap. Over the last 10 years, as the state's population grew by 5 million people, state university enrollment fell 20,000.,The shift in priorities, documented in a number of studies, has become a major issue since a new Governor, Gray Davis, and a new Legislature took office.,''Most of our buildings are literally falling apart and we've lost 1,500 full-time faculty members,'' said Jeri Bledsoe, general manager of the California Faculty Association. ''You bet there's been a price to pay for our prison boom.'',The Convicted,$40 Worth of Cocaine Brings a Life Sentence,The biggest legacy of crack is out of sight, behind the concrete and steel of prisons. Addicts, couriers, girlfriends of dealers, people tempted by the lure of a quick buck, mostly poor blacks -- these are the dominant profiles of the people jailed since prisons started filling with drug criminals.,Inside the maximum-security unit at the state prison for women in Topeka, Kan., Gloria L. Van Winkle is in the sixth year of a life term for possessing $40 worth of cocaine. A mother of two and a drug addict, she had two convictions for cocaine possession when a convicted thief told undercover agents she was smoking crack and they set up a sting.,Kansas has all but forgotten about Ms. Van Winkle. Asked about her case, the state Sentencing Commission said no one was doing life for drug possession. ''Only murderers get life sentences in Kansas,'' said its executive director, Barbara Tombs.,On further review, Ms. Tombs found that, yes, for a brief period in the early 90's, a person convicted of three drug offenses could get life. That law was changed. Ms. Van Winkle's sentence was not.,''I can't laugh anymore, I can't cry -- it's just a slow rage that makes me numb,'' Ms. Van Winkle said. Her sentence offers an eventual chance of parole, but for now, she lives for visits from her children, ages 10 and 6, and wonders what they will grow up to be like with her behind bars.,Her concern is shared by many others: Three-fourths of the 54,000 women jailed for drug crimes have children.,The police and prosecutors said Ms. Van Winkle should have been aware of the possibility of a life sentence. They said she was chosen because they thought she might lead them to dealers, but no follow-up arrests were made.,Ms. Van Winkle's case is rare but not unique. Because of three-strikes laws and other changes made in the last decade, people in at least six other states are serving life sentences for drug possession. More typical among women convicted of drug offenses are 5- and 10-year mandatory terms.,Tonya Drake, a mother of four, had no criminal record or history of drug use when she was sentenced to 10 years in Federal prison for mailing a package that contained crack cocaine. She says a friend paid her $44 to mail the package, which she did not know contained drugs.,Ms. Drake admits what she did was wrong. ''But the time does not fit the crime,'' she said in a prison interview. ''You lock me up for 10 years. While I'm here, my father dies, my children grow up, it cost thousands of dollars to keep me behind bars.'',The children are having considerable trouble growing up with their mother in prison, said Ms. Drake's sister, Williet Mitchell. ''Tonya was taken away from the kids at a time when everybody needed her,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''Now the kids are screwed up. They're angry and bitter that she was forced to leave them.'',When the children see their mother in the prison visiting room, Ms. Drake tries to explain what brought her there. ''I tell my kids I did something wrong, that it was a mistake,'' she said. ''But it was my first and only mistake.'',In Kentucky, Louie Cordell, a 55-year-old father of nine with no prior convictions, is finishing a mandatory five-year Federal sentence for growing 141 marijuana plants.,Mr. Cordell was sent to prison under the 1986 law that set mandatory 5- and 10-year sentences for the possession or sale of small amounts of crack. For marijuana, the law set a mandatory sentence of 5 years for possession of 100 plants, whether they were seedlings or 6 feet tall. That provision has since been changed to go by weight.,The law punished Mr. Cordell, but it hit his family just as hard. He worked seasonally at a sawmill in a poor county in southeastern Kentucky and was growing the marijuana to help make ends meet, said his wife, Shirley.,Since Mr. Cordell went to prison, a son gave up plans to attend college on a scholarship in order to help support the family, and the Cordells have been on and off welfare.,''There's no way to describe what's happened to us except to say that it's been bad in all ways,'' Mrs. Cordell said. ''Louie was here providing for us and then they took him away. I expected him to get some time for what he did, but not five years.'',Marijuana was never mentioned in the floor speeches in Congress when the drug laws were rewritten in 1986, but the new penalties for crack were accompanied by harsher sentences for most drugs. Ten years later, more people were sentenced under the Federal system for marijuana than for any other drug.,Supporters of harsh penalties argue that locking up the Louie Cordells of the world has a deterrent effect and say convictions reduce other crimes associated with drug use.,Marijuana arrests set a record in 1997 -- 695,200, nearly 90 percent of which were for simple possession. And marijuana remains, by far, the most popular illegal drug: 18 million Americans used marijuana at least once in 1997, according to the National Household Survey. And some 71 million, 33 percent of those over age 12, have used marijuana at some time.,Asked about deterrence, the Federal prosecutor in Mr. Cordell's case, David Marye, said marijuana cultivation does not seem to have diminished in rural Kentucky.,''I've been prosecuting cases, state and Federal, for 21 years, and we have so many people who keep doing what Louie Cordell was doing that it makes you wonder if we'll ever stop them,'' he said.,The Cities,Racial Implications Of the Crack Laws,One of every 20 Americans born this year will serve time in prison, according to a Justice Department study. For blacks, the projection is 1 in 4. By 1996, 8.3 percent of black men age 25 to 29 were inmates, compared with 0.8 percent of white men that age.,The odds of going to prison used to be more even. But the criminal justice system's special treatment of crack cocaine dramatically threw off the balance, according to reports by the Sentencing Commission and the Justice Department.,For people convicted of a crack offense, the world of justice is unlike any other. Crack is simply cocaine processed so that it can be smoked. But Federal law equates 5 grams of crack with 500 grams of powder cocaine, a 1-to-100 ratio that no other country recognizes. Possessing 5 grams of crack is a felony with an automatic five-year prison term, while 5 grams of the same drug in powder form is a misdemeanor likely to carry no jail time.,One consequence of the disparity is that kingpins at the top of a drug network who sell pounds of powder cocaine for processing often serve less time than street-level dealers who sell grams of crack.,''One of the great victims of the drug war is that our sense of penal proportion has been thrown out,'' said Professor Zimring, of the University of California School of Law. ''Now we have a fairness problem.'',In addition, a law aimed at one type of drug use has been applied most often against one type of user -- urban blacks.,A higher percentage of blacks use crack cocaine than whites or Hispanic people. But in absolute numbers, twice as many whites as blacks use crack, and three times as many whites as blacks use powder cocaine, the national household survey shows.,As the war on drugs set up special penalties on crack, however, law enforcement focused on the highly visible, often violent crack trade in city neighborhoods, rather than the larger traffic in cocaine going on behind closed doors across the country. The result: Nearly 90 percent of the people locked up for crack under Federal drug laws are black, General McCaffrey said.,In state prisons, blacks make up nearly 60 percent of the people serving time on drug offenses, according to Justice Department figures, though they are only 12 percent of the general population and 15 percent of regular drug users.,''I don't think we got into this fix because of racism,'' General McCaffrey said. ''The impact of crack on the African-American community was devastating. And that's where enforcement has been concentrated.'',The racial disparity would disappear if the law treated the powder and crack form of cocaine equally, said Dr. Douglas C. McDonald, a senior scientist at Abt Associates, a social policy research group in Cambridge, Mass., who testified before Congress. If enforcement were evenly applied, more whites than blacks would go to prison, he said.,So, for many blacks the legacy of crack is not just the violence and high prison rates that have hit so many communities, but a heightened sense that the law does not treat them fairly.,''You have so many people who feel hopeless, who feel that it is extremely unfair that so many low-level offenders are going to jail for such a long time,'' said Mattie Compton, a black community leader in Fort Worth, Tex., who is deputy chief assistant United States attorney for the civil division.,''We know we're going to lose people in poor neighborhoods, but when you see people who are prospects for future leaders going away to jail for so long, you wonder if we really are a community under siege,'' Ms. Compton said.,Asked about the legacy of crack in the Roxbury district of Boston, where he works with drug addicts at a community health center, Seward Hunter said: ''If you're African-American, you expect to be targeted by the police and you expect to be stopped and searched.'',Many in Congress say there is no racial intent behind the crack and powder disparity. Crack is punished more severely because of its harm and because of the violent crimes associated with it.,''No one should forget that crack traffickers deal in death, and that they do so to the most vulnerable among us, the residents of our inner cities,'' said Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime.,The Change,Crack Makes News; Congress Responds,How Congress came to write a law that allows a person caught with 400 grams of powder cocaine, worth some $40,000, to do less than a year in jail, while a person holding the same amount of cocaine in crack form will spend 10 years in prison, is a mystery to people who have tried to research the statutory intent.,One lawyer who was instrumental in rewriting the drug laws in 1986 and 1988 says it came about through whim and attempts by politicians to one-up each other as crack seized headlines just before elections.,''There was a level of hysteria that led to a total breakdown of the legislative process,'' said the lawyer, Eric Sterling, who as a lead lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee wrote the laws that established long mandatory terms for several drugs. Since leaving the Judiciary Committee in 1989, Mr. Sterling has worked to overturn the laws as president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in Washington.,In the summer of 1986, crack was just starting to be labeled as an epidemic when a college basketball star, Len Bias, died of a drug overdose, reportedly crack cocaine. Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., whose hometown team, the Boston Celtics, had drafted Mr. Bias, ordered an overhaul of Federal drug laws. The death of Mr. Bias was invoked in Congress 11 times.,The law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, passed the House with only 16 dissenting votes. Despite complaints by some Senators that no one had studied the bill, it sailed through the Senate and President Ronald Reagan signed it before Election Day.,A year later, court testimony revealed that Mr. Bias died of an overdose of powder cocaine, not crack. But by then crack had its special status in state and Federal law.,Crack was singled out for good reason, according to Edwin Meese 3d, the Attorney General in the mid-1980's and now the Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow of Public Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington.,''Crack cocaine was the scourge of the inner city,'' he said. ''The reason laws were changed was to protect the inner city.'',In 1988, Congress passed another overhaul of drug laws just before the election, singling out crack as the only drug to carry a mandatory five-year prison term for possession.,That year, a Gallup poll found that 62 percent of Americans surveyed agreed that to curb drug use they ''would be willing to give up some freedoms.'',Crack was on the cover of news magazines, dominated television and newspaper coverage, and was labeled ''America's drug of choice,'' by NBC. The New York Times reported that it was spreading to the suburbs. William J. Bennett, the drug czar for 18 months under President Bush, said it might soon invade every home in America. Crack was compared to the bubonic plague and called ''the most addictive drug known to man'' in Newsweek.,Today, few of the revisionist experts on drug laws dispute crack's link to violence and gangs. ''It was a nightmare,'' General McCaffrey said. ''It was World War III.'',But crack was never America's drug of choice -- it did not come close. At the height of concern in the late 1980's, the National Household Survey on Drugs estimated that less than one-half of 1 percent of the population over age 12 used crack once a month, while 10 percent used marijuana. And 3 out of 4 high school seniors who tried crack did not continue to use it, according to a national survey of students by the University of Michigan.,Both surveys have flaws, underestimating inner-city users and high school dropouts. But, even after adjusting the findings for high use in certain urban areas, crack was never the epidemic it was held up to be.,The media attention was so hyperbolic that the Drug Enforcement Administration was compelled to correct the record. ''Crack is currently the subject of considerable media attention,'' the agency said in 1986. ''The result has been a distortion of the public perception of the extent of crack use as compared to the use of other drugs.'',Although crack was labeled the world's most addictive drug, 10 years of national surveys have shown that most people who try crack do not continue to use it.,Because of its intense but short-lived effect, crack does tend to make its users ''psychologically dependent,'' reported a Justice Department study. But numerous studies have shown that crack, like the powder form of cocaine, may be less physically addictive than alcohol or tobacco.,The Pyramid,Lower Level Dealers Feel the Sting of Laws,Political leaders said harsh sentencing laws were intended to deter use of the most dangerous drugs, with crack at the top of the list. Failing that, they said, the laws would at least go after drug kingpins. But statistics show a different pattern among people sentenced to prison for drugs since 1986.,Of the people jailed for crack by the Federal Government, only 5 percent were considered high-level dealers, according to a study by the Sentencing Commission.,''The current policy focuses law-enforcement efforts on the lowest level of the distribution line, the street level dealer,'' the commission's vice chairman, Michael S. Gelacak, wrote. ''Unless we ignore all evidence to the contrary, the current policy has little or no impact upon the drug abuse problem. The jails are full.'',Supporters of the crack laws say the numbers are explained by the pyramid structure of drug operations; by nature they have few people at the top, lots of people at the bottom.,But those at the top are often dealing powder cocaine, with its vastly different penalties. And they are in a position to become informers, the only real hope of beating a mandatory prison term.,Had Tonya Drake, the woman serving 10 years for mailing a package, been able to supply what the law labels ''substantial assistance'' -- information on a high-level dealer -- she might have reduced her sentence. The 1980's drug laws leave discretion in the hands of prosecutors to encourage people to ''snitch.'',Ms. Drake identified the man who gave her the package, but he was never found. The prosecutor decided her assistance was not substantial. The fixed sentences have infuriated judges, who say they feel their role has been reduced to that of rubber stamps for prosecutors, while their courts are clogged with low- to medium-level drug offenders.,''When you're dealing with first-time offenders, you should have some discretion,'' said Lawrence Irving, a former Federal judge from San Diego. ''I had cases where I was forced to give more jail time for low-level offenders than for the kingpins. It made no sense.'',In a 1994 case in Chicago, Marvin E. Aspen, a Federal District Court judge, labeled his sentencings ''a farce'' as he sent the lowest and ''least culpable'' member of a big crack operation to prison for longer than a supplier at the top.,Monica Boguille, the 20-year-old mother of a baby girl, was sentenced to 10 years for occasionally counting money for her boyfriend, a crack dealer. L. C. Godfrey, one of the ring's wholesale suppliers of cocaine, who was deemed helpful to prosecutors, received 9 years.,Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court said recently that Federal judges should regain some of the discretion they once had. Five years ago, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made similar points in condemning the mandatory minimum sentences established by Congress.,Dozens of Federal judges, most of them former prosecutors, have taken a strong stand against mandatory minimum drug sentences. For these judges, the most significant legacy of crack is a legal system that has left them as little more than spectators in their own courtrooms.,The Aftermath,The Penalties Outlive Fear of an Epidemic,General McCaffrey says he came to the drug debate with an open mind but has become convinced that current policies, with the primary emphasis on imprisonment, are failing. ''The current system is bad drug policy and bad law enforcement,'' he said.,On cost alone, arresting, prosecuting and locking up all drug criminals at the price of about $35 billion a year is not effective, he said. He now favors long sentences for dealers and treatment for low-level users.,A recent study by the Rand Corporation concluded that mandatory jail terms are the least cost-effective way of reducing cocaine consumption. For violent crimes, long sentences keep criminals off the street, it reported, but for drug crimes, ''a jailed supplier is often replaced by another supplier.'',Drug treatment also has a low success rate; among regular users of cocaine who undergo treatment, only 1 in 8 stop. But even that would achieve a greater reduction in cocaine use, at a fraction of the cost, than prison, the Rand study stated.,''We misread a lot what was going on in the 1980's, in that we thought crack use was going to grow and take over society,'' said Dr. Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who conducted the study. ''The real tragedy is that, now that it's clear that crack was not the epidemic it was supposed to be, we still have these laws.'',But few authorities on crime expect the laws to change, no matter how full the prisons become. ''For politicians, the drug debate is driven by the three R's -- retribution, revenge, retaliation -- and that leads to the fourth R, re-election,'' said Dr. James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University.,This month, the Clinton Administration announced a plan to cut drug use in half by 2007. After years of reduced Federal financing for drug rehabilitation, it would increase money for treating addicts.,The war metaphor has been dropped by the White House, and by some in Congress as well. But the emphasis on long mandatory prison terms and locking up small-time dealers remains the main strategy for Congress.,''I believe it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the war on drugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all Americans, and our children in particular, that the sale of illegal drugs is dangerous, wrong and will not be tolerated,'' said Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.,Senator Abraham has introduced a bill that would establish much longer sentences for people convicted of powder cocaine offenses, making them closer to crack.,''All that bill would do is lock up a bigger batch of small fry,'' said Julie Stewart, a former member of the conservative Cato Institute, who founded Families Against Mandatory Minimums after her brother was sent to prison on a marijuana conviction. The group has 37,000 members.,But with polls showing that most Americans favor long prison terms for drug trafficking, attempts to persuade Congress to reconsider the laws have gone nowhere. Sentiment has remained the same for nearly a decade, dating to a time when some politicians predicted that America could be drug-free by the year 2000. Nobody makes such a prediction these days.,NEXT: The police arm themselves for the war on drugs.",TIMOTHY EGAN,"FEB. 28, 1999","War on Crack Retreats, Still Taking Prisoners",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/war-on-crack-retreats-still-taking-prisoners.html

"WHEN people describe James Waring Koven, the word colossal comes up over and over. A member of the United States men's national rowing team and the 1997 world champion in men's single sculls, he has colossal lungs, friends say, and always eats colossal meals. He travels with a gigantic duffel bag, which his teammates call the Blob. It holds everything from sweat pants to novels to Powerbars.,''The Blob grows to sizes beyond compare,'' said Fred Honebein, a fellow rower. ''You don't look into the Blob. It's like looking into the sun. You'll go blind.'',Sam Caspersen, a childhood friend, added that Mr. Koven has always had a colossal build. ''In eighth grade he was six feet, 175 pounds, extremely strong.'',Mr. Koven, now 25, lives in Cambridge, Mass., and is training for next year's Olympics. He trains every morning, goes to work as a corporate finance analyst at the State Street Capital Corporation in Boston and then returns to practice again. Like many rowers, he's a perfectionist with a high threshold for pain. Friends says he's also a sentimentalist who cries openly when he's moved.,Five years ago he met Sophia Emily Coquillette at a party given by mutual friends. ''My heart was just racing,'' Mr. Koven remembered. ''I couldn't even think straight. It was a very powerful encounter.'',Ms. Coquillette, 24, is a project analyst at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, a Boston law firm. Like Mr. Koven, she is known for being both emotional and hard-working. ''I remember her with glasses on her face, books on the table and a cup of tea,'' said Brook Gomez, who shared a dormitory room with Ms. Coquillette at Brown University. ''She's very disciplined. There's nothing that will alter her everyday regimen.'',Mr. Koven and Ms. Coquillette, who are known as Jamie and Sophie by most people, didn't start dating until three years after they met, when he traveled to Boston for the Head of the Charles Regatta and called her. Very soon, it was clear they were madly in love.,''They had their first date in October 1997, and six days later was the regatta,'' Mr. Caspersen said. ''As Jamie got into the boat, he gave me a quick wave and said to Sophia, 'One more kiss before the race,' in this teddy bear voice. I thought to myself, 'Game over.' '',Mr. Koven proposed last summer while they were canoeing in upstate New York, surrounded by lily pads, butterflies and dragonflies. ''It was spontaneous and natural,'' Ms. Coquillette said. ''He didn't have the ring, which was really nice. He didn't dot all the i's and cross the t's.'',Like the couple, their Feb. 20 wedding was unfrivolous, yet full of sentiment. It took place at the Friends Meeting at Cambridge, a tranquil place with wooden benches and bare walls painted the color of coffee ice cream. Even the programs were austere, printed on limestone-colored paper in a typeface reminiscent of an old manual typewriter.,As a fire crackled in a stone hearth and a lutenist played Renaissance melodies, the bride arrived in a simple sleeveless dress with a boat neck. Following Quaker tradition, the ceremony had a long period of silence. ''There wasn't much to focus on but Jamie and Sophie holding hands and sharing whispers,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''It was extremely emotional and exposing.'',After the silence, the Rev. Janet Cooper-Nelson, the university chaplain at Brown, read ''thanksgivings'' from the couple. Ms. Coquillette gave thanks for ''Jamie's wholehearted and unabashed enthusiasm for life, including dancing, rowing, snowboarding, being with friends.'' She also gave thanks that he was amused by her ''need for coffee, love of public transport and exuberant hand gesturing.'' Mr. Koven gave thanks for ''long walks, the dancing, the competitive Scrabble games'' and the ''lily pads, flowers, butterflies and dragonflies'' that will always remind him of the day they got engaged and their wedding day.",LOIS SMITH BRADY,"FEB. 28, 1999",VOWS; Sophie Coquillette and Jamie Koven,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/style/vows-sophie-coquillette-and-jamie-koven.html

"THERE was a moment that was so moving it actually sent shivers into the scalp at the Chinese New Year celebration last weekend at the County Center here. Ke-Zaheng Wen, a 70-year-old internationally known bass-baritone originally from China, was singing ''Ol' Man River.'' The power of his voice was wonderful, but most stunning were his inflections and phrasing, the way he sang the words, in Chinese-accented English, as if they had been written for him:,''I get weary and sick of trying, I'm tired of living and scared of dying, but Ol' Man River, he just keeps rolling along.'',This quintessentially American song, he said after the performance, moves him from the heart. Although in Jerome Kern's ''Show Boat,'' it is sung by a poor 19th-century black man, Mr. Wen said he found in it something pertinent to his life. ''In China, when the Cultural Revolution came, it was not the workers who were oppressed and persecuted, it was the artists and intellectuals,'' he said through an interpreter. ''For many of us, it was a nightmare.'' The river, he added, could have been the Yangtze as well as the Mississippi; the fatalistic sorrow, his own at the time of China's upheaval. In English, he said, ''This song, I have very much deep feeling for.'',In similar but less dramatic ways, the blend of Chinese and American and Eastern and Western cultures was evident throughout the evening. Sponsored by the local branch of the National Organization of Chinese Americans, which focuses on immigration and other legal issues, and the Westchester Chinese Association, a nonprofit cultural group, it was a festivity heralding the arrival of the Year of the Rabbit. Virtually everyone there had been born either in China or Taiwan or had parents who had been. There were plenty of traditional Chinese dances and songs; almost all of the 600 people attending wore at least some red, the traditional color of good luck.,But there were many American influences as well. Teen-agers who on stage wore silk robes and pajamas of fuchsia and lime appeared afterward in blue jeans and leather jackets. Not everyone munched red bean cakes or dumplings, the traditional New Year's foods, but pizza and fries from the concession stand. And the night ended with adults and children doing the macarena to music played by a disk jockey.,''It's really good to feel both Chinese and American,'' said Petula Shyu, a 16-year-old student at Scarsdale High School and, on Saturdays, at the Chinese School of Southern Westchester in Edgemont, where she learns Mandarin Chinese. ''I was born here. I am an American, but I'm also Chinese. With my family, a big part of that is respecting your ancestors. On the actual New Year -- this year, it was Tuesday, Feb. 16 -- we go to see my maternal grandmother in Brooklyn. She is 88. Then we go visit other relatives and friends, in the traditional way.'',Smiling and nodding approval were Betty Hsieh, who works at International Business Machines, and her husband, Wen Hsieh, who owns a consulting company. The Hsiehs, who live in Scarsdale, have children in college and high school. ''I grew up in Taiwan,'' Mr. Hsieh said. ''Chinese culture stresses family values, a lot of respect for the family. This is good. In America, everything is so individualistic. But that too is good. Nowhere else is society so open, so full of opportunity. The best thing is to combine the best of both worlds.'',Petula was among the teen-agers who performed on the stage of the little theater. She and Vivian Yee, also a 16-year-old from Scarsdale, were part of a folk dance called ''Embroidered Purse.'' As the girls executed graceful movements, Rose Kaung, a mathematics professor at Westchester Community College, whispered to an audience member, ''This is the story of a young woman whose love is far away, who embroiders a silk purse for him.'' Suddenly a tiny brocade pouch struck someone lightly on the shoulder. ''Oh! that is good luck,'' Mrs. Kaung said. ''The dancers throw those into the audience and whoever gets one is supposed to prosper in the new year.'',Folk music is also performed by Hsing Lih Chou. Mr. Chou, an entertainer clad in black slacks and a collarless jacket -- ''the students' 'uniform' in China,'' he said -- played guitar and sang Taiwanese songs. Born 48 years ago in Taiwan and now living in Manhattan, he teaches Asian-American studies in Manhattan and is principal of the Chinese School of Southern Westchester. Like its counterparts, the Chinese School of Northern Westchester in Somers and the Huaxia Chinese School in Hartsdale, it holds classes on weekends for elementary, middle and high school-age youngsters in Chinese language and culture.,''I like to put emotion into what I do,'' Mr. Chou said, after his spirited performance. ''One of these folk songs sounds like something by American Indians, don't you think? The same kind of sad, wailing, chanting sound. In school when I teach, I try to make the students feel things. You cannot just tell them things, you need to relate them to what they know. I don't focus on, say, the word for lo mein; instead, I will teach them how to say spaghetti in Chinese.,''When I first came to America, Oct. 29. 1976, I experienced culture shock. I flew into J.F.K. A friend picks me up and we go through Queens and across the Queensboro Bridge. I see a subway car. I see all this ugly, dirty graffiti. I said to my friend, what is this, the train that goes to the garbage dump? He said, get used to it. That's the train you'll be traveling on every day. Not only did I get used to it, now I love it.'',For some, the transition was not so easy. Generally, people of Chinese descent living in Taiwan who came to America did so completely voluntarily, for a chance at a better career or education. For some from the mainland, however, the situation was more complicated. Mingjian Gao, a 40-year-old United Nations translator now living in Scarsdale, left Beijing when he was 28. His mother, who was visiting Scarsdale for the New Year, still lives there.,''She likes to stay among her friends and what is familiar,'' he said. No permission was needed for Mr. Gao to leave -- ''By then everything was reformed,'' he said -- but he does have memories of the Red Guard ransacking his house when he was a child. ''My father was a math teacher,'' he said simply as an explanation. ''It only happened once.'',Like so many others, his life is now a mix of Chinese and American customs. For the New Year, he ate dumplings, considered in northern China to be a lucky New Year food. He did not, however, get to see the glowing displays of fireworks as he once did in China. ''That we could not provide,'' Brenda Sun, a real estate broker from Scarsdale who is one of the festival's organizers, said with a laugh. Mr. Gao added: ''Even in New York City, this year, they could not have fireworks in Chinatown. People missed them. I understand they used fake ones, little paper explosions, which was all the Mayor would allow. That's too bad. It was part of a Happy New Year celebration.''",LYNNE AMES,"FEB. 28, 1999",The View From/White Plains; Recalling Yangtze River In Song for the New Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/the-view-from-white-plains-recalling-yangtze-river-in-song-for-the-new-year.html
"PEOPLE at the Hartford Public Library are borrowing more books than ever, says Louise Blalock, the chief librarian and moving force behind the library's $36 million expansion and renovation.,But those customers may have to wait a bit longer for the project to start. The city approved $16 million in bond funds for the expansion in 1996 and after a required study and planning phase, $13 million remained when the project was put up for bids in December. The lowest of the three bids, however, was $3 million over budget and city officials are considering an extension for bids. Still, supporters of the expansion remain eager to resolve the gap and get on with the job, which was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Fletcher, Harkness, Cohen, Moneyhun, in association with Sevigny/Architects of Hartford. ''My top priority right now,'' Ms. Blalock said, ''is keeping this job moving forward.'',It isn't just that the library, which opened in 1957 and is now inadequately wired, cannot accommodate the largest inventory in the state, she said. The way it is used needs to be refocused.,She foresees a computer-enhanced, multi-disciplinary structure that, in addition to providing books and information in the most up-to-date way, will support growing efforts to reach children and families, neighborhoods and schools. ''It makes a statement about the city's commitment to information, learning and the library as a cultural center for the community,'' she said.,The expansion is to begin with a new atrium in the rear of the existing structure, opening to a three-level extension filled with books, art and audio-visual materials. This so-called glass bridge will, in turn, connect to the project's primary addition, which will house parking, meeting space with telecommunications equipment, a community television station and children's library.,When the expansion is completed, in June, 2000, if all goes well, the existing building will be renovated with new electrical, heating, ventilation and security systems, air-conditioning and windows. In all, the expansion will add 23,000 square feet, bringing the enlarged library to 54,000 square feet.,While trying to start the initial phase of the expansion, the library still needs funds to complete that phase and is conducting a capital campaign for $5 million from corporations, foundations and individuals. It will then look to a second referendum in 2000, for $15 million in bonding and a possible $500,000 in state construction money, for renovation.,Features of the renovations will include 100 computers for public use, a lab for Hartford and regional library staffs, an improved reading room and room for what is called the Hartford Collection, dedicated to the preservation and research of city documents, plus space for working writers, and a gallery for the work of state artists. ''Downtown residents can have a cappuccino,'' Ms. Blalock said, ''use a PC, read and buy books, enjoy themselves in the evening.'',The president of the library board, William M. Large, summed up the library's role in downtown Hartford. ''We have become de facto baby-sitters, homework helpers, a bright light for kids.'',Hyacinth Yennie, president of the neighborhood group Hartford Areas Rally Together, said the organization resoundingly supports the plans. ''This new library is going to be more technology-connected to schools, and that's a very exciting project.'',Ms. Blalock also wants local artists to play an enlarged role in the library's daily operation. With staff members already circulating flyers at area arts organizations, explaining how the library can further patrons' experiences, she said she was looking for new ideas on how best to use local talent.,Tim Cole, a Hartford photographer and picture framer, suggested adding secured display space and conferences and educational programs. But he said the library could do better at finding working artists not necessarily connected to established art centers. ''A whole lot of the artistic energy in the community is generated by working artists not institutionalized,'' he said.,Various foundations and corporations have offered support to improve library services, such as the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving award of $150,000 to the a family literacy program and $900,000 for extended hours and programs for new immigrants. MCI Worldcom has contributed $30,000 to help the library introduce the Internet to small businesses.,To help the city and library set a tone of openness to all this change, architects designed a curved glass wall fronting the renovated original building. ''When you're walking on Main Street,'' said Michael Cohen of the architectural firm, ''you can see what's going on in the library, see that it's active.'',He added that, with the adjacent City Hall and the Wadsworth Atheneum set farther back from the street, a new walkway will pull in pedestrians and link the three buildings. ''To be in a place that's green,'' he said, ''and end up in the courtyard of the library.'',While supporting a library with expanded  downtown services that will also reach the region, some area librarians were cautious. Denis M. Lorenz, director of library services in West Hartford, was concerned that, with so much information available on line, patrons will be less likely to seek information in Hartford. Peter Ciparelli, director of the Rockville Public Library, voiced frustration over complications some area libraries have in connecting with Hartford's automated network.,Unlike the city of Hartford's limited participation in other city construction projects like Riverfront Recapture, with multiple sources of funding, the city is running the library expansion with unusual cooperation among those involved.,Ms. Blalock said that Mayor Michael Peters, the city manager, Saundra Kee Borges, and city council members have all worked together. ''They recognize we all want a great city, and know we need a great library to have a great city,'' she said.,Steven D. Park, a city councilman, said the path in front of the library will be part of a larger city walkway, informally called ''Main Street U.S.A.'' It will eventually link the city's notable buildings, from The Old State House to The Bushnell Auditorium, he said. ''It will be a cultural walkway.'',Ms. Blalock said she believed the project would set the tone for other growth in the city, comparing her venture to similar library expansion projects in Denver, St. Louis and Cleveland. ''Wherever this has happened,'' she said, ''it has been a key to urban renewal.'',So, with fingers crossed, she said she hoped for a resolution to the budget issues and a return to setting priorities for a 21st century library. ''It is a place that brings communities together -- and honors the book,'' she said.",STEPHEN L.

"WHEN I was around 16, freshly emerged from a bout of adolescence complete with pimples, braces and a sullen personality to match (if external beauty is a reflection of the inner soul, then I was transparent), my mother asked me to help her serve as host to out-of-town visitors.,The American Medical Association was having a convention in San Francisco, and my mother, a doctor's wife, was going to show around delegates' wives and children. She wanted to transform me into local color -- a Chinese-looking Chinese girl -- as we traipsed through San Francisco's Chinatown. Even though I was a thoroughly Americanized, third-generation Chinese-American, on that one day I was to slip into a cheongsam, the high-collared, snug, slit-skirted Chinese dress. I was to put on sheer stockings, precariously held up by a garter belt and slip my feet into Pappagallo shoes with two-inch heels.,It was an ill fit.,The cheongsam is not just a piece of clothing. It is a dress that demands an entire persona, a special way of walking, of holding the head high, of wearing your hair, crossing your legs and moving your arms. It is a hybrid of East and West, a garment that emerged in Shanghai in the 1930's. When the Chinese bound women's feet, they shrank the parameters of her world. And to a free-spirited American girl like me, the cheongsam did the same thing. It was silken bondage, a restriction of the mind and the body.,In the 19th century, the Manchu woman, who was a member of the ruling elite, wore a pao (pronounced pow), a long, loose robe that fastened on the right side. The pao was the woman's equivalent of the man's scholar robe in terms of comfort. In a pao, a woman was unencumbered. Then in the 1920's, when Hollywood costume designers started working with the bias cut, making dresses that clung to the body, so, too, Shanghai and Hong Kong tailors started cutting traditional robes closer to the body. Until then, all clothing in China, whether worn by the indigenous Han or their conquerors, the Manchu, including jackets, skirts, trousers and robes, had been loose-fitting.,The tailors of the 30's called the new snug and sexy dress the ''qi pao'' (the term is Mandarin for ''banner gown''), because it resembled the robe worn by Manchu women, who were called ''the women of the banner.'' The Cantonese word ''cheongsam'' means ''long gown,'' but ''qi pao'' and ''cheongsam'' are used interchangeably, said Valerie Steele, curator of ''China Chic: East Meets West,'' an exhibition of 125 pieces of traditional and modern clothing, on view at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan through April 24. ''The qi pao was a combination of the Chinese man's robe, the Manchu woman's long robe and the Western woman's frock,'' Ms. Steele said.,Long sleeves, once signifiers of modesty, became short. Cleavage was still hidden, but the slits inched higher and higher. In the 1960 film, ''The World of Suzie Wong,'' Suzie, the prostitute, wore her cheongsam slit to the thigh. Well-bred women were more demure, with their slits shorter and more discreet, but still revealing a few inches of upper leg. To elongate the line, women wore high heels and stockings. This long, sinuous silhouette implied a sleekness, a restrained sexuality.,Over all, the cheongsam is a paradoxical creation, sending out mixed messages, modest in the bodice (no cleavage) and brazen in the skirt (much thigh.) ''The idea of bodily modesty, of not showing your figure, walking in small steps and not extending your body in space -- that dates back to instruction books for women in the Han Dynasty, around the second century A.D.,'' said Dorothy Ko, a professor of Chinese history and women's studies at Rutgers University. ''Don't speak unless spoken to. Be demure. And if you're a woman, don't be visible.'',For my 16-year-old self, the descent into invisibility, also known as deep discomfort, began with the high, stiff collar. A swan might be happy in the cheongsam's collar, or maybe Marella Agnelli or Jacqueline de Ribes, European beauties famed for their lithe, long necks. But I have an ordinary neck, a scant few inches that attaches my head to my shoulders. Swanlike, I am not. When I buttoned the collar of the cheongsam, I began to choke psychically. I could breathe, but I could scarcely move. I was pinned and trapped, like the African women who wear dozens of necklaces around their necks.,I held my head in the only position possible: straight up, perpendicular to the street. Slouching was out of the question. So was tossing the head back in a fit of spontaneous laughter. I could tilt my head, in a slight, coy manner, like posters showing Chinese actresses and beauty queens. No doubt that was the point.,The dress -- a silvery-gray brocade with pale pink blossoms on it -- slipped over the breasts and fitted snug at the waist and over the belly. The hem glided just past my knees. My arms, gently restricted, were caught in the vise of little cap sleeves set in small, round armholes. I couldn't throw my arms up in the air like a cheerleader. I couldn't do the twist on a dance floor. At best, I could use my hands and flutter a few fingers. Exuberance vanished, and a coerced daintiness took its place.,The simple act of walking, putting one foot in front of the other, was no easy task. Since high heels were required, and the skirt was so narrow, I could only mince about. With my mother and her guests in tow, I minced down Grant Avenue to Union Square. I minced up California Street from Chinatown to the Fairmont Hotel. And as I moved, I worried constantly. Would my stockings snag? What if my dress, a slippery satin, slid up when I sat down and the garter belt showed? (This was B. P. -- before pantyhose.) What if the top of my stockings showed? The thigh?,If an inch of thigh poked out did that mean I was a bar girl? (No. I looked too gangly.) But it might give away the ruse that I was not a sophisticated denizen of the Orient, a creature who was enigmatic, mysterious and subtle.,On that one day, I pretended to be modest and full of grace, tethered to an ancient standard of decorum. As I blended in with the other Chinatown women, in my cheongsam, moving  willowlike down Grant Avenue, I became invisible, one of many small-stepping, black-haired women. The next day I would return to being a roller-skating, volleyball-playing, all-American teen-ager. But for a few awkward hours, I was a fake lady.",ELAINE LOUIE,"FEB. 28, 1999",VIEW; A Cheongsam Lesson at 16,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/style/view-a-cheongsam-lesson-at-16.html
"'NOSFERATU PHANTOM DER NACHT',Anchor Bay. $14.95. 107 minutes. (German with English subtitles.),'NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE',Anchor Bay.$14.95. 107 minutes. (English version),From the moment he answers his forbidding front door high in the Carpathians, one knows this is a different kind of Dracula. Starting with F. W. Murnau's classic count in ''Nosferatu'' in 1922 and running through Francis Ford Coppola's ravenous scourge in ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' in 1992, Draculas have been harsh, decisive types. Not that this fellow provides much of a letup, but there's something less unbending about him.,As envisioned by Werner Herzog in 1979's ''Nosferatu the Vampyre,'' this Dracula, portrayed with marvelous fluidity and emotion by Klaus Kinski, turns pensive and at times almost wistful. Physically he's on the small side, or that's the impression. The head is bald and skull-like, the complexion like chalk. His eyes are set deep in black holes and his ears flare from his head like Mercury's winged heels. Prominent incisors suggest the bat, as do the webbed claws that serve as hands.,There at Dracula's portal, quivering and lucky to have made it to this great musty pile of a place, stands the young clerk Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz), fresh (actually not so fresh after a four-week trek on foot and horseback) from the Netherlandsto conduct business. Dracula contemplates him for a long time with the knowing, what-have-we-here expression one associates with Dracula, tempered by a quizzical shyness.,Here is a vulnerable Dracula, one who is in pain and not averse to showing it. By way of explaining himself to Harker and later to Harker's stalwart wife, Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), whose lovely young neck he strongly admires and will soon partake of, he expresses his loneliness and despair. It's terrible not being able to die, he says, staring at her soulfully.,Amazingly, too, in contrast to other formidable Herzog films like ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God,'' there is something dryly funny about it. On these new wide-screen format tapes, Mr. Herzog's movie remains hauntingly atmospheric, with all its curious edges in place. For example, 11,000 rats brought by the Count from Transylvania are quite a sight on pristine Dutch streets, where they spread plague, inciting surreal scenes of madness and death.,Best viewed in its German version, ''there's more identity to it,'' Mr. Herzog said recently. He regards Murnau's ''Nosferatu'' as perhaps the best film ever made. Murnau was also German and a forefather to Mr. Herzog, who was born in 1942. ''Postwar German filmmakers had no fathers,'' he said. ''They were all either Nazis or they had been exiled. So we had to look back and connect with our grandfathers.'',Associating his film with Murnau's helped to make that link for Mr. Herzog. ''I felt as if I'd crossed a river and touched bottom on the other side,'' he said. ''I'm connected. I have ground under my feet.'',PETER M. NICHOLS",PETER M.

"JIMI HENDRIX: 'BAND OF GYPSIES',MCA, $14.95, 83 minutes.,It was for the most part a short-lived rehearsal band, a trio convened during Hendrix's transition time after the ''Electric Ladyland'' album, but Band of Gypsies must have been the best rehearsal band ever. Released by the Jimi Hendrix estate, this film operates out of the altogether sensible proposition that Band of Gypsies ought to be considered as a discrete project, different from the rest of Hendrix's career.,Hendrix had previously been flanked on stage by two white Englishmen, but at the end of 1969 he was playing with two black Americans: his army buddy, the bassist Billy Cox, and the drummer Buddy Miles. It was a racially loaded statement, and the music they made was blacker in two senses of the word: it was more rhythm-and-blues-based, and it was graver in tone. (Though, as the radio host Frankie Crocker attests, that still didn't gain Hendrix much of a foothold on black radio; to this day, he is perceived as the white rock fan's black hero.),Much of the remarkable Dec. 31, 1969, concert at New York's Fillmore East that was recorded for the live album ''Band of Gypsies'' is included here, and so are interviews with musicians and record producers. Hendrix, in a few interview sequences, comes across as a low-key, nonpolitical, angelic musical obsessive who refuses to believe his own hype:,''Some say you're the best guitarist alive,'' Dick Cavett says.,''How about the best guitarist sitting in this chair,'' Hendrix counters.,BEN RATLIFF",BEN RATLIFF,"FEB. 28, 1999",VIDEO; A Blacker Hendrix,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/video-a-blacker-hendrix.html

"The courtroom success that David Boies has enjoyed depends on thorough preparation, plenty of backup from lawyers for the Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft, and a steel-trap memory. He starts with a script but, far more than most lawyers, varies from it. He will let a witness give a rambling speech and then, seizing on a spoken sentence or two, he recalls a document among thousands in evidence that refutes the witness's testimony.,Microsoft insists that these ''gotcha moments'' of courtroom drama may be prominently reported in daily news accounts of the trial, but that they do not undermine the factual record of the case.,Whatever the legal impact, it is often an impressive performance -- made possible by Mr. Boies's formidable memory, which helps him overcome the fact that he is dyslexic. A late reader as a child, he still reads with difficulty. ''He overcompensates with an overwhelming memory,'' observed his wife, Mary Boies, who is also a lawyer.,In his defense of I.B.M. in a 13-year Federal antitrust case dropped in 1982, Mr. Boies, then a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, prepared to cross-examine the Government's economic witness by reading some background papers and being briefed for a half-hour by two colleagues. During the briefing, Mr. Boies wrote four words on a yellow legal pad, recalled another lawyer who worked on the case. He then cross-examined the Government's economist for five days with those four words as his notes. ''It was a tour de force,'' the lawyer recalled.,Mr. Boies, who left Cravath in 1997 to start his own firm, Boies & Schiller, is working for the Justice Department only on the Microsoft case. His rate works out to under $50 an hour, he figures, less than one-tenth his usual rate. By all accounts, it has been a bargain for the Government.,The Microsoft legal team is led by William Neukom, Microsoft's tall, silver-haired general counsel, and a corps of lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell including John Warden, Richard Urowsky and Steven Holley.,Mr. Neukom, 57, has been handling the company's legal affairs since 1979 when he was working at the Seattle law firm of the Microsoft chairman's father, William H. Gates Jr.. (The software entrepreneur is William H. Gates 3d.) The senior Mr. Gates asked Mr. Neukom to handle a lease for his son's 12-person software company, which was moving from Albuquerque to a Seattle suburb.,Mr. Neukom bridles at the suggestion that Microsoft's defense has stumbled badly. ''No one has an opinion that is worth a nickel unless he or she has read all the written testimony, read all the court transcripts and seen all the videotapes,'' he said.,The daily press coverage of the trial, he insists, is a distortion because the stories magnify a dramatic moment or two while largely ignoring the substance of the case.,The Boies approach, in Mr. Neukom's view, is to use the ''high jinks of courtroom theatrics to try to obscure the evidentiary record.'',Still, legal experts are skeptical. The Microsoft side, they say, has made a puzzling number of basic mistakes, noting that witnesses should not be surprised by documents or prior testimony.,''This case is the buzz of the legal community, and it's an embarrassment for Sullivan & Cromwell and Microsoft,'' said Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University Law School. ''The one way they can redeem themselves is to win, if not in this round then before the appeals court or the Supreme Court. It's always hard to argue with victory.''",STEVE LOHR,"FEB. 28, 1999","U.S. Ace in the Case: A Steel-Trap Memory, an Eye for the Jugular",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/us-ace-in-the-case-a-steel-trap-memory-an-eye-for-the-jugular.html
"The nation's largest apparel union has accused the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, the nation's largest shirtmaker, of undercutting workers' rights by closing its factory in Guatemala -- the only unionized factory among the more than 200 export-oriented apparel factories in that country.,Jay Mazur, president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said the factory closing was intended to warn apparel workers at other plants in Guatemala and Central America that if they voted to join a union their jobs would be in jeopardy.,But Bruce J. Klatsky, chairman of Phillips-Van Heusen, which is based in New York City, said that the union was blowing the plant closing out of proportion. He said the company had closed the Guatemala City factory because a large customer, Mercantile Stores, had turned to another company to make its shirts, leaving Phillips with too many factories.,Mr. Klatsky insisted that the decision to shut the plant had nothing to do with the fact that it was unionized. He noted that the company had closed two other plants in recent months.,''We face this problem pretty significantly,'' Mr. Klatsky said. ''We just couldn't maintain continuous and efficient production in a smooth fashion.'',Mr. Klatsky said his company, which also makes apparel under the G. H. Bass, Gant and Izod labels, was a leader among American apparel companies in terms of working conditions and factory monitoring.,Union officials said Phillips-Van Heusen was hypocritical, because it was one of the few companies participating in the White House anti-sweatshop task force and had agreed to take a tougher stance against poor working conditions than most other apparel makers.,In 1997, after a six-year struggle, the 500 employees at the Guatemala City factory obtained a union contract, which significantly improved their wages and the quality of the water at the plant.,''The contract these workers had was a beacon of hope for more than 80,000 maquiladora workers in Guatemala,'' Mr. Mazur said, referring to maquiladoras -- factories in special low-tariff zones that export almost all their output.,''By shutting the factory, Phillips-Van Heusen sent a message to other workers in Guatemala: If you fight for justice, if you fight for a union, we will not honor your contract.

"THE GROUP of female American tourists danced a crowd-stopping dance of the veil. Outside the vast shrine in the center of Mashad, Iran, the women struggled with their chadors, shroudlike garments that cover all but the face and must be secured with one hand held under the chin. There are no hooks or zippers to make the job easier.,It wasn't enough that we were already wearing scarves on our heads and loose garments that hid the shape of our torsos. This was the holiest pilgrimage site in Iran, the place where Imam Reza, the eighth of the 12 imams, or religious leaders, in Shiite Islam, died in the ninth century and is buried. And even though the shrine itself was off limits to non-Muslims, we were allowed to walk through the outer courtyard, watch an informational film at a foreign reception center and tour the museums on the vast compound. But only if we disguised ourselves in the veils that our guide handed out as we emerged from our bus.,Iranian schoolchildren giggled at the sight. A grizzled Iranian man asked to have his picture taken with us. One of the men in our group threw his sportcoat over his head and jumped into the picture.,''It's the equivalent of feet-binding in China, anything to keep women off-balance!'' complained Isabel Jacobs, a retired history teacher from Riverdale, in the Bronx.,''Before I came here, I believed in women's liberation,'' said Dorothy Wright, a retired teacher of English literature from Middletown, N.J. ''Now I believe in women's domination!'',Even I, who have been going to Iran as a journalist for 20 years, have never gotten used to this unwieldy garment, which lets me take notes only if I hold it together in my teeth.,In the early years of Iran's 1979 revolution, tourists -- particularly American tourists -- were considered dangerous invaders bent on sullying Islamic purity with Western culture. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,  the father of Iran's revolution, liked to rant about ''the Western sickness among us,'' stating plainly that ''there is no fun in Islam.'' Indeed, I never went to Iran for the night life.,These days, American tourists are no longer considered as ugly as they once were. Iran's regime is beginning to smile back, luring them with its treasures: the monumental ruins of ancient Persia, the intricately patterned mosques of Islam, the glittering palaces of the shahs, the landscapes of snowcapped mountains and rice paddies and palm-studded deserts. For about two years, intrepid Americans have ventured in, most of them on group tours organized by American and Canadian companies, but some on customized private visits.,The pace of the visits quickened after January 1998, when Iran's smiling President, Mohammed Khatami, used an interview with CNN to initiate a ''cultural exchange'' of intellectuals, artists and tourists to break down what he called ''the wall of mistrust'' between the United States and Iran. The steep drop in oil prices in the past year has contributed to Iran's eagerness to attract dollar-carrying Americans.,The family and friends of my 18 traveling companions thought they were crazy to come. We were, after all, in a country that the Clinton Administration considers the world's most active fomenter of terrorism, that once held American diplomats hostage and that has no official relations with the United States. Consular matters are handled by the Swiss, whose country represents American interests.,Indeed, in late November, just days after our return home, a bus carrying 17 American business executives returning to their hotel from the airport was attacked by a small band of angry young men wielding clubs and bats who smashed the bus windows and chanted in Farsi, ''God is great! Death to America!'',The driver sped off across town to another hotel, where the group sought refuge until they could make it safely back to their own. The Americans remained under the protection of the Swiss. The Swiss Ambassador escorted the group to the airport for its departure the next night.,Shortly before the attack, a hard-line newspaper had announced that the group included spies disguised as tourists. And afterward, the organization claiming responsibility issued a communique stating, ''Your children performed their first operation against American spies.'' It added, ''Iran is no place for American Yankees and our next operation will be the performance of our slogan 'Death to America.' '',No one was injured; Iranian officials loudly condemned the attack and American visitors have been left unharmed since then. But the incident was a chilling reminder that Iran is not a benign place, even to visit. And it just as easily could have been our group, which included a retired Navy captain and a retired Foreign Service officer.,But our small band was intrepid, well traveled and well prepared. Members talked knowingly of the volcanic sands of Guatemala, the cashews of Mozambique,  the barracudas of Belize. They carried medical kits that included sutures and hypodermic needles. They knew how to check the tires of domestic airplanes. They could find the 24-hour supermarket in Teheran to buy caviar and the synagogues in Isfahan on their own.,Our 14-day journey took us through Teheran, Mashad, Kermanshah, Hamadan, Kerman, Bam, Yazd, Shiraz, Persepolis, Isfahan, Kashan and Qum. We were free to go wherever we wanted and, except for military installations, airports, mosque interiors and some museums, took photographs as we wished.,The Americans came for various reasons. Lois Clark, a retired teacher, and her husband, Daniel, a retired radiologist, from Iowa, were struggling to understand the culture that shaped their Iranian-born son-in-law. Martha Habermann, who runs a nursing home in upstate New York, called it ''the frisson of doing something adventurous.'' Ronald Endeman, a lawyer from San Diego, counted Iran as the 235th country he has visited so far (but then, he counted places like Sicily and Hawaii as countries, too).,Our guide was Hossein Shams-ol-mali, a retired teacher who couldn't quite support himself and his wife on his small pension. No matter that his English was flawed and his explanations opaque. Mr. Shams, as we called him, was a gentleman, ever patient with our endless questions. (Why are there no dogs on the street? Do Jews serve in the Army? Do dervishes really whirl?) He also played bellman and waiter when necessary.,Our tour was run by Bestway Tours and Safaris, of Vancouver, British Columbia, although several of us who had booked through Absolute Asia, a New York-based company, didn't know that until we arrived. We also discovered that Bestway had charged tour members only $2,790 for their trip, excluding air fare; we had paid Absolute Asia $3,125. Absolute Asia explained in a letter that the additional cost covered ''personalized itinerary planning'' as well as visa processing. (In fact I had arranged my own visa.),Iran's tourist infrastructure functions surprisingly well, considering how few high-paying tourists have ventured in over the last two decades. The hotels built during the oil boom of the 1970's have seen better days, but have been renovated and function fairly well. Domestic air travel is cheap, remarkably safe and on time. Pharmacies are well stocked. Persian cuisine is a delight (when one can get away from the ubiquitous kabobs); fresh fruits and vegetables are grown throughout the country, and in Teheran the tap water is considered better than the bottled variety.,But our tour bus was in need of repair and cleaning. The air-conditioning blew hard through the holes where overhead lights should have been. There were no seat belts and no toilet. The choking air pollution from leaded gasoline fumes can be troubling for people with respiratory problems, particularly in the big cities such as Teheran and Isfahan.,Except at the mosques, the women in our group took risks with their dress almost from the start. Our guide made the mistake of telling us at our first orientation that we did not have to wear the poorly sewn, ankle-length polyester coats handed out at the beginning of the tour. So some women donned their husbands' shirts over pants and exchanged their scarves for hats. It was unseasonably hot, so we even dared to go bareheaded on the bus, which elicited wide-eyed stares (but no arrests).,Still, there were uncomfortable incidents when perfect strangers told us we were misbehaving. For instance, when one female tour member posed for a photograph with a group of giggling Iranian women in their chadors in Mashad, a man barked at the women not to allow their faces to be photographed.,Bending the rules did not extend to alcohol. When security guards at Teheran's Mehrabad Airport discovered several tiny bottles of liquor in the suitcase of one tour member, there were threats to confiscate our luggage, hold up our departure and even try the alleged culprit in an Iranian court. Eventually, the security guard and airport police were paid off; we made our flight.,There were times when political reality and the official animosity toward the United States intruded. Some of my fellow travelers were offended by a neon sign at Teheran's airport announcing in English that, ''In future, Islam will destroy Satanic sovereignty of the West.'',''With one hand they're telling us we're demons,'' said Ms. Wright. ''With the other hand, they're taking our money.'',We happened to be in Isfahan on the 19th anniversary of the seizure of the United States Embassy in Teheran, which began the 444-day nightmare of American diplomats held hostage and led to the rupture of diplomatic relations with Iran. Banners hanging throughout the city proclaimed ''Death to America'' in Farsi and ''Down With U.S.A.'' in English. We were kept far away from the city's demonstration --  largely of schoolchildren bused in for the event -- at a sports stadium.,The lead story on the television news that night showed footage from demonstrations in more than a dozen cities around the country. The only problem was that some of the footage obviously came from the archives. Still, members of our group were not amused. ''I've been smiling at people up to now,'' said Fritz Wright, a retired engineer. ''At this point I don't know whether to smile at them or not.'',Our tour did not include a drive-by of the confiscated American Embassy compound in Teheran, for years a school for training revolutionary guards. But I took two of the members of our group for a firsthand look on our last day. Its walls had been freshly painted with anti-American images, including a giant head of a skeleton as the Statue of Liberty.,THROUGHOUT the trip, the official animosity towards the United States Government contrasted sharply with the shock and sheer joy of ordinary Iranians in encountering Americans who liked Iran well enough to come touring. ''In China, people come up to you and talk, but they don't kiss you and say they love you like they do here,'' said Ms. Habermann. When I told a porter in the hotel in Hamadan, which is off the foreign tourist track, where I was from, he looked bewildered. ''Who let you in?'' he asked.,What makes it especially difficult to penetrate the country is that Iranians operate in two worlds. Behavior is much more relaxed in the privacy of one's home, where even the most devout Muslim women remove their head coverings. And in secular families, one may even be offered a shot of bootleg vodka or a glass of homemade wine. For the most part, our group operated in a parallel universe, seeing the externals.,But there were moments of discovery, many of them disheartening. Katharine Loring, an emergency room nurse and bicyclist, said that Iran would be a great place to take a bike trek, but then learned that men and women must ride bikes on segregated tracks. Mr. Endeman, the lawyer, gave a young Iranian woman friend of mine a good-bye hug in front of our hotel in Shiraz, and she recoiled in fear: Men and women who are not close relatives are not even supposed to shake hands.,Inside the shrine of the brother of Imam Reza in Shiraz, where women wept and moaned as they begged God for favors, Ms. Loring cuddled the baby of a mother of two. ''Take my baby to America,'' the mother said matter-of-factly. ''She is better off growing up there.'' When Ms. Loring balked, the woman said she could take her 7-year-old daughter instead, much to the horror of the girl, who clutched her mother's leg.,The American women were incensed that Iranian women have to ride in the back of the bus. And then there was the incident of the restaurant toilets in in Shiraz. The men's was a familiar Western, chairlike model; the women's was, as in most places, a porcelain hole in the ground that required squatting. The women simply barged past the male attendant into the men's room.,And it was those restrictions, those arbitrary limits on freedom, that irritated Mel Jiganti, a retired judge from Chicago who came carrying a paperback copy of the Koran. ''The only other place I've ever felt like this was in the Army, when I had a sergeant who had arbitrary power over me,'' he said.,Then the magic of Iran took over.,We sought refuge from the stares and smog on the footpaths of the enormous Bagh-e Eram in Shiraz, a sprawling public garden filled with 200-year-old cypress, pomegranate, salt cedar and sour cherry trees, musk roses, coxcomb and honeysuckle.,We soaked in the view of palm groves in the desert from the top of the medieval mud-walled citadel and town at Bam, then sipped mango juice at a charming teahouse there run by an Iranian woman who beckoned with the words, ''We are waiting for you.'',We left the world of Shiite Islam far behind in Hamadan at a mausoleum with a basket of yarmulkes at the entrance and a wall engraved with the Ten Commandments in Hebrew. There, according to legend, Esther and Mordecai are buried.,We discovered a wedding reception at our hotel one evening in Shiraz and ventured in for a peek. The sister of the bride introduced us around to the other women, dressed in fancy cocktail dresses, their hair lacquered, their faces beautifully made up. They danced in a conga line led by the bride. The men, meanwhile, were banished to a separate room, just as at an Orthodox Jewish wedding.,But it was Persepolis, the seat of Persia's ancient kings and Iran's most important archeological treasure, that awed the Americans. Walking through the vast remains of the palace started in the sixth century B.C. by Darius the Great reduced our garrulous group to few words.,So should Americans who have been everywhere else go to Iran? ''If you wait until it gets more efficient, all the spontaneity and surprise will be lost,'' said Cynthia Katz, a part-time travel agent from Nyack, N.Y.,  as we walked through the vast, perfectly proportioned 17th-century  square in the center of Isfahan. ''When this place starts looking like the Sistine Chapel with wall-to-wall people, it's not going to be fun anymore.'',But Thomas H. Miner, the chairman of the Chicago-based Mid-America Committee, who had led the tour of the Americans who were attacked, admitted in an interview that he might have gone to Iran too soon. ''I don't think Iranians are ready for Americans -- even tourists,'' he said. ''I don't think there is anyone in that country who can protect you.'',Arranging a trip,Logistics,It's hard to go it alone as a tourist in Iran. Technically, tourists must be invited by the Iranian Government. A number of American companies provide organized tours and can facilitate the visa application process. In the absence of diplomatic relations, it is probably safer traveling with a tour operator known to Iranian authorities. Inventive travelers can add on their own personalized itineraries. On our tour one woman in her 60's spent several days before our arrival traveling with a female guide to the ancient ruins in Susa, and several days afterward at the Caspian Sea. She said this part of the trip went better than our tour.,Traveling with a prepaid tour also allows one to avoid taking a large amount of cash. The embargo theoretically precludes Iranians from cashing traveler's checks drawn on American banks or accepting American credit cards. However, on this trip I used a Mastercard from Chase Manhattan at hotels in Teheran and  Isfahan. The staff could not explain how it circumvented the embargo.,Tour Companies,I bought my tour through Absolute Asia in New York, (800) 736-8187; it was operated by Bestway Tours and Safaris (see below). Tour members who booked through Bestway paid less than the $3,125 a person that Absolute Asia charged. Ken Fish, president of Absolute Asia, said the company was now dealing directly with an Iranian company and had 15-night tours for $2,625 and $2,895 a person.,Other companies selling tours to Iran include the following:,Bestway Tours and Safaris, Vancouver, British Columbia, (800) 663-0844.,Cyrus Travel in San Jose, Calif., (800) 332-9787.,Distant Horizons in Long Beach, Calif., (800) 333-1240.,Geographic Expeditions in San Francisco, (800) 777-8183.,It is possible to put together an itinerary directly with an Iranian company such as Iran Ziggurat Tour and Travel Agency, (9821) 643-9539,  fax (9821) 643-9538.,A number of Western airlines fly to Iran, and tickets can be booked through tour operators. I use V.T.S. Travel, (703) 790-9779, a small agency in Vienna, Va., owned by Vajihe Tahbaz, charming Iranian woman.,Hotels,Many of the better hotels were once part of American hotel chains and have been renovated. Most hotel personnel speak English.,Of the eight hotels where we stayed during our tour, only one, the Akhavan Hotel in Kerman, was inadequate. Guests complained of leaky toilets, dirty carpets and insects.,Here are some hotels of note; tax of 18 percent is added to all rates.,ISFAHAN  Grand Abbasi Hotel, (98-31) 22-6011, fax (98-31) 22-6008. This 218-room hotel built around the skeleton of a caravanserai is by far the best place to stay in Iran, with dazzling carpets, tile work and carvings. Ask for a room in the original part of the hotel. Doubles start at $95.,SHIRAZ  Homa Hotel, (98-71) 28-001, fax (98-71) 48-021, has been renovated and provides good service.It is where wealthy local people hold their weddings. Doubles from $95.,TEHERAN  Karoon Hotel, (98-21) 890-1848, fax (98-21) 890-1962, is a small, simple inexpensive hotel in the center of Teheran with a welcoming manager, worn carpets and temperamental plumbing and phones. Doubles from $40.,Laleh Hotel, (98-21) 65-5021, fax (98-21) 65-5517, has towels and glasses still bearing the Inter-Continental logo. Most of the staff is friendly and eager to please. Doubles from $99.,Homa Hotel, the former Sheraton, (98-21) 877-3021, fax (98-21) 879-7179, is newer than the Laleh, but the staff is not as nice. Doubles from $120.,Food,Many of Iran's best restaurants (and all its fine wine cellars) closed with the coming of the revolution 20 years ago. Our group ate mainly in hotels, where the food was plentiful and reliable but not special. The best  way to dine in Iran is to get invited to a private home, difficult but not impossible even for first-time visitors because Iranians are so hospitable.,One of my favorite restaurants is Ali Qapoo in Teheran, (98-21) 878-4120, less because of the food than the lively atmosphere and the musicians (only male) who play traditional music. Dinner, about $33 for two.,There are many different kinds of khoresh, slowly simmering stews served with rice. The best is khoresh fesenjoon, a duck stew cooked in walnut and pomegranate sauce.,Caviar is expensive in restaurants, when it is available; better to go to the 24-hour Refah supermarket chain in Teheran. Good hotels have refrigerators in the rooms.   ELAINE SCIOLINO,Caveat,The United States State Department, in its April 1998 Travel Warning on Iran, toned down its previous warning to reflect President Khatami's call for dialogue and an increase in private exchanges between Iranians and Americans. However, it still warns United States citizens to defer travel to Iran.,American travelers should register their passport information with the Foreign Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in,Teheran, which handles legal and consular matters for Americans but does not offer full consular services.

"The new National Center for Popular Music is scheduled to open tomorrow in Sheffield in northern England, 165 miles from London. Sheffield is the home of the well-known pop music groups Pulp and Def Leppard (it was also made famous in the 1997  film ''The Full Monty''). The center was created to inform visitors about the history and impact of pop music.,The building, which was designed by Branson Coates Architecture, a British firm, consists of four large stainless steel drums, each with 32,300 square feet of space for permanent exhibitions, and also houses a space for temporary shows, cafe, bar and shop. The opening exhibition focuses on albums or music that have most influenced the lives of celebrities.,The permanent exhibitions are housed in each of the four drums. ''Perspectives'' celebrates the music's diversity and its influences. Themes include the power of love songs, the importance of dance, and popular music's relationship with social change. ''Making Music'' examines how popular music is created, recorded and distributed;  visitors can play an instrument, mix a record, design a record sleeve or present a radio show. In ''Turning Points,'' four 10-minute, large-scale films are shown across three screens reflecting the global impact of popular music, and a huge glass World Wall allows visitors to listen to sounds from around the world. Data bases provide information about 800 significant artists and groups. The fourth drum, ''Soundscapes,'' features a 200-seat auditorium where ''ambisonic'' sound will use 16 speakers in two rings of 8 to move sounds around the auditorium, as opposed to merely from the side and rear.,The National Center for Popular Music, Paternoster Row, Sheffield, will be open from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.

"ONE of Turkey's most imposing archeological monuments, a collection of ancient thrones and giant busts on Mount Nemrut in the eastern part of the country, is deteriorating and in urgent need of protection, according to archeologists and other experts.,The Nemrut ruins are the legacy of  a little-known kingdom called Commagene, which gained its independence from the Seleucids in 162 B.C. and was annexed to  the Roman province of Syria 234 years later. Historians call the kingdom semi-Iranian, and its kings professed a version of the Zoroastrian faith.,Pre-eminent among these kings was Antiochus I, and it was he who built the colossal heads and the rest of the vast monument on Mount Nemrut, which lies in the Anatolian highlands 510 miles east of Ankara and 100 miles north of the Syrian border. The heads, some of them nine feet high, represent deities, among them Zeus, Hercules and Apollo, as well as eagles, lions and the king himself, together with his ancestors. He built it as a funerary monument to himself in the hope that he would be remembered long after his death, and it seems he succeeded. One travel guide describes the Nemrut ensemble, which includes reliefs, a cave cistern and ruins of columns, as ''one of the most awesome sights in all of Anatolia.'' Another calls Antiochus ''a deluded king and creator of this grandiose folly.'',Until the 1960's, when a rough road was built to the mountaintop, it was accessible only by foot, a walk of two days. The road is now paved, and the site draws many tourists, among them American soldiers from the Incirlik air base 220 miles away.,Unesco placed Mount Nemrut on its list of World Heritage Sites in 1987, and it was made a national park the following year. As more people became aware of the site, efforts were made to protect it, but none has been carried to completion.,''Although it has received public attention around the world since its discovery in 1881, the Nemrut monument has never been fully appreciated in Turkey,'' the archeologist Nezih Basgelen wrote in a new book about the site. ''Unfortunately, just as earthquakes and the harsh climate in the region have taken a toll on the monument, uncontrolled, ever-increasing tourism also threatens the site.,''One solution to this problem is to move the original statuary and steles to a protected area and replace them with copies,'' Mr. Basgelen suggested. ''Before further damage occurs, a comprehensive restoration and conservation project must be undertaken on Mount Nemrut.'',A Dutch businessman and architect, Maurice Crijns, has formed a foundation aimed at preserving the Nemrut monument. The foundation has produced a five-year plan that Mr. Crijns estimates would cost $2.7 million. He said the foundation can pay for the first year or two of work, and he believes that private donors will provide the rest once the project begins. The plan has been endorsed by Turkey's culture ministry, but for reasons that are not clear, the ministry has not given him final permission to begin. Asked for comment, the ministry said that Mr. Crijns's plan was ''still under consideration.'',Mr. Crijns recently met with President Suleyman Demirel and received his blessing for the project. But so far even that has not produced final permission for work to begin. ''Many people in Turkey don't know how valuable this monument is,'' Mr. Crijns said. ''It's very unknown, and unknown makes unloved. You can see pictures of it in every travel agency in Holland, but they never say where it is.,''The problem is that the monument is deteriorating very fast, partly because of nature and partly by the hands of humans,'' he continued. ''If it is not protected, within a few years there will be nothing to protect anymore. Part of the monument is made from soft sandstone, which cannot bear the harsh climate or the kind of treatment it is getting from people. They are having picnics on the rocks, making fires -- well, let me not start complaining.'',Under the preservation plan drawn up by Mr. Crijns and his International Nemrut Foundation, based in the Dutch town of Eindhoven, guards would be posted at the site, the giant statues would be restored, sandstone reliefs would be given protective shields, and a museum would be established.,''Last October the culture ministry told us we had permission to begin work and that we should bring our team,'' Mr. Crijns said.  ''We were all there -- people from Holland, Germany and Turkey -- but the dossier did not arrive. We called Ankara and they said 'No problem, it will come tomorrow.' But it never came, and after a week we had to send everyone home.''",STEPHEN KINZER,"FEB. 28, 1999",TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; Ozymandias Endangered In Eastern Turkey,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-ozymandias-endangered-in-eastern-turkey.html
"Honduras and Belize have announced that they are open and eager for tourist business. Although Hurricane Mitch visited the area at the end of October, its impact on the tourist infrastructure was less severe than on other facilities. Diving, for instance, a major attraction in both countries, is reported to be in full swing, with many island piers in Honduras rebuilt.,The Honduran Ministry of Tourism in Tegucigalpa said early this month that the last two of the major island resorts that suffered damage had reopened on Feb. 1: Posada del Sol on Guanaja, where the hurricane hovered for 39 hours with winds up to 273 miles an hour, and Anthony's Key on nearby Roatan.,Posada del Sol reconstructed its buildings and piers. Anthony's Key completed new cabins on stilts that were described as having the same rustic appeal as before the storm, but with some improvements. The Bayman Bay Club, the other major resort on Guanaja, reopened in December; Linda Fouke, a spokeswoman, said that dive boats were taking divers out three times a day.,Belize was only slightly damaged, but assumptions that it was devastated by the storm, which was estimated to have left 10,000 dead in Honduras and Nicaragua, have reduced tourism.

The hotel they thought they knew probably seems vaguely different as they enter the lobby, because of a recently completed three-year interior renovation by the architect Adam D. Tihany in conjunction with Lea Mahler of Jerusalem.,Mr. Tihany, noted for designing restaurants like Le Cirque 2000 and Remi in New York, said he tried to ''keep the perception of the six-story King David while changing the patina,'' by sticking to the original scale and colors of the hotel. The same blue, white and gold decor and the marble floor predominate.,The sense of change should grab hold in the rooms, which were reconfigured and redecorated. The number of rooms was reduced to 237, from 255, of which 37 are suites, an increase of 13. Four of them are duplexes. Each room has new furniture and lighting.,Perhaps the most obvious change is the moving of La Regence, the restaurant destroyed in 1946 by a bomb placed by Menachem Begin's guerrillas, to a central spot under the terrace facing the Old City.,Doubles at the King David, 23 King David Street, Jerusalem 94101, start at $306, including breakfast. Suites cost $685 to $2,013 a night. Reservations: (972-2) 620-8888, fax (972-2) 620-8882; www.danhotels.com.

"The accused, one of the most powerful ministers in the country, asked God to influence the jurors' hearts and minds. But the minister, the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, who used the trust given him as a man of God to steal millions, found himself without divine help in a Florida courtroom.,In Pinellas County Circuit Court here today, Mr. Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc., the nation's largest black religious organization, was convicted of racketeering and grand theft, including charges that he had stolen money that was donated to a fund to rebuild black churches destroyed by arson.,Mr. Lyons, who had used the money to live a lavish life style that included a $700,000 waterfront home, a time-share condominium in Lake Tahoe, Nev., luxury cars and expensive jewelry, stood still as the verdict was read. The only thing that moved was his Adam's apple as he swallowed hard when the clerk of the court read ''guilty.'',The man who had once punctuated his sermons against sin with cries of ''I'm doing some preaching now!'' walked quietly from the courtroom, saying only that he was ''going to my church,'' to pray. Mr. Lyons, 57, faces a sentence of five to eight and a half years in prison on the charges.,For more than a month, prosecutors tried to convince a jury that Mr. Lyons had, with the help of his aide Bernice Edwards, used the good name and bogus membership lists of the 100-year-old National Baptist Convention to bilk millions from companies wanting to do business with black customers.,The evidence against the minister ''was overwhelming,'' one juror, Shannon Byrd, told reporters as she left the courtroom. But the same jury that found Mr. Lyons guilty of racketeering would, just moments later, acquit Ms. Edwards, who, prosecutors asserted, had worked hand in hand with Mr. Lyons.,Ms. Edwards, 42, sobbed quietly into the shoulder of her lawyer when the verdict was read.,''It's been so long,'' she said of the 28-day trial, her voice just above a whisper. ''I thank God and I thank my lawyer. It's been very hard.'',Ms. Edwards faced one racketeering count and was not charged in the scheme to steal money from the fund for burned black churches.,Prosecutors were happy with the verdict for Mr. Lyons, who, they asserted, betrayed the faith that he used, as his cover, to make money.,The National Baptist Convention describes itself as the nation's largest black religious organization, with more than 8.5 million members. It was access to that membership, which prosecutors said was grossly inflated, that companies wanted so they could peddle life insurance, burial plots and credit cards.,Mr. Lyons, who is out on bond while he awaits sentencing, is scheduled to stand trial in April in Federal court on 54 counts of tax evasion, extortion and money laundering. Ms. Edwards also faces similar charges in Federal court.,The verdict, which the jury reached this morning, was delayed until this afternoon when two Tampa Bay television stations gave defense lawyers copies of E-mail messages from a man who said a juror, Ms. Byrd, had discussed the jury's deliberations with a friend.,Lawyers for Mr. Lyons and Ms. Edwards requested a mistrial. But the trial judge, Susan Schaeffer, skeptical that something as flimsy as a mysterious E-mail message could negate a jury's verdict, questioned Ms. Byrd.,''No, m'am,'' Ms. Byrd said, when asked whether she had discussed the case. Later, she told reporters, ''I didn't do any of that.'',It was just the latest development in a case that often strayed outside the norm of criminal cases.,Specifically, the two defendants were charged on a single count of racketeering, involving several instances, prosecutors said, in which they promised to sell bogus lists and access to the National Baptist Convention's supposed membership of 8.5 million. Prosecutors said the figure was probably closer to 1 million.,Mr. Lyons was also charged with grand theft, with stealing most of about $240,000 donated to his organization by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money that was supposed to be distributed to black churches that had been destroyed by arson.,It was a trial in which the name of God was invoked again and again, mostly by lawyers for Mr. Lyons and Ms. Edwards, whom they described as His servants.,But as the two defendants tried to cloak themselves in religion, and as their lawyers tried to convince jurors that when money was floated into his personal account, it was just the way that black churches ''do business,'' prosecutors hammered again and again at their credibility with bank statements, letters and other hard evidence.,Throughout the trial, prosecutors documented specific instances of what they said was theft. The prosecution produced two letters from  Mr. Lyons to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, falsely reporting that the money it had donated to the burned black churches had been distributed.,Prosecutors produced a document in which the National Baptist Convention had estimated its state-by-state membership -- a list that Mr. Lyons had used in his scheme, the prosecution said. In some states, the organization reported a black membership that exceeded the number of black residents in those states.,But even as the documents and other evidence piled up around them, Mr. Lyons and his lawyers predicted that God would deliver him and Ms. Edwards from what they called the persecution of the state.,As the jury, five white women and one white man, began deliberations on Thursday afternoon, the two defendants and a group of about 25 close associates joined hands in the courthouse hallway and sang ''What a Friend We Have in Jesus.'' Then a supporter and member of the Baptist organization, the Rev. Charles Emery of Gary, Ind., led the group in a rousing prayer.,''Our Father, we need your intervention,'' Mr. Emery said, asking  God to help the jury make the ''right'' verdict.,''We need you to work on their hearts,'' he said as the people in the circle shouted ''Yes, Jesus!'' and one man loudly stomped his feet. ''We need you to work on their minds.'',Then, as tears filled the eyes of some in the circle, Mr. Emery made a prediction: ''We claim the victory right here.'',When he was done, Mr. Lyons's wife, Deborah, hugged a weeping Ms. Edwards. It was Mrs. Lyons who began the investigation into her husband's business dealing and lavish life style, when, in July 1997, she set fire to a $700,000 waterfront home he had bought with Ms. Edwards. Mrs. Lyons was convicted of arson and was sentenced to probation.,Later, Mrs. Lyons would say she did not suspect her husband of having an affair with Ms. Edwards and stood by her husband throughout the trial. Ms. Edwards denied having had an affair with Mr. Lyons.,Others stood by him, as well. His church, Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church in nearby St. Petersburg, retained him as pastor, and leaders in the National Baptist Convention voted to keep him as president, even as some members worried that he would drag the organization's reputation down with him.",RICK BRAGG,"FEB. 28, 1999",Top Baptist Official Is Guilty of Stealing And Business Fraud,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/top-baptist-official-is-guilty-of-stealing-and-business-fraud.html
"The eighth highest point in Manhattan is about to disappear.,With a bit of a flourish and more than a bit of wrangling, a 180-foot-long boom -- a steel structure almost the length of a city block -- was scheduled to be lowered early this morning to 42d Street from the tower crane atop 4 Times Square, the Conde Nast building. That is, wind and weather permitting.,Since last summer, when the crane finished climbing to the top of the 51-story tower it helped build, the boom tip has been been poised nearly 900 feet over Times Square, becoming a point on the skyline almost rivaling the Citicorp Center.,By the end of next week, if all goes as planned, not a trace will remain of the crane, which is worth about $1 million.,Its removal answers a question that has puzzled many New Yorkers about tower cranes: once a building is built, just how are the cranes taken down?,The answer -- besides ''very carefully'' -- turns out to be straightforward. The tower crane is used to erect a smaller crane, called a stiff-leg derrick, on the rooftop. The tower crane is broken down, and the derrick lowers it to the street in stages, starting with the boom.,Then the derrick is taken apart into pieces that can fit into a hoist or freight elevator. Down it goes to the ground, and off to the next job.,The public rarely witnesses these operations because they are scheduled at night or on weekends when there is the least traffic.,At 4 Times Square, there is a bit of a hitch because of the complex, constricted nature of the rooftop.,''We don't have room on the roof to lay the boom down and disassemble it,'' said Mel Ruffini, a vice president of the Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction manager. ''That's why it's being brought down in one section.'',Mr. Ruffini said wind would be a critical factor in deciding whether to proceed. If the maneuver is postponed, it will be put off until next Sunday, since 42d Street will have to be closed temporarily.,Four Times Square is an especially sensitive site because there have been construction accidents there, including a catastrophic collapse of a subcontractor's scaffolding in July. Thereza Feliconio, 85, was killed as pieces of steel crashed into her room in the Woodstock Hotel across the street. Times Square was snarled for days, and one block of 43d Street was closed for a month.,The tower crane has not been implicated in the accidents, however. And city officials and industry executives said tower cranes have a good record overall. The more frequently reported accidents involve mobile cranes at street level or smaller, unlicensed derricks. In January 1998, for example, a smaller 40-foot crane at the site fell while lifting a load of granite.,''We very rarely have a problem with a tower crane,'' said Gaston Silva, the city's Buildings Commissioner. ''In general, the tower cranes are very safe.'',Tower cranes are operated by licensed riggers. The cranes and derricks division of the Buildings Department reviews the assembly and dismantling procedures and also inspects the equipment before and after it is erected.,''Tower cranes, because they're larger, heavier and more complicated, are treated more carefully,'' said Jay P. Shapiro, principal engineer at Howard I. Shapiro & Associates, a structural engineering firm specializing in cranes and derricks. ''For the volume of construction and the number of cranes in use, it's remarkable how few accidents there are.'',Two tower cranes were used to build 4 Times Square: a Favco 1500 with a 181-foot boom and an FMC TG1900 with a 180-foot boom and a 10-foot extension. Both are owned by the Canron Construction Corporation, the structural steel subcontractor. The Conde Nast building is being developed by the Durst Organization and was designed by Fox & Fowle.,The cranes climbed upward through the building as it rose, lifting themselves from floor to floor. In April, the TG1900 took down the Favco and continued its ascent, reaching its high point in June.,All told, the TG1900 made 250 to 300 ''picks,'' as the lifting maneuver is called, handling steel girders, facade panels and cooling and heating equipment. Its last big job was on Feb. 8, when it hoisted an emergency generator to the rooftop.,Early last week, the tripod-like derrick was built. It sits on the rooftop, as green and angular as a giant praying mantis.,The derrick has four cables and can hoist a 35-ton load. The boom of the tower crane, the heaviest load that the derrick will handle, weighs 17 tons. Elio Cettina, the general superintendent of the 4 Times Square project for Tishman, said workers stationed in the street would use long lines to keep the crane boom from swinging during its journey down.,After the boom is lowered, the rest of the crane will follow over four or five days: the gantry, mast, counterweights and mechanical deck, including the winch and operator's cab. The crane will be taken to a yard in South Plainfield, N.J., for refurbishing.,Where will it go next?,Although cranes are often shipped cross country and sometimes overseas, this particular TG1900 will probably be used to construct 3 Times Square, the Reuters building, for which Tishman is also the construction manager.,''Unless there's a prior commitment,'' Mr. Cettina said, ''it will come back to Times Square in the middle of the summer.''",DAVID W.

"DREAMLAND,By Kevin Baker.,519 pp. New York:,HarperCollins Publishers. $26.,KEVIN BAKER'S jampacked novel of New York City circa 1910 rushes between lower Manhattan and Coney Island like a wild amusement-park ride on a continuous loop. The author shanghais all sorts of real-life Tammany pols, Bowery gangsters, factory girls and carnival attractions to join his own inventions inside a book that teems with violence, humor, information and hustle. ''Dreamland'' is historical fiction at its most entertaining and, in a number of spots, most high-handed.,The novel's whirligig of plots more or less all proceed from an incident that follows a heavily bet dog-and-rat fight in a basement off Baxter Street. Kid Twist incurs the lasting enmity of his fellow gangster Gyp the Blood when he hits Gyp with a shovel in order to save a newsboy (or so he thinks) from having his back broken across Gyp's knee. Now on the run from ''the most dangerous lunatic in New York,'' Kid soon makes matters much worse by romancing a girl he doesn't know is Gyp's sister Esther.,The little fellow Kid has saved is actually Trick the Dwarf, a performer at Coney Island's newest and most magical park, Dreamland. Trick sometimes likes to pass for a newsboy, since ''with a little makeup, I could not only hide my misshapen body, I could be young again. And what, after all, is the greater deformity -- size or age?'' In gratitude for his rescue from Gyp, Trick hides Kid Twist at Coney Island's Tin Elephant Hotel, where eventually Esther joins him. Trick himself is in love with the tiny, enchantingly mad Carlotta, whom he contrives to make queen of a built-to-scale Little City, the novel's version of Lilliput, a community of 300 midgets that actually existed in Dreamland.,Trying to overcome the same tenement life her brother escaped through crime, Esther first toils in a sweatshop, stitching sleeve linings for coats, and later takes a job at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory. With the encouragement of Clara Lemlich -- the bravest kochleffl (rabble-rouser) of all the young working women and a real-life activist who can be found in histories of the great Triangle fire -- Esther is transformed from wage slave to agitator.,Lumbering between the worlds of labor and crime and amusement is Big Tim Sullivan, the sentimental political boss and investor in Coney Island. A builder of the crude ethnic bridges that would create the city's modern body politic (''Big Tim's specialty had always been Jews''), Sullivan pushed through labor reforms and the famous law against concealed weapons that bears his name even as he stole elections and -- as Baker has it -- stood behind the famous murder of the gambler Herman Rosenthal, for which the police lieutenant Charles Becker was eventually executed.,''Dreamland'' is terrific fun, though ultimately something less than the sum of its gaudy episodes. Its gangland and labor narratives tend to move in more predictable increments than the action out at Coney Island; Trick, the only character whose tale gets told in the first person, becomes the most real and affecting one in the novel. The book's best lines belong to him: ''Ours was the most credulous of ages, for everything came true.'' Baker manages to throw everything together for a fiery dual climax -- Dreamland and the Triangle factory both burned in 1911 -- but the 500-page ride to it provides a lot of bumps along with the thrills. Baker works his italicized refrains rather hard and occasionally seems to be blocking the movie instead of writing the book. Frequent interruptions to follow Freud and Jung on their roughly contemporaneous American travels add nothing.,Baker is also the author of ''Sometimes You See It Coming'' (1993), a delightful baseball novel with some of the same vividness and ramshackle construction displayed by ''Dreamland.'' He has more recently worked as Harold Evans's chief researcher on ''The American Century,'' an experience that no doubt helped him stuff his new book with all its song and food and spectacles.,In a concluding note on his sources, Baker offers a modest manifesto for historical fiction, saying its essential obligations are to ''a good story,'' ''human nature'' and ''an essential core of truth'' -- which is to say, the forest of plausibility instead of every factual tree. He confesses to a number of chronological manipulations -- allowing, for instance, George McClellan, ''son of the famous Civil War flop by the same name,'' to preside as Mayor over the book's action, even though McClellan had left office before the novel's principal events occurred. Baker hopes that readers will ''amuse themselves sniffing out the real, unnamed, historical personages'' he has put into the narrative. Some readers may, but their amusement can only make them conscious of the author and his method; it will hardly keep their disbelief suspended.,All historical fiction requires manipulation and outright lying, but rearrangement of the public record on the scale conducted by Baker really makes for an allied genre one might call ''historical fantasy,'' a worthy but more perilous endeavor. Readers who don't know the history end up misinformed; those who do know it may end up irritated or perplexed.,Baker provides so much pleasure here that one hates to complain, but he might be better off with a clearer set of rules for himself. Naming a composite of ''the great Coney Island entrepreneurs'' after his brother-in-law (Matthew Brinckerhoff, acknowledged in the notes) is a charming self-indulgence, on the order of the inconspicuous self-image a cathedral sculptor puts amid the bigger gargoyles. Naming two Triangle factory foremen ''Kristol'' and ''Podhoretz'' is a lousy joke, and a sure-fire illusion killer for every scene in which the two appear.,The publicity for ''Dreamland'' inevitably pronounces it ''in the tradition of E. L. Doctorow's 'Ragtime.' '' I would venture to say, even with all the reservations above, that ''Dreamland'' is the better book. Its history and biography are less potted, and more often than not it truly inhabits its characters and era. There is a coldness to Doctorow's famous and much more pulled-together novel, a latter-day superiority that doesn't do emotional or moral justice to the period it's reconstructing. There's nothing arm's-length about Baker. He loves all the ''cigars, and oysters and roasting corn, the shady characters and the women of bad reputation'' he can crowd onto the page. ''Ragtime'' remains just that, a time, whereas Baker rightly tries to treat the past as a place, whose strange shoreline he's just sighted, like one of the startled immigrants in his bounteous book.",THOMAS MALLON,"FEB. 28, 1999",Time and Again,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/time-and-again.html

"JONATHAN SEGAL, an architect turned developer, says he builds ''affordable urban boxes.'' In the last eight years, when few others were building downtown, Mr. Segal completed seven of his small loft and row-house developments.,Mr. Segal's designs typically call for two-  to three-story stucco buildings, with compact living spaces, 18-foot ceilings, tall windows and ''garden'' patios. ''I'm not designing for families,'' said the 36-year-old Mr. Segal. ''I'm designing for hip, urban singles.'',He is one of a small group of architects building creative infill projects targeting younger residents who until recently couldn't afford to live in downtown San Diego.,Mr. Segal's most recently completed project is Kettner Row, 16 row houses in Little Italy, a 50-block neighborhood of warehouses, offices and small restaurants on San Diego Harbor. Called ''convertible housing,'' the project is designed to allow the owner to use the street level space as an office or studio.,The houses, with 1,280 to 1,800 square feet of space, sold as soon as they were finished in 1998 for prices ranging from $190,000 to $265,000. The residents, mostly 25 to 40 years old, include a lawyer, a real estate agent and an artist.,Scott Woods, a 38-year-old hotel consultant, rents one of the row houses for $1,400 a month. Tired of commuting, he moved downtown from the suburbs three years ago.,''I have one wall that's all glass,'' Mr. Woods said. ''I didn't expect to find something like this in the middle of the city.'',The redevelopment of Little Italy is an experiment for the city's redevelopment agency, the Centre City Development Corporation. It was the first time the agency had actively sought more than one developer for a large parcel. It approved a plan calling for seven architects to design six separate housing projects in a little more than one block.,However, with vacancy rates soaring and the area in a general recession in the mid-90's the agency couldn't find builders able to finance large projects downtown.,''We wanted to hit home runs during the recession with big projects, and it just wasn't going to happen,'' said Peter Q. Davis, chairman of the agency's board. ''So we had to go for singles.'',''Conventional wisdom,'' said Michael Stepner, a longtime city planner who is now dean of the New School of Architecture here,  explaining the redevelopment agency's yearning to tackle big projects, ''was that the only way to get something done was to take over an entire block and find one developer.'',To help spur the development of Little Italy, the agency offered developers discounts on city-owned land and it financed off-site improvements, including sidewalks.,Some local residents initially criticized the modern designs for not addressing the heritage of Little Italy, a community where Italian immigrants first settled at the turn of the century. But the architects argued that the area's roots were more closely linked to the fishing fleet, which was once based at the foot of the neighborhood.,''The last place I wanted to look for inspiration was Rome,'' said Ted Smith, one of the architects. ''I think the history of the area was smaller buildings oriented to the waterfront.'',Mr. Smith and his partner, Lloyd Russell, designed the Merrimac Building, a three-story work-living loft project on a 5,000-square-foot lot around the corner from Kettner Row. It also features a sharp box style, narrow spaces and tall windows.,Lofts of about 1,100 square feet in the Merrimac rent for $700 to $800 a month.,''They rented as soon as we put the sign out,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We could have built 50 and they would have rented.'',The tenants are primarily artists, architects and graphic designers who, like Mr. Smith, live and work in the building.,''Our interest as architects is to make spaces that are fun,'' Mr. Smith said,  ''things that typically the market doesn't pay for.'',BOTH Kettner Row and the Merrimac have won state and national design awards and praise from fellow architects. In 1998 an American Institute of Architects awards jury praised the new downtown residential developments as ''bold'' and ''energetic.'',''These designs are quite innovative,'' said Steven Ehrlich, a member of the jury panel and the principal in a Los Angeles architectural firm that bears his name. ''San Diego is on the cutting edge of multifamily residential urban design.'',The projects and others like them provide evidence that ''you can build to lower densities than is the practice and still make money,'' said Rob Wellington Quigley, an architect who has worked on several downtown projects. After several ''grim'' years, downtown is ''coming alive,'' he added.,Industry analysts say downtown is in the midst of a renaissance. With no large projects built in the last five years, the average resale price of condominiums downtown went from $248,000 to $401,000, according to Market Profiles of San Diego, a research firm.,Development of the Gaslamp Quarter,  with nightclubs and restaurants, helped bring new vibrancy to downtown's nightlife. A trolley system that began in 1981 links downtown to outlying areas, including the United States-Mexico border.,The city has done ''an extraordinary job'' redeveloping its downtown, ''particularly because they saw downtown as part of a regional complex,'' said Peter Calthorpe, an architect based in northern California who is a frequent lecturer on urban design issues.,In 1997 the first large supermarket opened downtown and last November voters approved a new hotel and baseball stadium complex for the southeastern corner of downtown. It will be home for the San Diego Padres.,''The decision to live downtown is much easier today than it was even five years ago,'' said Peter Reeb, a real estate analyst.,Real estate analysts talk about a phenomenon similar to ''a switch being flipped'' downtown, in terms of builder interest in developing residential units. In five years, the price of land in Little Italy has jumped from $25 to $75 a square foot, Mr. Smith said.,Mr. Segal has four downtown projects either under construction or approved by the city. One calls for one of the city's oldest taverns, the Waterfront bar in Little Italy, to be incorporated into a loft project.,All of Mr. Segal's new projects -- except for a three-unit development that will include his own residence -- are designed to rent. The vacancy rate for downtown rental units 2.3 percent, according to the San Diego County Apartment Association.,''The time's right for rentals; all the moons are aligned,'' Mr. Segal said.,Mr. Davis of the redevelopment agency said downtown was entering a new era in residential development.,''In the first 22 years of redevelopment we did 4,000 residential units, and we'll probably do 4,000 in the next five years,'' Mr. Davis said.,His agency is now reverting to its old strategy, once again looking for developers willing to take over an entire block.,''Now there seems to be a ton of developers willing to take on a full block,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Right now we're filling up a lot of residential needs and we're doing it with larger projects.'',Last year, his agency put out a request for proposals to redevelop 12 sites in the waterfront Marina District, the southwest corner of downtown near the San Diego Convention Center. A few years ago such a an announcement would have attracted little attention. This year more than 30 proposals were received.,Eventually, the redevelopment agency chose eight commercial and residential plans including several covering entire blocks. The projects, which are expected to be completed over the next three years, will add 1,157 apartments and for-sale units to the existing 7,900 units downtown, according to Market Profiles of San Diego.",KEVIN BRASS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Thinking Small in San Diego's Little Italy Enclave,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/thinking-small-in-san-diego-s-little-italy-enclave.html

"SURE, he was ''the greatest''  by all accounts, although he would be the first to tell you so. And he was, in his words, ''the most powerfulest.'' And ''the baddest.'' And ''the most superior.'' And ''the fastest thing on two feet.'' And the three-time ''champion of the world -- the whole world.'' And ''the prettiest thing that ever lived.'' And ''the boss.'' And. And. And.,So goes the documented rodomontade. But where's the play?,''And I'm still the greatest,'' proclaims the actor Charles Brown, playing Muhammad Ali (''Present Day,'' eight years after his last fight), as he takes to the stage of the Crossroads Theater Company here. If it is indeed the present day, as the program states, he is 57, although the play ''Ali'' was first produced in 1992 for one actor, Geoffrey C. Ewing, who played the older and evoked the younger, when the world called him Cassius Marcellus Clay. That play was set in 1989.,In an expansion by the same authors, Mr. Ewing and Graydon Royce, from 80 minutes to 120, ''Ali'' has gained, well, 40 minutes -- and one actor, Lloyd Goodman, to play Ali in his Early Years. The evocation was preferable to the representation, and seven years ago the evening was swifter.,Yet even then, ''Ali'' was a series of disjointed sound bites for the stage -- a snippet from a news conference here, a transcript from a lecture there. Indeed, it is a four-year lecture tour of community centers and colleges that frames the non-play. Ali (Present Day) slurringly says, ''Just got this Parkinson's syndrome.'' And he hopes he's getting ''wiser instead of worser.'',Woodie King Jr.'s staging, curiously static and inapt, goes for animation in rudimentary ways. Mr. Goodman shadowboxes, punches the air, skips rope, lurches into a victory dance and runs, yes, like a butterfly, making it breathlessly clear that the young actor is capable of wearing out an audience long before he will exhaust himself. For all that, ''Ali'' just sits there.,Flanked by lighting towers and two screens (see Joe Frazier; see Larry Holmes), the Crossroads set, by Felix E. Cochren, represents a ring, a locker room, a training room. Crowds roar. Bells clang.,But it's only a lulling lecture-demonstration and diatribe, replete with visual aids. Ali (Present Day) talks of his changed ''relationship with America,'' referring to his Muslim association with Malcolm X, of his divorce, alimony, his Vietnam War protest that virtually branded him as an enemy of the people, landing him on the F.B.I.'s and C.I.A.'s lists of subversives.,The juxtaposition of an unstoppable youth and an ailing man remains a concept on paper. The man's politics are simplified. The persona, the poetry and the prophecy are all hearsay. Promising no rhetoric, yet delivering it, Ali (Present Day) winds up saying, out of nowhere: ''The only thing that matters is that we love and get love in return. Everything else is just an illusion.'' But then he says, ''I'm going to stop now,'' and since he makes good on that promise, who's to complain?,Just this month, the form and face of Muhammad Ali (Early Years) graced a commemorative stamp and a box of Wheaties. In 1977, he starred in a movie (''The Greatest''). While David Remnick, in his highly praised biography, ''King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of the American Hero'' (Random House, 1998), affirmed with words ''the way a gangly kid from Louisville managed to become one of the most electric of American characters, a molder of his age and a reflection of it,'' the authors of ''Ali'' settle for shapelessness and platitudes.,''Maybe someday, somebody'll write a play about me,'' says Ali (Early Years).

"IT is 1991, the dawning of perestroika. In Havana, the Pan American Games are all the rage, but inside a once-luxurious house in the Cuban countryside, two sisters, Maria Celia and Sofia, are under surveillance, their possessions reduced to a precious few. Even lipstick and deodorant are running out. But it's better than a prison cell. ''At least here, we can walk all the way from the kitchen to the living room,'' Maria Celia says.,An out-of-tune piano, representing the corrosion of a family legacy, is the centerpiece of a living room in which a chandelier, a candelabra and a few paintings evoke an elegance long gone.,In ''Two Sisters and a Piano,'' which first appeared in a 1996 series of short plays at the McCarter Theater here, the playwright Nilo Cruz is telling two newly expanded love stories: one involving the married Maria Celia and her oppressor, Lieutenant Portuondo; the other pairing the sexually famished Sofia with a piano-tuner, Victor Manuel.,Even though Mr. Cruz's writing is informed by the bitterness and futility of Cuba's centurylong revolution that went nowhere and the paradox of a new dictatorship spawned by rebels who changed their causes, his overly extended, oddly uneventful work is truer to the true-romance genre of the serialization or mini-series kind than to theater of passion and purpose.,The coded love letters that Maria Celia, a best-selling novelist who protested too much, is supposed to be receiving from the freed husband she loves are being seized and opened by the militia. But the leader of the guards has fallen in love with her. A torrid scene between them follows, then a battle of ideological inevitability -- all contrived. A sister-to-sister face-off, promising a cathartic change, produces a momentary confrontational lift but no dramatic heft.,Lyrical flights, not political fervor or involving dramatic force, are Mr. Cruz's offering to the stage. Talk of a ''new map of the world'' is all talk, but Mr. Cruz's gift for phrase-making is lovely. His play is one of this year's three winners of grants from the Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays, which bring $30,000 to the theater and $10,000 to the author. (One of the other two is ''Lost Creek Township,'' by Charlotte A. Gibson, scheduled in April at the Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick.),It is easy to see why the McCarter's artistic director, Emily Mann, goes for Mr. Cruz's work. Even though Ms. Mann champions the theater of issues, it is the regard for language, the healing power of words, that is the essence of this theater's repertory.,It is no accident that Maria Celia writes. She represents the tenacity of a revolutionary spirit, while the playwright attempts to explore the pointlessness of it. Holding on to her purity of purpose, she still talks of going on a hunger strike at the play's end, knowing there is no place for her ''out there.'',Three of the performances serve the play. Gary Perez makes a charming Victor; Bobby Cannavale an ardent, insistent lieutenant, and Ivonne Coll a resigned, no-nonsense Maria Celia. Marissa Chibas plays the weaker sister; one wonders whether Sofia is most a victim of performance, writing or direction.,Yet neither the actors nor the director, Brian Kulick, provide vital embellishment, thrust or theatrical sustenance.,But wait. The McCarter's stage design -- set by Mark Wendland, lighting by Mimi Jordan Sherin -- displays a revealing series of ravishing, then startling metaphors. As gulls ascend to snow-white clouds and iridescent blue skies, you can hear the airy stage breathe. Then walls, shutters, screens and paintings descend, enclosing a home.  Plants fill the stage in an anticipation of sensuality. All at once, the visual aspects of the production represent freeing and confinement, the peacefulness of past and of possibility, and the oppressiveness of the present.,Did you ever go to a play to look at stage pictures and to capture words dancing with grace, without caring what the whole thing is supposed to be about?,TWO SISTERS AND A PIANO,McCarter Theater,91 University Place, Princeton,Through next Sunday.

"THE woman at the first preview was surprised.,''It's good,'' she told a friend. ''I thought I would hate it. I had dinner with some people, and they said, 'What are you seeing?' I told them 'Annie Oakley' and they said, 'Why?' '',The answer to that question is Bernadette Peters, who stars in the revival of Irving Berlin's ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' opening on Thursday at the Marquis Theater on Broadway.,Not that it should bother Barry and Fran Weissler, the show's producers, that the woman called the show by the name of its lead character; they are, after all, the team that took the best choreography Tony nomination for their 1994 revival of ''Grease!'' and turned it into ''Best Dancing'' in the show's ads, figuring that tourists wouldn't know what ''choreography'' meant.,The preview-goer actually put her finger on the conundrum that is the current production of ''Annie Get Your Gun.'' It is two shows, really. The first is the Annie Oakley show, in which Bernadette Peters gets to sing classic Irving Berlin while giving the character an entirely new spin: shunning Ethel Merman's Mack truck approach, she has reconceived the role in the vein of Eliza Doolittle, a backwoods hick, who, with a great deal of sweetness and spunk, slowly but surely learns everything she needs to know to get her man, Frank Butler, played by Tom Wopat.,When the show tried out in Washington in early January, the critic Lloyd Rose wrote in The Washington Post, ''For anyone who cares about the American musical theater, the chance to see Peters in this role is reason enough to see the show.'',The second show is the rest of ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' directed by Graciela Daniele and choreographed by her and Jeff Calhoun, which Ms. Rose and Variety dismissed. The show's book, written originally by Herbert and Dorothy Fields, with its plethora of Indian jokes, is offensive by today's standards. So, the Weisslers hired the writer Peter Stone to revise and update it, though he has managed to leave such non-Indian gems intact as Annie shifting her cleavage around and saying, ''I'll show him a thing or two.'',In this era of big-budget Broadway spectacles, which celebrate scenery and animals, Ms. Peters is something of an anachronism. A genuine musical-theater star, she can either sit around and wait for a role in a new Stephen Sondheim musical (she is considered by many to be the premier interpreter of his work) or else be the diamond in a rough revival setting just for the chance to do the job she was trained for.,Either way, she has a built-in audience rooting for her. Working since the age of 3 1/2, she developed her quirky, personal style during the 60's, when Broadway started its attenuated swan dive as the world turned to rock-and-roll.,She stayed her course, winning a Theater World citation for her performance in ''George M!,'' starring Joel Grey, and a Drama Desk Award for ''Dames at Sea'' Off Broadway. She was nominated for a Tony Award for the 1971 revival of ''On the Town'' and for Jerry Herman's ''Mack and Mabel.'' She won a Tony as best actress in a musical for Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''Song and Dance'' in 1986 and was also nominated for Mr. Sondheim's ''Sunday in the Park With George.'',When the theater has hit its fallow periods, she has never had a problem keeping busy: besides countless television appearances, everything from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to ''Fall From Grace,'' in which she played Tammy Faye Bakker to Kevin Spacey's Jim Bakker, she has appeared steadily in films, and won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in ''Pennies From Heaven.'' After making her Carnegie Hall debut in 1996, she has traveled internationally with her concert program, which will be broadcast on PBS in August. But when the theater does come through, she comes back.,''I know how much the industry has changed,'' she says, drinking tea one evening before ''Annie Get Your Gun'' previews are to begin. She is at the Broadway Grill at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, where theater memorabilia is displayed in glass cases, including a shirt she wore in the flop Neil Simon musical, ''The Goodbye Girl.'' She peers at it. ''My biggest hit,'' she murmurs, turning away.,''Broadway is changing and the roles aren't there because of that,'' she goes on. ''The shows are different, grander, and with an operatic sing-talking. Singing the script just isn't my favorite. With 'Annie,' I saw a wonderful character there. She says what's on her mind and doesn't hold anything back, which is kind of refreshing. I also thought, 'Here comes a show in these strange times we live in that are so negative that it might be nice to do something looking up, positive. Maybe it's time to give people a lift.' Revivals used to be a walk down memory lane instead of a new show unfolding in front of you. But since revivals are approached that way now, this one piqued my interest.'',AT 51, Ms. Peters is a remarkable-looking woman. Her trademark pale skin is without lines, her waist is still tiny and this day, at least, her wild hair is at peace. She seems to retain the untouched quality of a child, a tranquillity, perhaps, left from the days when her mother, Marguerite Lazzara, was in charge. A would-be actress herself who used the name Marge Peters, she succeeded in getting her 5-year-old daughter onto ''The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour,'' where she imitated Sophie Tucker. Also at 5, she won $800 on ''Name That Tune.'' The song she missed on? ''Pistol Packin' Mama.'',It seems somehow indelicate to bring that up now that she is playing one. Though Ms. Peters is more than willing to chat about certain things -- Michael Wittenberg, her husband of two and a half years, who is an investment adviser; which spas give a great massage; and what a fabulous job her friend Joel Grey has done decorating her dressing room -- she is skittish about even the most basic interview questions.,When asked, ''How would you describe yourself?'' she answers: ''I can't describe myself. Do I have to?'',It soon becomes clear why, as Richard Jay Alexander, the director of her concerts, says, ''Everyone loves her but they don't know her.'' Because in her own charming, disarming way, she sees to it.,''There's tremendous depth to Bernadette but it takes time,'' Mr. Alexander says. ''She started so young, and she had the same manager for 27 years, which helped her through the treachery of Hollywood and gave her a classy career, but she was taught to be obedient. She doesn't challenge people until they have a certain kind of relationship. She's enormously deep-feeling and emotional. I've seen outbursts, not the kind you get from Al Pacino, but she makes it clear if there's something she's unhappy with. Nothing is an accident with Bernadette. It's all very deeply thought. I've worked with a lot of people who show up and say, 'I'm here.' She studies hard. She's a director's dream.'',What she is concentrating on now is keeping well. While the flu sweeps New York, she is gobbling Wellness Formula capsules, firm in her intent to play all eight shows a week every week for the year's duration of her contract. Except for matinee days, she takes a voice lesson every day she performs. She is prepared for the hard work of carrying a Broadway show, and says she welcomes it. That does mean, however, that she will not be able to tour her concert, the second act of which is entirely Sondheim. She smiles. ''I was telling Steve, 'I'm really going to miss hearing your lyrics, what you have to say.' '',Being able to sing Irving Berlin is certainly a pleasure, but the combination of Ms. Peters and Mr. Sondheim is guaranteed magic. What makes their connection so powerful? She fidgets. ''I hate talking about people,'' she says. ''I feel I'm invading their privacy.'' But this is about the songs he writes, which she sings. Everyone hears them. She sighs. ''I think his soul, his songs have a lot to say about somebody,'' she finally says. ''When he writes a song, he totally takes on a topic and thoroughly gets into it and it just speaks to me. I think Steve is a real softie, really. Plus intelligent, smart, clever. He loves words and knows how to put them together. But he has a lovely sensitive heart he's probably protecting.'',As does she. Growing up in Ozone Park, Queens, with her eye on Broadway, Ms. Peters found she could not even get into the chorus. Standing all of 5 feet 2 with her mass of hair and distracting bosom, she looked nothing like the tall, tensile dancers who form the line. During her high school years at the Quintano School for Young Professionals in Manhattan, where Gregory Hines was a year ahead of her, she says she was in pain:,''When you're a teen-ager and are supposed to look like Twiggy and you don't, you feel everything is wrong about you. When I was a teen-ager, Twiggy was it -- straight hair, really skinny, no breasts. I was trying desperately to blend in and be normal, but that doesn't allow creativity to come out. Finally, one summer I was fighting my hair going curly, I was hot, I thought, 'The hell with it.' And it was then I started working. Once I accepted that about myself, it allowed me to come forward.'' She smiles, just a touch ruefully. ''Even now, some directors say to me, 'What can we do with your hair?' '',The two people who helped her most, she says, were David LeGrant, her first acting teacher, and her vocal coach, Jim Gregory. ''David said, 'There is only one of you in the world, so you must be the best you you can be. And Jim opened a whole creative world for me with singing.'',Though her mother, who died in 1982, had always pushed her, Ms. Peters insists she never felt the pressure was too much. ''We had a deal that I could stop anytime I wanted,'' she says. ''I really didn't work a lot as a kid. I would stand in a row for an orange juice commercial and all the other kids were smiling for no reason, so I didn't. I'm lucky I never became a success as a kid. I didn't have to make a success twice. As a kid, it was more like a hobby, getting my chops, learning the ropes, paying my dues at a young age.'',Indeed, when she gathers with the cast at one of the final ''Annie Get Your Gun'' rehearsals before previews begin in New York, Ms. Peters seems the calmest person in the room. She is dressed in jeans, cowboy boots, a white camisole top and flannel shirt. She re-applies her lipstick often and wears wire-rimmed glasses to read. The task at hand is to polish the production number ''I Got the Sun in the Morning.'' If someone walked into the room and didn't know who the star was, the choice would be obvious: she is the smallest, the most quiet and focused. While the dancers laugh and talk, she marshals her energy.,''I need Bernadette and the four boys,'' Mr. Calhoun announces, and they walk to the center of the room. They review some steps, including the finale when two of the men lift her and set her on their shoulders. After a run-through, one of them looks alarmed. ''Are you O.K.?'' he asks earnestly, touching her upper arm. ''I was digging a little bit.'' She smiles and folds her hand around his protectively, to reassure him.,They do the number again. And again. Ms. Peters and the chorus boys smile dazzlingly at one another, as if they've got a secret, and maybe they do. As the star, she makes them look better; as her frame, they keep her company. Their mutual delight in dancing can convince anyone that every night is Saturday night and life is nothing more than a jubilant variety show.,As the song rises to its end, Ms. Peters is swept onto the men's shoulders, skin radiant, eyes shining, her arms up and open in musical-comedy triumph. There is absolutely no one else in the world who can fit so comfortably in such a particular seat, emitting such a particular joy.,Bull's-eye.",ALEX WITCHEL,"FEB. 28, 1999","THEATER; A True Star, Looking For Places to Shine",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/theater/theater-a-true-star-looking-for-places-to-shine.html
"THERE is an expectant murmur in the room as the cast and crew gather in Greenwich Village on the first morning of rehearsals for ''Annie Get Your Gun.'' Perched on the edges of their metal folding chairs are the people who will spend the next 17 weeks bringing this classic 1946 Irving Berlin musical back to Broadway: Bernadette Peters, the star who plays the title role of Annie Oakley; Graciela Daniele, the show's director and co-choreographer; Tony Walton, the set designer; William Ivey Long, the costume designer; as well as the 34 other members of the cast and many technical staffers.,At the front of the expansive rehearsal studio, looking typically coiffed and fashionable, stand Fran and Barry Weissler, the mama and papa of this production, the producers. ''Look at all the people here,'' Ms. Weissler says, smiling. ''And we're paying them.'',The quip was striking because, in the 16 years that the Weisslers have produced on Broadway, they have earned a reputation for being -- among other things -- cheap. At last year's televised Tony Awards, Rosie O'Donnell joked during a commercial break that the Weisslers are ''the cheapest people in the free world.'',''They're good sports,'' Ms. O'Donnell said subsequently. ''You can tease them and they'll invite you to dinner.'',Friends and colleagues of the Weisslers say this ability to laugh at themselves has come to the husband-and-wife producing team with time. The couple that started out driving their acting company around to parochial schools in the Northeast in a station wagon and U-Haul have, over the last several years, presented Broadway revivals of ''Gypsy'' with Tyne Daly, ''My Fair Lady'' with Richard Chamberlain and Melissa Errico, and ''Grease!'' with Ms. O'Donnell.,Now, with the success of ''Chicago'' -- their Broadway revival that won six Tonys two years ago and has seven companies around the world as well as two in rehearsal for Sweden and the Netherlands -- the Weisslers have hit the jackpot, becoming international producers and earning not only millions of dollars but even the grudging respect of some of their peers.,''It gave them an artistic credibility they were looking for,'' said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the theater-owning Nederlander Organization.,As a result, the Weisslers seem to have entered the current theater season with increasing confidence, mounting the revised ''Annie Get Your Gun'' (which opens on Thursday at the Marquis, a Nederlander theater) and moving Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed comic play, ''This Is Our Youth,'' to a commercial run Off Broadway at the Douglas Fairbanks.,''It's softening them a lot,'' said Ms. Errico, who played Eliza Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady.''  ''They're not hungry in the same way anymore.'',Not everyone would agree. The Weisslers are still lightning rods in the theater business, and people apparently either love them or hate them. Those in the latter category say the Weisslers are lowbrow and litigious and bully their employees. In dismissing the couple on artistic grounds, their critics say the Weisslers prefer to play it safe with revivals rather than develop productions from scratch. According to this argument, the work on ''Chicago'' had already been done for the 1996 production in the Encores concert musicals series at City Center; the Weisslers simply moved the show to Broadway more or less intact.,In interviews with many people in the theater industry, no one would speak critically of the Weisslers on the record. The theater world is a small one, and those who have clashed with the Weisslers -- be they actors, directors, investors or potential co-producers -- refuse to be quoted by name, given the possibility that they may work with the couple in the future.,IN response to some of the criticisms, Mr. Weissler said in a recent interview: ''Of course I care what my colleagues think of me. But I won't live with the obsession that I want to be loved by all these people. I want them to acknowledge Fran's and my work, but if they don't, I'll go it alone.,''Being frugal gave us a reputation for being tight,'' he added. ''It's just not true. We're not profligate. We're trained in the theater, so we put a value on things. We say: 'This is what we believe we can spend on this. Can you do it? If not, we'll go somewhere else.' '',Those who think well of the Weisslers suggest that some of the criticism surrounding them is sour grapes because they are self-made and have become multi-millionaires with ''Chicago.'',The Weisslers ''bring in their shows on budget and their shows make money, which is practically unheard of in this business,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, who has co-produced several shows with them.,''There's a lot of Schadenfreude in this business and a resentment of success.'' Mr. Landesman said.,Christopher Plummer, who starred in the Weisslers' first Broadway production, ''Othello,'' in 1982, said: ''Everybody talks about how mean they are. I think all of us have been talking about producers like that since Day One. They've never been mean to me.'',Both critics and fans of the Weisslers agree that they have successfully bucked the tide by producing the old-fashioned way, frequently in collaboration with other investors, at a time when commercial Broadway theater is moving into the hands of corporate titans like Disney. They also say the Weisslers are strong personalities, a dying breed on Broadway.,''One of the things this business is missing is the roguish impresario characters,'' said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade organization on whose executive board Mr. Weissler sits. ''Barry and Fran are certainly larger than life and the theater needs larger-than-life personalities.'',Ms. Weissler -- Fran to most -- looks considerably younger than her 70 years in her Escada coral and lime-green outfits, pear-shaped diamond ring and manicured nails. She is the matriarch of the operation. Rather than simply employing people, she adopts them, taking an interest -- some might say meddling -- in their personal lives.,''Fran likes to know what you eat, where you bought your earrings, who you're in love with,'' Ms. Errico said.,Then there is Mr. Weissler, 60, who is more formal than his wife, though his friends say he has a shrewd sense of humor. Mr. Weissler handles the business side of their company, National Artists Management, affectionately dismissing his wife as someone who would give the store away. ''If you leave it to her, she just says yes to everything,'' he said. The two acknowledge that they often disagree (he prevailed in wanting to do ''Fiddler on the Roof'' when she didn't; she prevailed in wanting to do ''Gypsy'' when he didn't; both shows won Tonys for best revival).,Some say the Weisslers have perfected a good-cop, bad-cop dichotomy that belies their coordinated teamwork. While Ms. Weissler may defer financial questions with, ''That's Barry's department,'' they say, she is not a novice about money.,At the same time, people in the industry maintain, it is typically Mr. Weissler's contentiousness that leads the couple into court.,In 1991, for example, the Weisslers' company filed a $4 million arbitration claim against Anthony Quinn for allegedly concealing a heart condition that later invalidated insurance coverage for the aborted 1989 national tour of the Lee Blessing play ''A Walk in the Woods,'' when the actor was unable to perform. In their claim for breach of contract and fraud, the Weisslers said they would not have produced the play if they had known that Mr. Quinn ''suffered from significant cardiac illness.'' They were awarded $450,000. Mr. Quinn said he had not known he suffered from angina when he started working on the play.,In 1983, Vinnette Carroll, who created and directed the Weisslers' production of ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' charged them with failing to pay royalties. The case was settled out of court.,The Weisslers are still in litigation over their insurance on ''Busker Alley,'' the show that closed on the road in 1995 because the star, Tommy Tune, fractured his foot.,Mr. Weissler said that such disputes come with the territory. ''I'm in business,'' he said. ''We do hundreds of millions of dollars a year. There are bound to be legal ramifications.'',Some people who have worked with the Weisslers argue that the tenacity that makes the producers distasteful to some in the industry is also the secret to their success. ''They're tough,'' said Walter Bobbie, the director of ''Chicago.'' ''Anybody has to be to do this.'',It is the Weisslers' early experiences in trying to build their business that seem to inform everything they do to this day. They met in 1963, soon after Mr. Weissler had started his theater troupe, the National Shakespeare Company, in New Jersey. Fran Weller spent one day working in the box office in West Orange, N.J., to fill in for a sick friend. The couple were married a year and a half later.,Asked what originally attracted her to her second husband (she has two children by her first and four grandchildren), Ms. Weissler said that she surprised herself by falling for a short man with no money and small hands. ''He was difficult, volatile, funny, romantic,'' she added. ''He was a combination of a lot of things I hadn't had before.'',Mr. Weissler was typically more circumspect. Speaking of their age difference, he said: ''I love to be taken care of. We're just your average husband and wife.'',Both Ms. Weissler, who grew up in a suburb of Boston, and Mr. Weissler, who grew up in Jersey City, are keenly aware of how far they have come since those rough beginnings. So much so that even though they appear to embrace the accouterments of success -- a spacious apartment on Central Park West, elegant dinners out on the town with prominent people -- they can still be made giddy by their good fortune.,They also guard it fiercely, knowing that -- given the perilous risks of producing -- it could slip away from them at any time.,''We closed 'Applause' out of town,'' Ms. Weissler said, ''and 'Busker Alley' went down the toilet; thank God we had 'Grease!' on the road.,''Then 'Chicago' happened. Everybody forgets what came before, and let them forget it. You're as good as your last show. It comes with the territory. You want to go to Broadway, you want to play with the big guys, you can't complain about it.'',Some say that wanting to play with the big guys is a large part of what makes the Weisslers so driven. ''There is the perception among the initiated that they are outsiders, and I think they have felt that,'' Mr. Landesman said. ''I don't think it is ever going to go away because they have labored so long without what they have felt to be general acceptance, always feeling they have to work twice as hard.'',To the degree that it is possible, the Weisslers have insulated themselves against some of the vagaries of the business by producing revivals that are more likely to appeal to a Broadway audience and its tourists; by developing road companies that can be an additional source of revenue; by building a full-time operation -- including marketing, casting and development -- that is constantly at work on future projects.,From choosing costumes to editing programs to traveling out to their road companies to watching rehearsals, the Weisslers are all over their productions. ''Fran will go to auditions for every chorus person that goes into a show,'' said Howie Cherpakov, the Weisslers' associate casting director.,Some of those who work with them say the producers take pride in developing talent and thereby inspire loyalty. ''They've been very good to me,'' said Mr. Cherpakov, who started out as an intern in 1995.,At the same time, others say the couple have trouble keeping employees because they berate them. ''If you go to any production office, virtually everyone there has worked for the Weisslers,'' said the owner of a theater outside New York City who insisted on anonymity. ''It's a revolving door.'',Ms. Weissler disagrees. ''Sometimes,'' she said, ''if you have great assistants, they want to go further, but most of the major people have stayed with us.'',The Weisslers are legendary for negotiating over the last sequin and both acknowledge that they believe in finding ways to produce for less.,While musicals can cost more than $10 million these days, ''Annie Get Your Gun'' is expected to cost about $6 million. ''They set out to do the best they can for the least amount of money for the most amount of profit,'' Ms. O'Donnell said. ''And that's what anyone in business tries to do.'',Some Broadway competitors say the Weisslers save money at the expense of their productions and that their frugality is why, for example,  ''Chicago,'' at about $3 million, was the show for them.,In a business that is notorious for losing money, the Weisslers maintain that their approach has paid off and that of the 20 shows they have produced since 1983, they have made a profit on 14. The figures cannot be confirmed because National Artists Management is privately owned.,AS to whether they play it safe artistically, the Weisslers counter with several examples, including ''Falsettos,'' ''Busker Alley'' and ''Cornelia.'' ''Falsettos,'' the musical by William Finn involving gay characters, was a gamble for them on Broadway, where it received positive reviews and two Tonys; although it is true that the show had been produced before in two parts and the Weisslers simply combined them into one. ''Busker Alley'' would have been a new Broadway production had it traveled that far. Press reports at the time suggested that Mr. Tune's foot fracture was an excuse to close a troubled show out of town, where reviews had not been that favorable. ''Cornelia,'' a new play about the second wife of George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, had been scheduled to arrive on Broadway this season, directed by Jerry Zaks, but has been put off to next season. The Weisslers said they have had difficulty casting the production, written by Mark Victor Olsen, a first-time playwright.,In any event, the Weisslers say, revival should not be a dirty word. ''Why is reviving 'Annie Get Your Gun' any less noble than doing 'Macbeth'?'' Ms. Weissler asked. ''What is opera? What is ballet? How great it is to preserve the classics and make them new.'',But no matter what the criticism of the Weisslers, there is a mantra that people throughout the business recite: They get their shows up and keep them running.,''Whatever they are or aren't,'' asserted Jay Binder, a casting director who said he had been dismissed by Ms. Weissler on three separate occasions, ''they've delivered.''",ROBIN POGREBIN,"FEB. 28, 1999","THEATER; A Team That Produces Hits, and Mixed Feelings",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/theater/theater-a-team-that-produces-hits-and-mixed-feelings.html
"WORKING lightly, surely and always in sync, the playwright Paula Vogel, the director Joe Mantello, the star Swoosie Kurtz and a dream supporting cast are cheering up a mostly dreary season with ''The Mineola Twins,'' the exhilarating Roundabout Theater Company entertainment now at the Laura Pels Theater.,There is such an abundance of theatrical life on view in the production that it comes as a shock when, at the curtain call, only five people show up. Even though no attempt has been made to hide the fact that each of the three women in the cast plays two roles and their two male colleagues play many more, this post-performance reminder is a surprise.,Several of the role transformations take place onstage, front and center, in sequences choreographed in syncopated dance movements: the performer, attended by two genie-like dressers, switches into a different costume, wig and sometimes sexual identity, while never missing a step. The effect is to give ''The Mineola Twins'' a festive air, celebrating the joys of theatrical illusion even as they are cheerily unmasked.,This is also the method of Ms. Vogel's play, which prompts the audience to laugh, occasionally from its belly, at manners and attitudes she doesn't find funny at all.,Don't fret that the show isn't easily categorized. The playwright, who received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for her elegiacal ''How I Learned to Drive,'' is here dealing in broad satire that is often hilarious just because of the intense, go-for-broke way in which it demolishes familiar targets.,''The Mineola Twins,'' Ms. Vogel's overview of nearly 40 years in the social history of American women, touches down to check the temper of the times in the Eisenhower, Nixon and Bush Administrations. Everything is seen from the perspective of a pair of furiously demented variations on that icon of a doll, Barbie. Myrna and Myra, conceived at the same moment of bliss, are identical in every respect except for what Myrna, the ''good'' sister, refers to as the development in ''the chestal region.'' As her first suitor notes, Myrna is ''stacked.'',The ''bad'' sister, Myra, sometimes described as ''the whore of Babylon'' (remember, this takes place on Long Island), is flat as a pancake.,When first met, the teen-age Myrna, her chestal region a sight gag when the audience sees her in profile, works at a Mineola luncheonette. Her only wish (other than winning the Homemakers of America Senior Award) is to marry Mr. Right, move to Levittown and raise a family. Mr. Right is Jim, a virginal ''older'' man (in his early 20's) who is advising the Ford Motor Company how to sell young buyers on the company's still top-secret and unnamed revolutionary new automobile.,Myra has no single boyfriend. She prefers to take her boyfriends in groups, like the first-string squad of the Mineola football team. She spends her time getting suspended from Mineola High and, when she isn't working as a cocktail waitress in what Myrna calls ''a roadside tavern of ill repute,'' she hangs out in Greenwich Village, where women wear pants.,Though the sisters are bound in a psychic union that allows each to invade the other's mind, they profoundly loathe each other. No matter that each eventually leaves Mineola on a different path, their destinies remain locked as they deal with separate but parallel tragedies. Apparently, not even unequal bra sizes can break the bond of sisterhood.,Ms. Vogel has been quoted as saying that ''The Mineola Twins'' is intended as a metaphor for the division between America's political right and left. Yet the ferocity of the love-hate relationship between Myra and Myrna seems far more complicated and ambiguous than that. The politics of the play are fairly rudimentary. The manner in which the show is performed is the thing, and it's an upper.,Ms. Kurtz seems never to stop working in television and movies, but it's a long time since we have had the opportunity to see the kind of bravura comic theatrical performance she gives here as the Mineola twins. She is priceless, an early spring tonic, whether playing Myrna as Sandra Dee, Myrna as the frosty, embittered Great Neck homemaker, or the older Myrna, author of ''Profiles in Chastity'' and a hugely popular, rabidly right-wing talk show host. It is this Myrna, outspoken foe of multiculturalism, birth control and homosexuality, whose on-air voice sounds a little bit like that of Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the hugely popular, real-life radio talk show host.,But then Ms. Kurtz is equally spectacular as Myra, who initially suggests Linda Blair in combat with the exorcist. Poor Myra. During the chaos of the Vietnam years, she serves time for bank robbery, but later pulls herself together to settle down with Sarah, her significant other, and to head the Long Island branch of Planned Parenthood.,It seems to be no accident that each sister is raising a fatherless son who rebels against his mother and seeks guidance from the aunt whose name his mother can scarcely bear to mention. In the dual role of the sons is Mandy Siegfried, seen earlier this season in ''Stupid Kids,'' an enchanting young actress who manages to play two very different teen-age boys without for a minute hiding her own identity. It is not that she looks like a girl playing a boy (she doesn't), but that she acts the characters. Had she simply impersonated them, she would have called attention to herself.,The show's third star performance is that of the comedienne Mo Gaffney, a hearty woman who appears first as Myrna's boyfriend, Jim, the fleshy, foolish man who hitches his wagon to the success of the Edsel and allows himself to be deflowered by Myra. Later, after a triumphant onstage transformation, she appears as Myra's lover, Sarah. As much as anyone else in ''The Mineola Twins,'' Ms. Gaffney exemplifies the playfulness of a production in which cross-dressing, though a political statement, is also legitimately funny.,Daniel Sherman, a big stalwart fellow, and Jimmy Holder, his shorter, slighter sidekick, play their multiple nonspeaking roles as if they were spaced out floorwalkers ever willing to give their help, which is often expressed in dance. They play, among other types, dressers, stagehands, F.B.I. agents ''dressed like Mormon missionaries,'' and the hospital orderlies who attend Myrna before her shock treatments. A highlight: the scene in which the temporarily mad Myrna somehow loosens her restraints to dance an impromptu adagio, her straitjacket flaps flying so gracefully that the orderlies seem tempted to join in.,It is often impossible to tell where the work of the playwright leaves off and that of the director begins. Yet the vision necessary to call forth and  coordinate the many superb contributions by those responsible for the sets, costumes, lighting, musical staging and, especially, the amazing wigs, all would seem to indicate that ''The Mineola Twins'' is the director's show. That is, the work of Joe Mantello, who was also responsible for the memorable stagings of Jon Robin Baitz's ''Mizlansky/Zilinsky or Schmucks'' and Terrence McNally's ''Love! Valour! Compassion!'',Like every director, Mr. Mantello needs a text that has a life and mind to nurture. Forget his productions of Mr. McNally's ''Corpus Christi'' and Neil Simon's ''Proposals.'' When he finds the right material, he knows how to make it look effortless and inevitable, something that had to happen in just the way we behold it. Which is why ''The Mineola Twins'' is so satisfying and so theatrical.,'Captains Courageous',You have to look hard to find any reference to Rudyard Kipling in the program for the Manhattan Theater Club's production of ''Captains Courageous, the Musical.'' It's there, but in very small type on the page that lists the cast members, squeezed between the information about the time in which the show takes place (1928) and the advisory that there will be one 15-minute intermission: ''The novel, 'Captains Courageous,' was written by Rudyard Kipling in 1897.'',There is no mention at all of M-G-M, which produced the film that inspired the show, of the men who wrote that screenplay (John Lee Mahin, Marc Connelly and Dale Van Every), or of Victor Fleming, the film's director. The only credit: ''Based on 'Captains Courageous,' courtesy of Turner Entertainment Co.'' The artists are dead, long live the holders of the copyright!,No big deal, perhaps. What reputation the movie still has is attached to the name of Spencer Tracy, who plays Manuel, the philosophical Portuguese fisherman from New Bedford, who saves the life of a rich boy who falls from an ocean liner and teaches him to be a man. Tracy played the same sort of fisherman far better in ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' but with a Spanish accent.,Why go into all this? I suppose I'm avoiding the question of why the show, for which Frederick Freyer wrote the music and Patrick Cook the book and lyrics, is so determinedly uninteresting and spiritless.,The production, directed by Lynne Meadow, the artistic director of the Manhattan Theater Club, has an attractive, talented cast headed by Treat Williams (Manuel) and Brandon Espinoza (the boy), but nothing else is up to par. The score has the effect of one long, sleep-inducing lullaby. The book might seem predictable even to someone who had never touched Kipling or seen the once-popular Hollywood variation.,Even the set, by the usually stylish Derek McLane, never evokes the sailing vessel where the rotten kid lives and learns for several months, before being returned to his father as a perfect little he-man. The set looks like a large square wooden pier floating off the Grand Banks, but at a permanent rake that indicates it is in the process of sinking.,At one point, we have a brief glimpse of a yardarm with some cloth attached, cinched to look like a furled sail. Here is a sailing vessel without masts, without any perpendiculars, with nothing that reaches toward the sky, which is a constant in a life at sea, unless you have lost your ship and are clinging to a raft.,The set isn't that important, but it represents the failure of the imagination behind the entire endeavor.,THE MINEOLA TWINS -- A bravura performance by Swoosie Kurtz in Paula Vogel's exhilarating satire about women's history, theatrical illusion and sexual identity.,CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS -- Despite a talented cast, the musical sinks.",VINCENT CANBY,"FEB. 28, 1999",THEATER; A Mad History of Women as Told by Twin Barbies,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/theater/theater-a-mad-history-of-women-as-told-by-twin-barbies.html
"YOU don't have to be Italian-American to relate to this play,'' said the producer Lee Pope before last Saturday night's opening performance of ''The Gathering'' at the Schoolhouse here.,Both Ms. Pope's words and the play by Steve Scionti and James Shanta are the epitome of a ''cliche coming true,'' as a lyric by Oscar Hammerstein 2d goes. It is almost as if Mr. Scionti, the play's solo performer, who was born and raised in Middletown, Conn., is a champion of truth in stereotype.,Look to Mr. Scionti's grandfather Angelo Morello's credo: ''You take the good; no matter how bad, everybody has a good. Let's go eat.'',On stage, Mr. Scionti's family gathering is taking place after Angelo Morello's funeral, with the actor leaping back and forth through time, playing eight roles, including his dying grandfather, who was a shoemaker; his own brother, Antonio, five years younger and their father, Sebastiano, a mason and a welder. Among others, count Jerry, the pizza maker; Amadeus, his mother's youngest brother, the one with the white shoes and the big mouth; Manny, his father's brother who had two passions (women and food) and Brother Connely, teacher of sex education -- or ''sexual responsibility'' -- at Xavier High School in Middletown. The girls went to Mercy High -- Xavier's sister school.,Mr. Scionti also tells of his Mama Rosa going into a ''Sicilian tirade of degradation'' at the sight of a Progresso can when she wants Tuttorossa tomatoes for the marinara sauce. ''What do you think we are?'' she asks while she keeps cooking the eggplant casserole. ''Neopolitans?'',In the meantime, grandfather Morello's wife, Josephina, having lost her voice to throat cancer, won't go downstairs, so everyone has to shout upstairs. Mr. Scionti evokes the color and the dynamics of a family's role in his own coming of age.,Angelo Morello (1915 to 1990) migrated in 1955 from Sicily to Middletown, when Mr. Scionti was 10. A bandleader -- yes, he led a marching band and there was a fund-raising parade for St. Sebastian's Church in the Italian village -- Mr. Morelli became disillusioned when he joined a replica of St. Sebastian's in Middletown, Conn., comparing membership in the house of prayer with ticket buying in a club of V.I.P.'s.,In 1991, Mr. Scionti's parents left Middletown to retire to West Palm Beach, Fla., where his mother attends church and his father works for a synagogue. Many of Mr. Scionti's family members who live in Middletown filled the Schoolhouse on Saturday. High school friends, too. Everyone knew everyone.,''Hey, Joe,'' ''Hiya, Tony,'' ''John is there two seats over there?'' ''Sit down'' and ''Shh-Shh'' were heard throughout the 110-seat theater before the performance began. ''Mom,'' a young woman shouted across five rows. People in the front waved to others in the back. ''He doesn't talk about us,'' said one disappointed teen-age girl with some advance word about the play.,There were Aunt Joyce and Aunt Adele and Uncle Carmello -- and all their children and their dates. The Schoolhouse was just the place for a gathering -- and no one had died.,While it is hardly likely that ''The Gathering'' will go on playing to such an in group, with squeals of delight greeting every recognizable on-stage name, the play's message is lovely. Angelo Morello paid for Mr. Scionti's first dance lesson, and the agile 35-year-old actor re-creates his evolution as a dancer -- and his identity through dance -- from the age of 8 (dancing a contadina) to his mid-20's (during the disco craze, when he impersonates Tony Manero, the lead character in ''Saturday Night Fever'').,The athletic Mr. Scionti was taunted in Middletown for taking classical dance classes. Ballet meant giving up baseball. He wanted to be in the high school musical, but he also wanted ''to be normal like everybody else.'',It took the encouragement -- no, the inspiration -- of Angelo Morello who spoke of the importance of people ''going where their hearts take them up to the sky -- up there with Rossini,'' he said.,''Michelangelo painted the chapel for people to look up.'' he added.,Angelo Morello was discouraged by his own father, who was a shoemaker. ''I shoe-make. You shoe-make,'' his father had said. But Angelo said life-changing words to his grandson, Steve: ''Your father make you like you.'' It was then that Steve Scionti quit the baseball team for the bottle dance in ''Fiddler on the Roof'' at Xavier High.,No, you don't have to be Italian-American to relate to ''The Gathering'' even though Mr. Scionti makes you think you are. By the time the tale of Angelo Morello has been told, you know that flights of angels truly sang him to his rest.,''The Gathering,'' produced by the Schoolhouse, 1 Owens Road in Croton Falls.

"A day before the arrival of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the Chinese Government tonight expressed ''strong resentment'' in a predictably tart response to the lambasting of its human rights record in a State Department report on Friday.,The official Chinese statement, read on the state-run television, accused Washington of meddling in China's internal affairs by ''fabricating unwarranted charges'' while ignoring serious rights violations in its own country.,The statement, however, did not mention the detention for questioning on Friday of Wu Yilong, one of the founders of a banned alternative political party, in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Nor did it note the sentencing without trial of Peng Ming, a liberal intellectual who had attempted to run an independent discussion forum in Beijing, and who was given one and a half years in a labor camp.,These latest developments will only add to the pressure on Ms. Albright to take a strong line on human rights in the talks she will hold here with Chinese leaders on Monday. While both sides are hoping to nurture common ground in the meetings, Ms. Albright will undoubtedly prod China over other perennial American concerns, such as weapons sales and a widening trade imbalance.,In return, however, she is likely to get an earful from the Chinese, who are worried and perplexed by the seeming nose dive in relations with the United States, which only last summer pledged to work for a ''strategic partnership.'',Recent American policies and statements, Chinese foreign policy experts assert, have been insensitive to China's needs on several matters. These include the Administration's decision this week to bar sale of a satellite to a company with indirect ties to the Chinese military, its sharp criticism on human rights violations, its demands for a rapid opening of markets and talk of a possible missile defense system for Taiwan.,China tends to see specific setbacks, such as the barred satellite sale, as the work of deeper, hostile political forces. ''We interpret the satellite dispute as a reflection of strategic thinking that regards China as a threat and an adversary,'' said Chu Shulong, director of North American studies at the China Institute for Contemporary International Relations, a Government research organization.,''The talk in America of a 'China threat,' '' Mr. Chu said, ''is something we really worry about.'',In the Chinese view, their country is no threat, but is simply taking its rightful place as a great power. Many of the strongest American concerns about China, analysts here tend to believe, reflect a desire to keep China in a second-class status.,Among officials and even many liberal intellectuals, there is deep resentment of what they see as a foreign caricature of an increasingly diverse and vibrant Chinese society as a grim police state. Some who have actively threatened Communist Party rule have been jailed, they concede. But at the same time, people here note, Chinese have more personal choices than ever, private business is booming and the rule of law is starting to take hold.,Ms. Albright's visit, and another later in the week by the American trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, are intended in part to prepare for a high-profile visit to the United States in April by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.,Trade officials are negotiating furiously over China's desired entry into the World Trade Organization. A breakthrough would crown Mr. Zhu's American trip and boost bilateral relations. But chances appear slim that China, grappling with a major restructuring of industry and soaring unemployment, can make enough trade concessions now to satisfy American demands.,Despite festering problems, both Governments seem to hope that Mr. Zhu's visit can rekindle some of the glow that emanated from the exchange of summit meetings in late 1997 and last summer.,Chinese leaders are anxious to sustain friendly ties. They know that American technology and cooperation are vital to their economic progress and that American culture is widely admired among the population.,At the same time, the Chinese are smarting over what they see as worrisome trends in American policy. They fear that the decision to bar a commercial satellite sale portends new, broader curbs on transfers of advanced technologies. Though investigations and official reports in Washington suggest otherwise, Chinese officials, in public at least, scoff at the notion that they are stealing secrets for military application.,''The Americans complain about a trade gap, but then they don't want to sell what China wants to buy,'' said Jia Qingguo, a professor of international studies at Beijing University.,On human rights, China will vehemently urge the United States not to sponsor a resolution criticizing China at the annual United Nations conference on human rights, to begin in Geneva in late March. But in the wake of stiff sentences China has dealt to several democracy activists, Congress is pressuring the Administration to act.,The Chinese Government has made a commitment to change its human rights practices gradually, said Mr. Jia, but it also worries about social stability as it tackles severe economic problems.,''What do Americans wish China to do, unleash a wave of political unrest?'' Mr. Jia asked. ''Political instability here is not in the interest of the United States.'',In meetings Monday with Secretary Albright, Chinese officials are also sure to register adamant opposition to proposed research by the United States and Japan on a ''theater missile defense'' system. Discussions of missile defenses were quickened by North Korea's test of a long-range missile -- seen especially as a threat to Japan -- as well as by China's buildup of missiles on its coast facing Taiwan.,China has warned that introducing missile defenses to Asia will only trigger a regional arms race. But the basic idea of using such weapons to shore up American power in Asia -- and possibly blunt China's -- is anathema here. And what most outrages the Chinese is the speculation that such a shield might be extended to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.,Providing missile defenses to Taiwan, Mr. Jia said, ''would not only damage China's sovereignty, but also pose an obstacle to unification of the country.'',China's leaders know that these issues and others will inevitably divide Beijing and Washington. But they had hoped, especially after Mr. Clinton's glittering visit here last June, that disagreements could be boxed off as the countries pursued their ''partnership.'',As an overarching goal of this week's meetings and the Prime Minister's April visit, Mr. Chu said, ''China wants to reconfirm the positive trend in relations.''",ERIK ECKHOLM,"FEB. 28, 1999",Tensions Rise Before Albright's China Trip,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/world/tensions-rise-before-albright-s-china-trip.html
"FOR almost 22 years, Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers, have been doling out belly laughs and -- they proudly proclaim -- bad car advice on public radio's ''Car Talk.'' Their audience on 489 stations around the country is inching dangerously close to three million listeners a week. The series (which is heard in New York on WNYC-FM Saturday mornings at 10 and WNYC-AM Saturdays at noon) is National Public Radio's most popular non-news show, and nobody seems to know why.,Don't ask the stars, whose real names are Tom and Ray Magliozzi, advises Ken Rogers, the associate producer. ''The boys are as amazed as the rest of us that they've been tolerated this long,'' he said.,A visit with the ''Car Talk'' crew offers some clues as to what has solidified their hold on a generation of listeners whom they have teased, tested and tutored. They offer a weekly hour of general silliness sandwiched between car advice, automotive puzzlers and relentless irreverence (directed toward the callers as well as each other).,WBUR Radio is on the Boston University campus, a block from the Charles River, in a neighborhood that looks -- and is -- institutional. The studio is new and up to date, but the Magliozzi brothers like to think of themselves as throwbacks to a more leisurely time. On this Wednesday, a taping day, Ray, 49, the teddy bear of the pair, has gone for a Sears, Roebuck look in his plaid shirt, chinos and comfortable rubber-soled shoes. Tom, 61, a bit more of a grizzly, is wearing chinos and a fashionably faded denim shirt. They arrive with a shopping bag full of treats, which, since they've sworn off fried pork rinds, includes bagels and cream cheese with bacon grease.,They joke with the crew until they're on the air. Then they joke with the callers and each other. What you hear is what they are.,''We're out to have a good time and if, by accident we happen to help someone, so be it,'' said Ray, who still runs the car repair shop that the brothers started in 1973. The Magliozzi empire also includes a syndicated newspaper column, three CD's and ''Car Talk'' the book.,Questions about their success inspire answers about the show's supposed business unit, formally named the Shameless Commerce Division of the law firm Dewey Cheatham & Howe in Harvard Square. And as listeners know, the guys never forget their extensive and highly fictionalized staff in the closing credits. Among them: the customer care representative, Heywood Jabuzoff; the chief negotiator, Bernadette Bridge; the director of geriatrics, Al Takaka; the staff grammarian, I. M. Shirley Wright; the oral historian, Studds Tercel,  and the chairman of the Federal Lubrication Board, Alan Greasepan.,But reality does occasionally rear its rude head in the brothers' lives. Once, lawyers for Chrysler visited the Magliozzis after they had called the automaker's mini-van ''a piece of junk.'' ''Like the I.R.S., they're a little thin-skinned,'' Tom said. ''A bunch of babies, really.'',Most of the time, however, the hosts try not to take anything too seriously. On the air, they laugh at their own often-repeated jokes (like ''I bought my wife a Freudian slip'' and ''Keep your chins up''). ''Our mother always tells us,'' Ray said, '' 'Don't worry, no one's listening.' '',Determined to lead lives in which fun comes first, the ''Car Talk'' guys, who grew up in a gritty section of this erudite town, have declined offers from television networks and Hollywood moguls to embark on grander enterprises. They prefer to be immersed in their own universe, in what Bostonians like to deride as the Republic of Cambridge, a grandly quirky municipality where Nobel laureates and out-of-work car mechanics rub shoulders daily.,Ray still works at the garage almost every day. (He asked that its name remain confidential lest he be inundated with work.) Tom, meanwhile, manages the Web site (www.cartalk.com.) unless it's good weather. Then he's out driving his 1963 Dodge Dart convertible.,''It's sleek, it's black, and it's beautiful,'' said Tom, who constantly admonishes listeners not to waste money buying new cars. Ray, meanwhile, drives a modern, fuel-efficient 1987 Dodge Colt Vista. ''It's a dirt brown -- so it never has to be washed -- marvel of engineering,'' he said.,''Not to mention a study in ugliness,'' Tom added.,On weekends, they congregate with their own families, their parents and their sister, Lucille, a music promoter.,''She's the black sheep,'' noted Tom.,''Right,'' confirmed Ray. ''She's likable, well mannered and successful.'',The brothers' fascination with cars was born in the 1950's when Tom did emergency repairs on his father's 1932 Chevy as Ray watched in awe.,Momentarily misguided, both attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tom graduated in 1958 as a chemical engineer and actually worked for a local manufacturer for 15 years. Ray describes himself as, ''M.I.T., class of '70, '71 and '72, majoring in mechanical engineering, math and humanities.'',After graduation (the last one), he relocated to Bennington, Vt., to teach junior high school. ''It was charming, till I moved there,'' he said. ''Then it was like a one-year prison sentence.'',In 1973, Tom quit his job. ''I had to be there at 8 A.M. and wear a tie --  every day!'' he recalled.,Soon after, Ray got a call from his mother. ''She begged me to come home to rescue Tommy or he'd slip into oblivion,'' he said. ''Also, I was promised barrels of money.'',In 1977, four years after they opened the garage, a WBUR talk show host invited Tom to join a few other mechanics for a show on car repairs. For publicity's sake, Tom actually showed up. He was the only one who did.,''We had a panel of expert,'' he reminisced.,The host asked Tom to return. He did and brought his brother. But, they recalled, ''the host had been fired but left a note: 'Good luck. Watch your language.' '',The brothers went on and were soon offered a show of their own. For five years, they actually focused on serious car issues; then they got bored. ''There were enough shows that gave useful answers,'' said Ray. ''We didn't want to do that.'',So the real fun started and they became entertainment icons with banter like:,''Hey Tommy, remember last week's puzzler?'',''No.'',''It was a literary tale.'',''Shakespearean?'',''No. Volkswagean.'',In 1987, Tom stopped working at the garage. ''I finally slipped into oblivion,'' he said. And the show was picked up by N.P.R. The ''Car Talk'' guys, it seems, have become top earners for the nonprofit public radio system, taking in as much as $60,000 an hour during fund-raisers, said Murray Horwitz, N.P.R.'s cultural programming director.,''They've become a great expression of American humor,'' Mr. Horwitz said. ''And they really do know cars.'',For 1999, the brothers say, the most reliable car is a Toyota; the most obnoxious is a red BMW of any year. To find an honest mechanic, they suggest, ''Get someone whose boat is paid for and has no kids in college.'',Meanwhile, the most important thing to know about automotive maintenance this year is, ''Prepare for Y2K,'' said Tom.,Ray added: ''If you want to know how, send $1 to 'Car Talk.' No self-addressed stamped envelope needed.'' He almost sounded serious.",SUSAN DIESENHOUSE,"FEB. 28, 1999","TELEVISION / RADIO; Out in Car Country, Banter Is Their Language",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/television-radio-out-in-car-country-banter-is-their-language.html
"IT started with O. J. but the seeds were sown long ago, in Ohio, my ancestral stomping grounds, where the license plates say, ''Fasten your seat belts.'' In other words, the message was, ''Step on it and keep going.'' I'm suggestible and I did keep going, until Route 66 ended at the Pacific Ocean and I had to put on the brakes.,Over time, I developed an appreciation for the radio traffic report. It mesmerizes and informs; it has rhythm and it paints an image.

And for years, Bob Tur was the guy who traversed the freeways of Los Angeles by air, in his helicopter, monitoring accidents, jams and barrier situations (a sonorous and relatively new locution referring to what happens when a person who is the object of a vehicle pursuit is cornered by the police, gets out of the car, runs away and hides behind a barricade).,Which brings me to my current obsession: televised vehicle pursuits. For just as the radio traffic report is the haiku of the hills, the blank verse of the beaches, the televised vehicle pursuit is the performance art of the pavement, the theater of the thoroughfare -- and it tells a story about those who dwell in this dusty region. What kind of car is the pursued driving? Is it his/hers or has it been carjacked? Is the rightful driver still in the car? How many police cars are pursuing the vehicle? How fast is the prey traveling? Is the driving erratic? Does the fugitive prefer the freeway or surface streets? Will there be a shootout when the hunted motorist runs out of gas? Or will the car spin out of control when its tires are ripped apart on the special flight-stopping spikes on the road up ahead?,Like all stories in a vast community linked only by freeways, the vehicle pursuit binds those who watch it to the American condition: being in motion.,Who can forget the great O. J. Simpson low-speed car chase of 1994? That pursuit is a classic glyph of the form, bearing every element central to the American drama. A football icon (celebrity) is suspected of killing  his estranged wife (beauty) and her male friend (youth); as the cops close in, he attempts the run of his life (flight), heading for Mexico (idyllic land of no rules, which exists as a haven for renegades) with his college sidekick (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid).,I don't understand why people say there's nothing good on television. Vehicle pursuits are all over the airwaves these days, at least in Los Angeles, and when I can't hit the road myself, I know I can escape by watching someone else try to.,For instance, as the curtain fell on the impeachment epic, I was fortunate enough to happen upon a Bentley pursuit. This was a very good one, as pursuits go. It was high-speed, which meant that there was the possibility of a big, expensive hunk of metal hitting a retaining wall and making a loud, crunching sound. (And don't accuse me of being perverse: isn't this why you watch Nascar races?),There were several crimes going on at once. The owner of the car was locked in the trunk. A pair of kidnappers drove the car. Several squad cars chased the Bentley east on the Ventura Freeway through Woodland Hills and followed it as it turned off at Tampa Avenue, collided with a Chevrolet Cavalier, careered into a utility pole and caught fire. The owner was thrown from the trunk. His kidnappers fled, leading police on a foot pursuit, which was televised until they disappeared into the ethers of the Valley. Two weeks later, they had yet to be caught -- for real or on tape.,If you missed this broadcast -- or live in an area (like New York) that does not generally televise car chases -- take heart. The Learning Channel broadcasts reruns of such memorable moments on a show called ''Dangerous Pursuits.'' Recently, I found myself mesmerized by a four-year-old tank pursuit. (The cranking up of the type of pursuit, in terms of the machinery involved, is one of the things that makes the genre so interesting. I'm waiting to see how far it can go -- a big-rig pursuit, perhaps?) The tank pursuit involved a disgruntled worker who had carjacked a tank from Camp Pendleton and gone on a 25-minute rampage through the streets of San Diego.,The best thing about this chase was the narration, added by the Learning Channel, in almost reverent tones, reminiscent of a nature show about a lion hunt.,''There goes a signpost,'' the voice said. ''And now another. Look at how easily he rams the RV.'',Amazing, I thought, as said RV was crushed. What's next? A quick cut to a bus pursuit! Here, a two-ton bus (got to know that weight) was trying to outrun the California Highway Patrol on the San Diego Freeway.,''It's going in excess of 70 miles per hour!'' the voice called. ''It's grand theft bus! Ironically, he doesn't forget to use his left-turn signal when he comes off the exit ramp! The night before there were several hundred kids at this intersection! He crushes a chain-link fence. He strikes a patrol car. This bus is out of control! But he keeps going! It's a cul-de-sac. He's backing up into the officers' path! Into a house. Shots are fired.'',Bob Tur retired soon after the O. J. pursuit (''I was burnt out on pursuits,'' he says) and makes a living by selling his old footage. He laments the state of today's coverage of vehicle pursuits. The reporting is terrible, he suggests. But that doesn't stop me and, evidently, many others from watching. Now, for $9.99 for a three-month trial period, the Pursuit Watch Network will page subscribers whenever a television chopper is covering a freeway drama.,Since I'm not a drug dealer or an actor, I've never felt that I had to be permanently available. But things are different now. ''Excuse me,'' I'll tell friends when paged at dinner. ''Got to go. It's a vehicle pursuit!'' It's L.A. I'm sure they'll understand.",DEANNE STILLMAN,"FEB. 28, 1999",TELEVISION / RADIO; Cops on the Freeway in Pursuit.

"LATE last year, an unwelcome headline appeared on the front page of The Hindu, the very staid English-language daily of Madras. ''Crowbar for the Heritage Buildings,'' the newspaper reported. ''One by one, age-old buildings are making way to vulgar commercial constructions . . . Buildings which once occupied the pride of place look a picture of neglect with weeds and shrubs sprouting from their roofs. The resplendence of a great heritage is today only a memory.'',Some weeks before that, over a dinner of spiced lamb chops at the Connemara Hotel, S. Muthiah, the city's foremost historian, lamented the state of British colonial architecture in his beloved city. ''Before the British there was no Madras,'' he told me, sadly. ''It seems that after the British there will be no Madras either.'' He took a small sip of cold beer, and averted his gaze. The story of Madras can be a painful one.,The last episode of this story was a politically inspired change of name. Madras is now known officially as Chennai, believed by local ideologues to be its correct Tamil appellation. The city's residents, however, stick stubbornly to Madras in their ordinary dealings, although businesses have had to spend a fortune on new letterheads.,The city is steeped in powerful romance. Founded on a nondescript sliver of beach on the southeastern coast of India in 1639 by officers of the East India Company, Madras provided the British with their first serious foothold on Indian land. They built Fort St. George, at first little more than a fortified warehouse, but which came to be the bastion from which the company ventured further and further afield. It was here that they made their first grand profits, and here that they recruited their first native armies. It was in the city's Tamil hinterland that Robert Clive first took on the French in a series of battles for India's imperial custody; and Madras was the place where Elihu Yale, one of the city's earliest Governors, made the fortune that endowed the university that bears his name.,The British ran Madras from 1639 to 1947, the year of India's independence, and in few other colonial cities can their imprint have been so strong. ''At independence,'' said Mr. Muthiah, ''Madras was a gracious city, a garden city. It was green, verdant. The place was orderly, the buildings gleaming, the streets uncluttered. Now almost everything is a mess.'',Mr. Muthiah is not an apologist for the Raj. He is merely an old-fashioned man, unwilling to consign a building to the scrap heap merely because its builders were colonizers. The author of ''Madras Discovered'' -- ''an historical guide to looking around the city'' -- he is part of a small band of men and women who research and write about the dwindling heritage of their city. He has also convened the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, a citizens' group that focuses on the architecture of bygone eras, noting violations of zoning laws, taking municipalities to task for their neglect of buildings and challenging the local government in court whenever it seeks to demolish a colonial structure to make room for a high-rise building. Theirs is an uphill struggle, and the longer a visitor postpones a trip to Madras, the greater the chance that another jewel will have fallen victim to the wreckers' ball.,For now, Madras is still a treasure house of British colonial architecture, with the Regency and Indo-Saracenic styles particularly prevalent. The latter, conceived in this city by Paul Benfield more than  200 years ago, is the style by which the British Raj found its truest architectural idiom. The grander buildings of Lutyens's New Delhi, constructed in the first part of this century, have their roots in Madras, and there are some colonial buildings in this southern Indian metropolis that easily match those in the capital for their grandeur and panache.,Two obvious examples are the High Court, and the railway station in the Egmore district. The first, built in 1892, is a red brick leviathan, believed to be the largest judicial building in the world after the Courts of London. As for the station -- with its towers capped with domed pavilions -- there can be few places that provide quite so enchanting a locale from which to catch a train.,But my favorite, Mr. Muthiah's favorite, everyone's favorite, is the Senate House of Madras University. My father received his degree there in 1954 and I saw it for the first time last November. The building is a breathtaking Indo-Saracenic confection, built by Robert Chisholm, master of the genre, in 1873. It is of red brick, and blends Byzantine, Moorish and Rajput Hindu styles.,The windows, illuminated with colored glass, are set behind arches held up by solid pillars. The building is topped with domed finials and square towers, with projecting balconies shaded by angled eaves.,BUT wander inside, and you will encounter an astonishing state of disrepair. The stained glass is mostly broken or smashed. The once-varnished teakwood floor has been ruined by the march of a million careless feet, bird droppings, paint, dirt and bat feces. Wild plants grow, unheeded, inside the House, forcing themselves out through cracks in the wall and ceiling. Bats, beetles, birds, cats, moths and bees have made themselves at home. The university, not surprisingly, no longer uses the place  for degree ceremonies: when I was there,  the main hall had been rented by a firm exhibiting a meager range of office accessories. When a salesman observed me taking notes, he assumed I was a trade visitor. ''Would you like to know about our Velcro boards?'' he enquired, with the politesse of the Madrassi. I did not have the heart to say no.,The efforts of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage -- which recently saved a magnificent Regency-style Masonic building from the bulldozers, a building that will now house the state police headquarters -- appear to have moved Madras University to act at last to rescue Senate House. The vice chancellor has appointed B. Narasimhaiah -- an archeologist who led an Indian team that restored parts of Angkor Wat -- to oversee the restoration of the Senate House. The cost is expected to be about $1 million. The sum is astronomical by Indian standards, especially for a university.,The Senate House stands a few hundred yards away from the Marina Beach, the stretch of sand that is Madras's favorite open-air playground. Of an evening, the beach is a hive of strolling families, courting couples, scurrying children, vendors and acrobats. As one walks south, away from Senate House, one can see the city's other Indo-Saracenic masterpiece, Chepauk Palace, now taken over by myriad government departments. Completed in 1768 as the palace of Muhammad Ali Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot, the palace was probably designed by Benfield, who was also the princeling's greatest creditor. The building, which once dominated the city's skyline, is now hidden from view by modern concrete structures, and a visitor must snake past these to reach what was once an architectural gem. Its ornate facade is no longer visible.,Although the former palace is not officially open to the public, it is possible to wander quietly through its wings and floors. Inside, you will observe a thousand bureaucrats at work or asleep, their walls covered with posters, flyers, betel-nut stains and graffiti, with crude partitions scarring the majesty of once-expansive halls.,Farther along the Marina is Presidency College, in whose buildings Chisholm combined the Italianate with the Saracenic and the Hindu. Upkeep for this courtly red brick building, just a stone's throw from the beach, is beyond the university's meager finances. Stroll in here too, as no one will impede the passage of a well-intentioned visitor, and savor the buildings from an age when Madras was the intellectual capital of India. Loyola College, in the city's Nungambakkam district, is equally alluring. Teeming with earnest students, it is in better physical condition than most colonial buildings in Madras.,The British Raj was not without its spiritual side, and a visitor to Madras cannot afford to miss two colonial churches of contrasting style and state of repair. The first is St. Andrew's Kirk, now undergoing major restoration after decades of neglect.,Consecrated in 1821, the church was considered by many in the time of the Raj to be ''the noblest edifice in Hindustan.'' Visitors enter the neo-classical church through a massive pedimented Ionic portico, which is surmounted by a svelte tower with a tapering, octagonal spire. The spire, whose weathercock is 167 feet above ground level, is visible from afar in low-rise Madras.,Wander through the church, whose circular nave is topped by a dome that rests on 16 Ionic pillars, and marvel at its rare Scotch beauty, its rich woodwork and some of the finest stained glass in Asia. Bearing in mind that this was the church of colonizers erected in the midst of a sea of colonized people, the commemorative plaques acquire a powerful poignancy. Many men died young, and many perished of disease or in battle.,I was struck particularly by one plaque, accompanied by the marble figure of the dead officer, his left hand on hip, his swashbuckling mustache at full twirl: ''Erected by the officers of the Regiment and a few other military friends to the memory of Lieut. Col. James Walker, 3d Regiment Madras Light Infantry who was killed when leading a column of Madras troops to the storm of the Birmese intrenched lines near Rangoon on the 5th of December 1824.'' The inscription ended: ''One of India's best and bravest soldiers.'',St. Mary's Church, built in Fort St. George for the British garrison, is reputed to be the oldest Anglican church east of the Suez. There, near the altar, I came upon these words: ''Sacred to the memory of Major Godfrey Webster Whistler, commanding the 19th Regiment Madras Native Infantry, who died of cholera at Paulghautcherry, on the 14th of March 1843, in the 42d year of his age.'' Above the altar hangs a huge Raphaelite painting of ''The Last Supper,'' thought to have been brought as war booty from the nearby French colony of Pondicherry in 1761. The charming whitewashed church was built in 1678, as the spiritual focus for the burgeoning British population of Madras, and counted Governor Yale among its congregation. Yale was married here, and a yellowed register on display in a glass case at the back records the event. A muted neo-classical tower was added in 1701, and its steeple in 1795.,Mr. Muthiah writes glowingly of this dignified little church in his book ''Madras: The Gracious City'': ''Tombstones and memorials, registers and paintings, Bibles and silver plate -- material for a museum in the view of some, perhaps -- are all that survive in St. Mary's. But when a visitor walks through its portals, he walks with the ghost of Fort St. George, men and women who wrote 200 years of history all over the world.'',There is still much that is left of the fort, now occupied by the provincial government and its functionaries. Visit the five main gates, each with an entry of rounded masonry, and observe the sloping ramparts. Walk past the parade ground, surrounded by barracks for local regiments, and head for the Fort Museum, one of the most compelling places in Madras.,Originally the Public Exchange Hall, the museum now houses a collection of arms, coins, documents and portraits from the glory days of the city. One room displays the silver dishes and ewers bequeathed to St. Mary's Church in 1687 by the magnanimous Yale. Another has a collection of letters, mounted for easy reading, from the men of the Company to their overseers back home.  A missive from Clive to the Select Committee, dated Feb. 6, 1757, reads in part: ''Gentlemen, I have got just time to acquaint you that yesterday morning we attacked the Nabob's Army consisting of 40,000 men and made a prodigious slaughter.'',From Fort St. George, go to George Town, or the Black Town, as it was known to the British. This is the township, abutting on the fortifications, where the Indians resided. It is still the hub of the city's commerce. Narrow, cramped lanes lead the walker from one wholesale area to another. Entire streets are given over to one type of goods: here you will find only leather sandals, there only stationery; in the street adjacent, only vegetables and fruit; in the street beyond that, plastic sheeting alone. The warren effect can be daunting to untutored wanderers, so go accompanied by a local guide. This will only enhance the pleasure of getting to the Indian heart of what is still, tenaciously, a very British city.,Old World rooms, pomegranate juice and friendly drivers,Where to Stay,The whitewashed Art Deco Connemara Hotel, 2 Binney Road, (91) 44-852-0123, is a haven of calm just off the bustling Anna Salai (formerly Mount Road), the city's main commercial artery. It is 11 miles, or 30 minutes, from the airport. If your budget permits it, stay in one of the spacious Old World rooms. Although the furniture is modern, the large bay windows, each with rattan or canvas blinds, evoke the expansive days of the Raj. A standard double is $155, or $165 facing the pool; Old World rooms are $235, suites $260, all plus 30 percent tax.,When to Go,The climate of Madras ranges from hot to hottest, so there is never a cool season in the American sense. Between late October and February is probably the best time. Proof of this is the fact that international cricket matches, played for a sapping five consecutive days, are always held in this period.,Where to Eat,The finest restaurant in Madras, Dakshin, in the Park Sheraton Hotel, 132 TTK Road, (91) (44) 499-4101, serves the cuisine of India's four southern states. The food is very spicy, and expensive by local standards. It is packed at dinner time, so reservations are advisable. A meal for two, with beer, is about $28 to $42.,Raintree, in the Connemara Hotel, 2 Binny Road, (91) 852-0123, is another southern Indian restaurant, open only for dinner. The tables are outdoors, with lanterns the only source of light. Classical musicians and dancers perform on a nearby stage, making for a heady, romantic experience. A meal for two, about $24. Reservations advised.,Annalakshmi, 804 Anna Salai, (91) 852-5109, is a vegetarian restaurant run by middle-class volunteers from a Hindu sect. Your waitress could be a doctor or an accountant, and she will almost certainly give you a brief religious discourse, delivered with a beaming smile. The delicious food costs about $14 a head. There is no alcohol, but you could try the pomegranate juice.,Buildings Worth a Visit,The Senate House, Chepauk Palace and  Presidency College are all on Kamaraj Salai. (Salai is the Tamil word for street.),Loyola College: Sterling Road.,St. Andrew's Kirk: 37 Poonamallee High Road; (91-44) 583-508.,St Mary's Church: Fort St. George.,Fort Museum: Fort St. George (9 A.M. to 5 P.M.; closed Friday); (91-44) 582-4015.,High Court: NSC Bose Road.,Getting Around,The best way to get around in Madras is to hire a chauffeur-driven car from your hotel. For $24 to $28 a day, you can get an air-conditioned Indian car with a friendly driver who speaks a smattering of English.

Sadly, almost as many of these buildings are burnt out or misused in illegal entrepreneurial activity.,As you point out, landmarking can have the negative effect of preserving urban decay by making development prohibitively expensive and bureaucratic. While full of landmark worthy Queen Anne row houses, the Mount Morris Historic District also contains some of the area's highest drug dealing statistics and close to 30 percent building vacancy.,Rather than a blanket landmark policy we need a more sophisticated system that distinguishes building shells from inhabited residences and works in tandem with development incentives by offering added tax breaks and low-interest loans to owners who develop to landmarks specifications.

"To the Sports Editor:,In ''How to Save the Olympics'' (The Times, Feb. 14), David D'Alessandro cites a particularly shocking example of corrupt activity by a bidding city; $160,000 spent by Sydney transporting seven horses to Mongolia to ''curry favor'' with the local International Olympic Committee member.,An examination of the facts is in order. The seven horses involved were the extremely rare Przewalski wild horse, or takhi, long extinct in its native Mongolia, which had been successfully bred in captivity by the world-renowned Western Plains Zoo in New South Wales, Australia. This was part of a longstanding international effort to reintroduce the takhi into Mongolia, a project that predated even Sydney's announcement that it would bid for the 2000 Games.,The horses were actually transported to Mongolia in the fall of 1995 -- two full years after Sydney was awarded the Games -- as the result of a state visit by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs.,There was absolutely no connection with the Olympic bidding process whatsoever.,Sydney did do one thing to ''curry favor'' with the Mongolian I.O.C. member, however. During his official visit to the city he was taken to see the horses at the zoo and presented with a photo album to take back to the Ministry of the Environment.,SEAN BURKE,Aurora, Ill.,The writer worked for the Sydney bid committee.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",Sydney's View,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/l-sydney-s-view-548073.html
"EARLY in the film ''Pleasantville,'' a teen-age boy named David flops onto the couch of his suburban home, eyes fixed on the television for a rerun of a 1950's sitcom, all banter about Mom's meatloaf and the school science fair. Just behind David, meanwhile, his mother argues over the telephone with her ex-husband about who's stuck with custody of the boy this weekend. Before long, in the pivotal moment of ''Pleasantville,'' he finds himself transported through the picture tube and into the show.,That scene conflates the two standard images of suburbia in American culture. It is either the scrubbed and cheerful utopia of such actual television series as ''Ozzie and Harriet'' and ''Leave It to Beaver'' or else it is the miserable, materialistic dystopia of novelists like John Cheever and Rick Moody. From either extreme, the chroniclers of suburbia agree on this much: it is white and upper middle class.,In the last generation, however, suburbia has evolved in startling ways, becoming ever more varied by race, class and ethnicity and eluding the grasp of all but a handful of perceptive artists and entertainers. As highbrow films like Todd Solondz's ''Happiness'' and popular-culture phenomena like ''The Brady Bunch'' revival peddle the same old cliches, reaping money and praise by pandering to audiences that share their smug presumptions, figures as disparate as the author Junot Diaz of ''Drown,'' the filmmaker Tamara Jenkins of ''Slums of Beverly Hills'' and the comic D. L. Hughley of the television series ''The Hughleys'' are presenting the complex portrait of suburbia circa 2000.,''I always feel really alone in this conversation,'' says Mr. Diaz, a Dominican immigrant reared in central New Jersey. ''The world I've created feels lonely.'' He could be speaking for the fellow artists who depict a suburbia of low-rent apartments beside gated developments, of strip malls and toxic-waste dumps, of the improbable commingling of ambitious immigrants, upwardly mobile minorities and working-class whites whose security is imperiled by downsizing and deindustrialization.,''The suburbs have changed, but our way of looking at them hasn't changed,'' says Rosalyn Baxandall, a professor of American studies at the State University of New York in Old Westbury and co-author of the forthcoming book ''Picture Windows: How the Suburbs Happened.'' ''The stereotype has always been that the suburbs are for rich people who ran away from the city, and there's alienation and conformity. But when I teach my classes, my students are mostly nonwhite. I've had 17 languages in a class. Some of these families are taking in boarders. It's a big, big revelation.'',Demographic data lend authority to what Mr. Diaz and Ms. Baxandall describe. The percentage of blacks who live in suburbia rose from 23 percent in 1970 to 32 percent in 1990, the demographer William Frey of the State University of New York at Albany has found. Some 40 percent of all minorities are suburbanites, according to the 1990 census. The Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park, which is 60 percent Chinese, has emerged as the archetype of the so-called ''ethnoburb.'',The counterbalance to the successful movement of immigrants and minorities into suburbia, though, is the deterioration of inner-ring suburbs. These communities, clinging to the borders of cities, have been growing poorer, more segregated and more troubled for decades, losing population nearly as rapidly in some cases as urban ghettoes. Several years ago, the Federal Government surrounded its own office complex in Suitland, Md., a suburb just outside Washington, with a chain-link fence topped by razor wire.,The seismic shifts that have engaged scholars, though, have escaped many of the makers and consumers of culture. ''What's missed is the diversity of suburbia,'' says Greg Hise, a historian at the University of Southern California who specializes in urban planning. ''At least with urban novels and films, you see cities as a place of freedom, autonomy, possibility. With the suburbs, the writers and producers and directors are working with a set of accepted wisdom. We see the same stories about suburbia because we expect them.'',Early in this century, suburbia actually received a more nuanced portrayal. Academics like Graham Taylor and Chauncey Harris delineated a variety of suburbs -- commuter, industrial, working class. F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby,'' set in a fictional version of Great Neck, N.Y., memorably etched the tensions between old money and parvenus, treating Gatsby's social climbing as the stuff of tragedy.,With the suburban boom after World War II, however, the stereotype of nuclear families in split-level homes was born. If in truth suburbia was already more stratified than that, with white-collar Scarsdale virtually next door to blue-collar Mount Vernon, the myth nonetheless reflected a certain amount of fact about the fast growing middle-class and the extraordinary increase in home ownership. It was true, too, that Federal mortgage regulations and private covenants conspired to keep much of suburbia white.,Television mirrored this version of the suburbs to the nation and the world. ''Father Knows Best,''  ''The Donna Reed Show'' and their ilk delivered what the historian Stephanie Coontz has termed ''our most powerful visions of traditional families.'' Homogeneity was part of the package. Desi Arnaz of ''I Love Lucy,'' perhaps the only Hispanic star on a network show in the 1950's, lived in the city. So did Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam) on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' television's first identifiably Jewish character.,Inevitably the counterattack came, replacing one cartoonish version of suburbia with another. Journalists and social scientists -- David Riesman in ''The Lonely Crowd,'' William Whyte in ''The Organization Man,'' Betty Friedan in ''The Feminine Mystique'' -- argued that beneath the contented exterior of the salaryman and his stay-at-home wife lurked an anomie that Ms. Friedan called ''the problem that has no name.'' Only the rare contrarian like Herbert Gans in ''The Levittowners'' portrayed a nourishing sense of community among the tract houses.,Novelists, in turn, transmuted the theme of suburban malaise in fiction. Sloan Wilson created both a character and a catch-phrase with the public relations man Tom Rath in ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.'' (Gregory Peck starred in the film adaptation.) Robert Sheckley (''The Ticket to Trania'') and Frederick Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth (''Gladiator-at-Law'') made their critiques in the form of science fiction.,Still, it was three naturalistic writers who supplied literature's most indelible images of postwar suburbia as the American dream gone awry. John Updike's ''Couples,'' set in a town dismissively dubbed Tarbox, put wife swapping into the cultural lexicon. In a vast body of short stories and novels, John Cheever painted the WASP elite in the moral emptiness of its country clubs and commuter trains; the places he created -- Bullet Park, Shady Hill, St. Botolphs -- defined a social geography that could be reduced to the shorthand ''Cheever Country.'' Philip Roth, meanwhile, disposed of the ethnic arrivistes, typified by the gauche and acquisitive Patimkin family in his novella ''Goodbye, Columbus.'',The young radicals of the 1960's put the critique in overtly political terms. In their founding manifesto, the Port Huron Statement, the Students for a Democratic Society pointedly described themselves as having been ''bred in at least modest comfort'' in ''the wealthiest and strongest country in the world'' and yet ''looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.'' Suburbia, in other words, was something to rebel against.,Folk music took up the cry. Malvina Reynolds's 1963 song ''Little Boxes,'' later covered by Pete Seeger, reduced suburbia to the refrain ''Little boxes, little boxes, little boxes all the same.'' The contempt for suburbia became so nearly unanimous in the emerging youth culture that even the Brill Building songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King and the made-for-television band the Monkees collaborated on ''Pleasant Valley Sunday.''  ''Another Pleasant Valley Sunday,'' went its chorus, ''charcoal burning everywhere. Another Pleasant Valley Sunday here in status symbol land.'',''If Dylan or the later Beatles had been singing that, being social critics, it almost would have been expected,'' says Paul Levinson, a visiting professor of communications at Fordham University. ''But the Monkees -- they're so suburban themselves, in effect. It's as if suburban people themselves were skewering the vacuity of their own lives.'',Such perceptions continue to thrive in some of the most highly praised recent films. Even as affirmative action, mass immigration and growing income inequality have altered the shape of suburbia, these movies, whether satirical, realistic or fantastical in tone, trot out all the familiar indictments.,A NG LEE'S screen adaptation of ''The Ice Storm,'' Rick Moody's novel about family discord in affluent New Canaan, Conn., had as its centerpiece that hoariest of cliches, a ''key party'' in which married couples trade partners. Peter Weir's ''Truman Show'' puts a patina of fantasy on its predictable attacks. Truman Burbank, an insurance agent whose life is the subject of a continuous sitcom, literally cannot escape the oppressive perfection of a made-for-television suburb called Sea Haven.,As written and directed by Gary Ross, ''Pleasantville'' carries a similar sensibility to even more overwrought ends. The visual conceit of the film -- that the eponymous suburb is shown in black and white -- merely hints at the didactic style. It takes David, the teen-ager deposited from the 1990's, to bring art, emotion  and color to town, and when he does, such predictable villains as the local bowling league and the Chamber of Commerce respond by desecrating paintings and burning books in Nazi style. The World War II veterans who thronged to actual suburbs in the 1950's might quibble ever so slightly with Mr. Ross's choice of analogy.,Todd Solondz, a native of New Jersey who calls his production company Suburban Pictures, means to speak for the misfits in a monochromatic world. His debut film, ''Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' centers on a girl gawkily teetering into puberty who is tormented by her classmates and ignored by her family. In tracing the lives of an extended family in his next feature, ''Happiness,'' Mr. Solondz reserves his greatest affection for the outsiders among them -- a failed songwriter, a boy discovering his sexuality, a grandmother being divorced by her husband of 40 years.,Such compassion, though, relies on cheap shots against whatever or whomever represents the suburban status quo. The white-collar father in ''Happiness,'' a Cheeveresque figure with his car phone and rep tie, cannot simply be unmasked as a hypocrite or a souse; no, he turns out to be a pederast who rapes his son's playmates. When Mr. Solondz's camera in ''Dollhouse'' surveys a suburban home, it lingers over a veritable catalogue of bad taste -- gaudy afghans, mismatched paneling, green shag carpet, cabinets stuffed with Yodels and Ring Dings. This kind of satire, far from seeking to jar an audience out of its complacency, sneers along with it from a superior distance.,''You know, people are always putting New Jersey down,'' says Helen, a writer who is a major character in ''Happiness.'' ''None of my friends can actually believe I live here. But that's because they don't get it. I'm living in a state of irony.'',Irony, though, is an indulgence of the entitled. The material comforts ridiculed in a film like ''Happiness'' shimmer like mirages for the artists of new suburbia. Tamara Jenkins, the writer and director of the autobiographical film ''Slums of Beverly Hills'' (1998), grew up with a car-salesman father obsessed with getting his children into the renowned schools of that tony Los Angeles suburb. That meant bouncing from apartment to apartment, often with an unpaid landlord in the family's wake.,''For someone like me, who didn't have things, the usual middle-class sitcoms created an anxiety, an inferiority complex,'' Ms. Jenkins says. ''With 'The Brady Bunch' I was fixated on the architecture; their house had an upstairs and a downstairs. I used to wonder, How did the people on the shows get that stuff -- couches, end tables, clothes? Because we had so much trouble accumulating stuff.'',She says she ''identified with the black sitcoms -- 'Good Times,' 'Sanford and Son' -- because those people were struggling.'',''I remember an episode when Fred Sanford was flying and had never been on a plane before and brought his own food. That was something I understood.'',When Ms. Jenkins ultimately put her experience onto film, not even her colleagues quite understood just how marginal suburban life could be. ''After shooting the interiors of the apartments, people got concerned it looked too depressing,'' she recalls. ''It was like, 'Oh, all the walls are so bare. Can't we put some color in there?' I'd told the production designer that these apartments are bare except for what the previous tenant left behind. They said, 'But it's a comedy.' I said, 'You read the script; poverty is not funny.' '',Eric Bogosian captured a similarly tenuous existence in his 1994 play ''Suburbia,'' which was later filmed by Richard Linklater. The characters, gathering nightly around a convenience store, have been through the military or menial jobs, and their sense of stunted horizons and vanished opportunities infuses several of the most dramatic scenes.,At one point, a high school classmate-turned-rock-star arrives at the convenience store in his limousine. One of the regulars, a former football star now drinking away his nights, starts to flirt with the musician's young publicity agent. ''You think we're alike, Erica?'' he asks. ''Deep down, way down,'' she answers. He fixes her in his stare and says, ''It's a mistake to think that.'',Later in ''Suburbia,'' a girl from the convenience-store group overdoses. The Pakistani manager, already exasperated by the ''drunks'' and ''bums'' on his property, cries: ''You people are so stupid! What's wrong with you? Throw it all away. You throw it all away.'',While Mr. Bogosian cites several influences on ''Suburbia'' -- the television show ''Roseanne'' and Donna Gaines's book about a plague of suburban suicides, ''Teen-Age Wasteland'' -- he drew primarily on his own past. Mr. Bogosian grew up as the son of a bookkeeper and a hairdresser in Woburn, Mass., the same blue-collar suburb of Boston that is the setting for the book, and now the film, ''A Civil Action.'',''I wasn't writing about 'The Other,' '' Mr. Bogosian says. ''I wasn't writing about the exotic. A lot of my experience in Woburn had to do with class. One of my best friends' fathers was a carpenter. Another was a truck driver. I had a friend whose father was a laborer, who'd come home from the job and lay on the couch and get drunk. We were being told in school that Woburn was a town to be proud of because it'd been a capital of shoe manufacturing in the 1890's. But we knew that was all gone. When I ran cross-country in high school, I went past all the empty factories.'',Immigrants like Junot Diaz have often inherited exactly such suburbs, and many of the short stories in ''Drown'' capture the social geography in meticulous detail. Mr. Diaz's characters live, as his actual family did, in a low-income apartment complex surrounded by the malls, cineplexes and municipal pools of the middle class. The autobiographical Yunior, as much as he is a bilingual and bicultural figure, does what so many Anglo suburban children before him have done: get car-sick on family trips to relatives in New York; take a boring job in the shapeless years after college; experiment with sex in the basement; waste afternoons smoking pot.,IN painting this milieu, Mr. Diaz came to realize his distance not only from the white chroniclers of suburban privilege but also from black and Hispanic writers who, like him, were reared outside the city. ''One of the things I see in an M.F.A. program is how many of the writers of color are from very middle-class backgrounds,'' says Mr. Diaz, who teaches at Syracuse University. ''But what they portray are low-income people. You can't begrudge anybody what they want to write about. But it shows that even writers are responding to pre-set notions of who 'we' are and how 'we' are supposed to be viewed.'',Nowhere may such self-abnegation be more pronounced than in rap music. Such bands and performers as EPMD, Public Enemy, Busta Rhymes and Boss were reared in suburbia but rarely if ever reflect it in their songs. The most extreme example, Ice Cube, spent much of his childhood in a Los Angeles suburb attending integrated schools and then a trade college. Yet he went on to fame for his gangsta raps celebrating drug deals, drive-by shootings and sexual conquests in the South-Central slums that his own family had labored to escape.,''Because hip-hop started off in the inner city, the street was the place where you had to get your pedigree,'' says S. H. Fernando Jr., a rap producer and the author of the social history ''The New Beats: Exploring the Music, Culture and Attitudes of Hip-Hop.'' ''You hear a lot of rappers saying, 'You have to represent' -- meaning represent the inner-city life style, the 'hood, even if you didn't come from it. The suburbs are seen as corny, bland, Middle America. Who wants to know about that?'',As if to answer that question, every Tuesday night several million viewers watch the ABC sitcom ''The Hughleys,'' the story of a middle-class black named Darryl Hughley who has just moved with his family into a mostly white suburb. The running gag of the show relies on Darryl's belief that his neighbor Dave is a closet bigot. ''The man does wear a lot of flannel,'' Darryl says to his wife in one episode, ''and he got those big belt buckles, too.'',The most trenchant moments come when Hughley himself, the owner of a vending-machine company, grapples with his fear that by moving his family out of a black, urban neighborhood he has compromised his racial identity and solidarity. ''You're on the slippery slope to lose your blackness,'' a friend from Los Angeles chides Darryl in the series pilot. Later in the episode, having watched his daughter choose a white doll rather than a black one in a toy store, Darryl moans, ''I feel like a stranger in a strange land.'',Yet that land surely looks stranger to the artists and audiences who remain stuck in the stock images of ''Beaver'' and Cheever than it possibly could to someone like Darryl Hughley, who is both a pioneer and a citizen of the new suburbia.",SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN,"FEB. 28, 1999",Suburbia Outgrows Its Image in the Arts,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/suburbia-outgrows-its-image-in-the-arts.html
"IT'S a bit like seeing the Plaza Hotel on Third Avenue or Grand Central on 57th Street. The huge statue of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center, which has rested in a sunken plaza since 1934, has been lifted up to street level while repairs are under way to the surrounding walls. Catch while you can this startling glimpse of one of New York's most famous objects in an unfamiliar spot -- the Greek god who delivered fire to humans will hold this pose for just a few months.,Rockefeller Center was an accident. John D. Rockefeller Jr. had leased the land for a new Metropolitan Opera complex, but when the stock market crash of 1929 forced the opera to bow out, Rockefeller sought a commercial development for the site. Some original elements of the earlier Metropolitan Opera design survived in the new project, including a new midblock north-south street and a central plaza.,At first circular and later rectangular, the sunken plaza was conceived as an entry point to a shopping concourse underneath 30 Rockefeller Plaza. A central circular fountain was meant to draw pedestrians down a broad stairway and lead them to the retailers.,By early 1933 this design had evolved to a fountain with a sculpture against the west wall, and Paul Manship was hired as the sculptor. Born in Minnesota in 1885, Manship left high school at age 17, convinced that his future lay in art. He came to New York and worked for Isidore Konti in 1908 while Konti was at work on the facade sculpture of the Gainsborough Studios at 222 Central Park South.,Manship then went out on his own, and his muscular, active figures brought him instant fame at his inaugural exhibition in 1912. He quickly developed a reputation as a reliable artist who could work on schedule without histrionics. A 1918 portrait bust of John D. Rockefeller Sr. in the collection of the Rockefeller Archive Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., was rendered in his typical cool, unemotional style, and by the 1920's Manship was the designer of choice for public sculpture projects -- he designed the 1933 inaugural medal for Franklin D. Roosevelt.,For the plaza, Manship decided on the theme of Prometheus. He apparently developed the design in his row-house/studio complex at 319 East 72d Street, created for the sculptor by the modernist architect Eric Gugler in 1925. The finished figure had the stylized hair and blank expression of ancient Greek sculpture that was Manship's trademark. But it also had Manship's typical emphasis on lithe movement.,INSTALLED in early 1934, the eight-ton bronze sculpture had Prometheus flying almost horizontally, with a clump of fire in his right hand, through streams of water over a zodiacal ring. Edward Alden Jewel, writing in The New York Times, called Prometheus ''a genuine masterpiece, beautiful in its rhythm.'' But he acknowledged that another critic, the actor and writer Frank Craven, considered it ''a boudoir knickknack.'' Manship's unhindered success inspired detractors who saw in him an upper-class toady irrelevant to the dead-serious modernism of the 1930's.,Prometheus was originally gilt to a bright finish, but in mid-1934 Jewell wrote in The Times that the gilding had been radically toned down, a change he considered a mistake. ''For a few weeks,'' he wrote, ''the Prometheus was the blithest note in the town's vast architectural scale.'',Indeed, Manship had many reservations about the completed work. He thought he had been hurried by the 12-month schedule, and the horizontal figure of Prometheus was not consonant with the verticality of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. ''I'd naturally welcome the opportunity of doing the whole fountain group over again,'' he told Rockefeller Center Weekly in 1935.,On reflection, he thought that two huge columns, or two 50-foot-high standing figures, would have been better.,Prometheus, although striking, failed to draw enough shoppers down to the plaza, and in 1936 a skating rink was installed and the surrounding shops were converted to restaurants, a much more successful arrangement.,Since then Prometheus has endured regildings, skating lessons and tourists' picture-taking -- surely the skating rink and its sculpture are among New York City's most popular tourist destinations.,But now Prometheus has been lifted up to Rockefeller Plaza, and the entire west wall of the sunken plaza has been taken apart to the raw steel. According to Richard Metsky, the partner in charge at Beyer Blinder Belle architects, the continually wet environment of the fountain caused the wall to deteriorate to the point that its granite blocks were displaced by several inches.,With the approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the wall is being rebuilt, reusing the original granite, while the giant golden figure surveys the scene from its unfamiliar spot. When the statue returns to its place overlooking the skating rink it will be flanked by a new set of doors that will ultimately lead to the center's underground shopping concourse, which is undergoing a major renovation.,Geoffrey P. Wharton, senior managing director of Tishman Speyer Properties, the center's manager and part owner, said that Prometheus would be regilt and lowered to its original level by early summer.",CHRISTOPHER GRAY,"FEB. 28, 1999","Streetscapes / Rockefeller Center; Prometheus Rises, for Now, From Rink to Street",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/streetscapes-rockefeller-center-prometheus-rises-for-now-from-rink-to-street.html

"IT'S how most golfers decide who wins or loses a few dollars. It's called match play, with the accent on match because it's more pressure than play.,It's scored hole by hole, meaning you can win, say, 2 and 1 because you're two holes ahead with only one hole remaining, as opposed to stroke play or medal play, meaning a round, say, of par 72 over 18 holes, the usual weekly PGA Tour format.,But match play is used so seldom in pro tournaments worldwide that the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship here at La Costa Resort and Spa has been a seminar for the pros in this unfamiliar format where anything can happen. And has.,It's a format more physically draining than the usual weekly 72-hole event, but virtually all of the pros have talked about how match play is even more mentally draining.,All except Andrew Magee, who now would seem to have a psychological edge on Jeff Maggert, at least before they tee off in today's 36-hole final for the $1 million jackpot.,''I'm not drained at all,'' Magee said, after disposing of John Huston, 3 and 1, in his 18-hole semifinal. ''Hey, this is a spa. I take a little steam, lay back and relax.'',Maggert, who rallied to eliminate Steve Pate, 1 up, in his semifinal, sounded just the opposite, acknowledging that his six previous matches had ''taken its toll'' on his concentration as well as his stamina.,''I'm tired,'' Maggert said. ''I was hitting balls this morning and I was thinking, it seems like I've been here for a month. In match play, you've got to be ready like it's Sunday afternoon of a normal tournament.'',Tiger Woods discovered that.,''Physically, I feel great, but mentally, I'm pretty tired,'' Woods, the world's No. 1-ranked player, said upon losing to Maggert, 2 and 1, after defeating Stewart Cink, 2 and 1, in Friday's double round. ''I put everything I had into both matches and there just wasn't enough left, I guess, in the afternoon.'',For the pros, this first of the three World Golf Championships events this year has been a seminar in match-play philosophy.,''Your strategy on a hole is really determined by what your opponent is doing,'' Nick Price said after ousting Frankie Minoza of the Philippines, 4 and 3, in the first round. ''We had a perfect example on the fifth hole where my drive finished in the first cut of rough and he drove it in the bunker.,''He hit a great shot just short of the green. I pulled my second shot into the bunker, then hit it up 10 feet and missed the putt. He had a 5-footer to make, but he missed it.,''It looked like I was going to win the hole off the tee shot, then it looked even, then he looked like he was going to win it, but he missed the putt. That is something you have to deal with all the time. Normally in match play, someone who is a steady player always seems to do well. Doesn't get too emotional.'',In other words, whether you're up or down in the match, don't get too up or too down emotionally.,''Our whole game has always been based on four rounds and consistency and keeping your cool, playing through your bad patches,'' Price said. ''But here you can't play through your bad patches. Here you might lose three or four holes and you are done.'',Just as Price was down when he lost to Maggert, 1 up, with a bogey on the 18th hole in the second round. Mano a mano seldom occurs in golf.,''I don't know the tennis tour that well,'' Phil Mickelson said after eliminating Lee Janzen, 2 and 1, in the second round, ''but I think it would be very difficult to have good friends in tennis because it is such a win-or-lose situation. Lee and I are great friends and yet, to be put in this situation, it's difficult.'',In the weekly PGA Tour events, dozens of pros can feel they played well.,''Here it's more cutthroat,'' Mickelson said. ''It is either you win or you lose. So because we are not used to that, it's difficult for some of the players to deal with.'',Even before the match play began, David Duval sounded as if he knew he would have trouble adjusting.,''I've worked so hard to get accustomed to using 72 holes to win a golf tournament and that takes some adjustment; at least it did for me,'' Duval, the No. 2-ranked player, said. ''And now you're facing a week where you don't have that and you could get beaten very easily.'',Duval was one under par through 17 holes in Thursday's second round but lost, 2 and 1, to Bill Glasson, who was three under.,Another element of match play is the conceded putt, which never occurs in stroke play because every golfer's ball must be holed out. But not every short putt is conceded, not even for a halved hole. Even with a 5-up lead on the 13th green, Craig Stadler didn't concede Colin Montgomerie's three-foot putt for a halve.,''Last thing you want to do,'' Stadler said, ''is give it to him and he birdies the last five. There is no love lost in match play.'',And after today's 36-hole final, all but one of the world's top 64 golfers will have lost in what has amounted to a match-play seminar.",DAVE ANDERSON,"FEB. 28, 1999",Sports of The Times; Mentally Drained by Format?

"WHEN the Yankees made their deal for Roger Clemens 10 days ago, there was a surprising amount of grumbling from hard-core fans who had been captivated by the way David Wells took to New York.,Just about everybody agreed it was a good baseball move, but there was a third angle to the deal -- whether the oft-cantankerous Clemens would run afoul of intrusive fans and news media in New York. It is a reasonable question.,Noo Yawkers are a sensitive breed. Tom Seaver did a radio interview with Chris Russo a few weeks ago and the WFAN switchboard was soon jangling with aggrieved locals very quick to volunteer, ''Hey, Mad Dawg, the guy copped an attitude with you.'',They can sniff out haughtiness in a Manhattan minute. I suspect it might not be a pretty sight if Hillary Clinton, who has never run for anything, is exposed to vox populi asking why she thinks she should be a Senator in a state where she has never lived, or to questions even more pointed and personal.,Even Mickey Mantle, who ultimately became a folk hero, once admitted that as a young player he had not understood what fans in Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park were shouting at him. It wasn't the accents, but rather that the quips and puns and insults were often flying right over his crimson neck.,Now it is Roger Clemens who will be tested. The big dude from Texas has come to New York to acquire his World Series ring. That's nice. We have a very nice jewelry area on West 47th Street. However, Clemens would prefer to have a club official do the shopping and present him with some ostentatious championship ring.,By his body of work and his strong ego -- and the way he has accepted ritual teasing about beanballs past -- Clemens does not seem a candidate to become the next Eddie Whitson. Yankee fans remember Whitson, whose modest talent disintegrated in 1985 when the fabled Bronx Men's Chorus performing their Bleacherian Chants turned him into vertical hummus. He lasted a season and a half.,Clemens must know that New Yorkers do not pull their punches for superstars. Mets fans had no mercy for Mike Piazza, his eyes as bewildered as those of a stag in the middle of the Interstate, trying to make sense of what he was doing in Shea Stadium last May.,To his credit, Piazza had the skill and the courage to bounce back, with doubles off outfield fences. Take that. Piazza, who has since signed on for extended duty, accepts the hypocrisy, and more power to him.,Not that New York is the only town to give the cold shoulder to outsiders. It cannot be easy to be Jose Offerman moving to Boston right after the Red Sox squandered their hold on Mo Vaughn. It wasn't easy for Charles Johnson trying to catch for the Dodgers last year after the Murdoch henchmen banished Piazza. And in Philadelphia, the assassins on WIP make the screechers on WFAN sound like National Public Radio.,For some stars, New York becomes like the sports car for people who hit certain milepost birthdays, the present to oneself. Mark Messier exuded so much chesty confidence that it was no surprise he led the Rangers to a Stanley Cup. The Rangers are not so wonderful these days, but there is something reassuring about Wayne Gretzky (temporarily injured) gliding up and down the Garden ice, a long-standing hit like ''Cats.'',Some athletes bring their own wall with them. As long as he has played here, Patrick Ewing remains a Washington guy, loved and respected but with somewhat less emotion than for Charles Oakley, with his surly physicality, or John Starks, with his chest-thumping unpredictability. It's a gut thing, like Jimmy Connors playing cock-of-the-walk at the United States Open.,Sometimes athletes come to New York because it is just another stop on the merry-go-round. Kerry Collins, the troubled quarterback who signed that improbably huge contract, will soon discover that Giants fans expect him to be Conerly, Tittle and Simms, every sequence.,Some athletes avoid New York altogether. Greg Maddux knew his workmanlike steadiness would play better in Atlanta than New York. Albert Belle is bright enough to know he did not want to hear New York's psychologists, real and amateur, counseling him inning by inning.,My guess is that Clemens will not go through the trauma that Piazza suffered. He is joining a great team. He does not play every day. He will have had all spring to prepare. He is a master at controlling his own universe. His glare keeps the pests away. When he strides to the mound, he is ready.,Roger Clemens will have a lot of big leads in Yankee Stadium. It will bring out the inner bully, the athlete's instinct that says ''Kick 'em while they're down.'' Jordan had it. Messier had it. Lawrence Taylor had it. A great pitcher on the Yankees can afford confidence. A tourist carrying a lot of heavy luggage running for the Senate? That is another ball game. We are not rubes, and we are not shy.",GEORGE VECSEY,"FEB. 28, 1999",Sports of The Times; Fun City a Struggle For Out-of-Towners,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-fun-city-a-struggle-for-out-of-towners.html
"ACROSS the state, the Yankees steel themselves for their title defense in a bustling big-league city, down the boulevard from a cluster of strip clubs. Here, with nothing in sight except a handful of neat, low-slung strip malls, the Mets quietly train for the storm of expectation that awaits them in New York.,''Now I know what to expect,'' Mike Piazza said the other day, sitting shirtless at his dressing stall in the middle of the clubhouse. He -- like Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla -- is a rare Met who does know what it is to step into the New York baseball season and be counted on to immediately perform with a post-season strut. He may be the only Met who has actually confronted the jury of sneering critics and made them blink and eventually smile.,''Before we start thinking about competing with the Yankees, we've got to worry about our own division,'' Piazza said. ''But it's true, the owners here spent the money on the free agents. They've committed themselves to winning. They're giving it a shot.'',It is not yet March, but already the buzz for the Mets has begun. The general manager, Steve Phillips, talks about the electricity in the clubhouse, and admits they can no longer cling to the security blanket of being that ''nice little team.'' Atlanta has already lost Andres Galarraga. Houston did not re-sign Randy Johnson, and Moises Alou is down for the year. The Padres thanked the city of San Diego for agreeing to build them a new stadium by surrendering the core of their National League champions. Here is what this means for the Mets, who are chock full of returnees and additions: Anything less than the wild card will be perceived, given the expenditures and all that comes with them, a considerable flop.,''This is a really good team,'' Bobby Valentine said in the manager's office.,He was asked if it was the best team, at least on paper, he had ever managed.,''I don't have all the lineups,'' he said, opting out of that loaded question in a hurry.,Valentine has never had the luxury of oiling a winning machine like Joe Torre's Yankees, but he has never made the playoffs with some above-average talent either. He can be thin-skinned about that, and he has a strange habit of blowing a small controversy into a Kansas cyclone, so it is not unfair to wonder how Valentine will hold up in the heat.,Some managers and coaches have excellent careers in the comfort zone of steering bad teams to respectability. It is entirely another task, psychologically and otherwise, when management hands you an expensive payroll, pats you on the back and informs you, in so many words, that it has already factored post-season revenue into its fiscal budget.,''We put together a wish list and were able to get everyone on it,'' Phillips said.,In the ideal season, the Mets believe themselves capable of mounting a challenge to the Braves. In the more realistic setting, they are carrying the playoffs-now burden with a pitching staff that contains no dominant starters, questionable depth in the back end of the rotation and an aging, vulnerable closer. They could easily find themselves in another wild-card race, under more extreme pressure this time to win it.,''The chances are that there are going to be ups and downs, some difficult times,'' Piazza said. He wanted to make it clear that while he is brimming with personal confidence, anticipating numbers as good as any he produced in Los Angeles, one player cannot carry a team. He feels ready, though, to shoulder a different load, assume the role for which he underwent on-the-spot training last summer.,Early on, under $100 million expectations, he didn't hit, as advertised, but he took the city's best shots, and came back swinging. Came back to at least carry the Mets into the playoff chase.,''The best thing that happened for me was that I was force-fed into that kind of situation last season, dealing with that blue-collar baseball mentality New York has,'' Piazza said. ''I'd never experienced anything like that. There was some criticism in L.A., but, really, out there it was like I could do no wrong.,''I'm not going to say last summer was easy, because there was so much change, some tough times. But I couldn't have planned it any better, the way it worked out. I feel good about the fact that I hung in there. I think New Yorkers can appreciate that. I feel more ready now to try to not only get into the playoffs, but lift my team once I get there, which, for whatever reasons, I wasn't able to do in L.A.'',He wisely offers no guarantees, but makes this promise: ''After last season, after facing some things as an athlete and a person that I never had to before, I can't imagine I'll ever be afraid to fail.'',In the same soft-spoken way, he sounded like David Cone, who, pitching for the Mets or the Yanks, has hunkered down right in Manhattan, looked New York right in the eye. After checking out the suburbs, Piazza has kept his apartment on the Upper East Side.,Down here in Port St. Lucie, in the midst of open space, curious retirees and gentle ocean breezes, he prepares for April, for chillier days, for the big-city storm that comes for New York's teams that dare to contend.",HARVEY ARATON,"FEB. 28, 1999","Sports of The Times; Amid the Mets' Buzz, A Need to Contend",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-amid-the-mets-buzz-a-need-to-contend.html

"After nearly 10 years at CBS, Paula Zahn quit without qualms, she said, to  join Fox News, the fledgling 24-hour cable news channel, where she will anchor the main news at 7 P.M. starting tomorrow. The idea of leaving may have taken root when the 1996 Presidential votes were being tallied. Ms. Zahn recalled sitting in the newsroom with colleagues ''feeling badly that we were all relegated to our broadcast with election results when our cable brethren were on the air live with a five-hour block of time.'',''Our industry is changing so quickly that it became abundantly clear to me that I wasn't going to be able to do the kind of live television work I wanted to do on network television,'' Ms. Zahn said. ''The hours simply aren't available. So when Fox approached me with the opportunity to do two hours of live television a day, I jumped.'',At the time, she was doing one half-hour a week, as the anchor of ''CBS Evening News Saturday Edition,'' and  was backup anchor for Dan Rather on the evening news. She said she had missed ''the daily adrenaline rush'' of her previous, six-year stint as co-host of ''CBS This Morning.'',Ms. Zahn also contributed to ''48 Hours,'' ''CBS News Sunday Morning,'' specials and documentaries. Before CBS she was at ABC for more than two years.,At the Fox News Channel, a two-year-old unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, she will anchor ''The Fox Report,'' from 7 to 8 P.M., the only prime-time slot that had not yet been permanently assigned. In a couple of weeks she will also be the host for an hour of the daylong report known as ''Fox News Now.'',Ms. Zahn's audience, of course, will be far smaller than that of CBS. But, she noted, Fox News is growing. It's now available to 38 million viewers, up from 28 million a year ago. ''The only growth in the news industry is at the cable level, '' she said. ''I think over a period of time, the cable numbers will grow dramatically.'',Her new boss, Roger Ailes, chairman of Fox News, said Ms. Zahn fit Fox perfectly, as ''a very good interviewer'' who is ''fair and balanced in her approach.'' And something else: she's not an ''arrogant network anchor stiff shirt.'' Mr. Ailes said that there was an old-fashioned, traditional ''Good evening, 'I'm the anchor and you're not'  approach at the broadcast networks, and that's one of the reasons they're losing audiences.'',Newer-fashioned cable, he contends,  offers ''a much more direct, audience-friendly dialogue with viewers'' exemplified by Ms. Zahn. ''She is very much the same off the air as she is on the air,'' he added.,Born in Omaha, Ms. Zahn, 43, received a B.A. degree in journalism from Stephens College in Columbia, Mo., attending on a cello scholarship. (She occasionally played the instrument on the CBS morning show and elsewhere, but hasn't been able to really keep in practice, she said.) After television news jobs in Dallas, San Diego, Houston, Boston and Los Angeles, she returned to the Boston area to marry Richard Cohen, a real estate developer (they have three young children), and joined ABC News, commuting to Washington.,A self-described sports fanatic who finds time to run, race, bicycle ''seriously'' and play softball, Ms. Zahn cited her role as co-host of the Winter Olympics in 1992 and 1994 among highlights of her work.

"Shirley Stoler, an actress best known for her role as the Nazi commandant in Lina Wertmuller's 1976 film ''Seven Beauties,'' died on Feb. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.,The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her brother Ira.,Ms. Stoler, a native of Brooklyn whose acting career spanned four decades, considered herself the first significantly fat actress to do dramatic roles rather than comedy. Her weight, which hovered around 250 pounds in her early years, limited her choices, she said in a 1976 interview with The New York Times. ''Weight shouldn't be a hindrance, but casting people are afraid of it,'' she said. ''I could play 'Medea,' but they wouldn't cast me for it.'',Her imposing figure frequently landed Ms. Stoler the part of the villain or shrew, most notably in ''Seven Beauties,'' in which she played the sadistic commandant of a Nazi concentration camp to critical acclaim. Six years earlier, in Leonard Kastle's ''Honeymoon Killers,''  she played a predatory nurse executed for murder. Her film credits  also include ''The Deer Hunter'' and ''Klute.'',Ms. Stoler appeared on Broadway as Lolita's mother in Edward Albee's 1981 stage adaptation of the Nabokov novel. She played villainous roles on many television series.,In addition to her brother Ira, of Fairfield, Conn., she is survived by another brother, David, of Wanaque, N.J., and a sister, Miriam, of Delray Beach, Fla.",,"FEB. 28, 1999","Shirley Stoler, 69, Actress Hailed For Her Role in 'Seven Beauties'",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/shirley-stoler-69-actress-hailed-for-her-role-in-seven-beauties.html
"BEFORE the first humans came, when Long Island was just a rubbed raw slice of terra firma freshly carved by glaciers, a great granite boulder came to rest in what would one day be Manhasset.,The rock had not traveled far and was probably plucked from bedrock somewhere in what is now the Bronx or Westchester. The boulder, now known as Shelter Rock, was dragged southeast in an ice sheet with uncounted other glacial erratics, the name geologists give these bulky travelers that would never be on Long Island but for glacial transport.,The boulder came to rest in what is now a corner of Greentree, the Whitney Family estate founded in 1903, where development never intruded.,It is there today behind a double fence, mostly unnoticed and hazardous to reach, not 50 yards from the passing traffic on Shelter Rock Road, a 5-million-pound chunk of granite that is so hard that 20 millennia have barely left a mark.,Now, one year after the death of  Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, as the family-controlled Greentree Foundation ponders what to do with the 450-acre estate in an unincorporated area of Manhasset, there are new concerns about Shelter Rock.,Will it become a public monument, a landmark and accessible to all? Will it disappear beyond a security booth, the centerpiece of a high-end housing development that takes its name? Will it remain in a far corner of a private estate, unadvertised and seen only by those who seek it out? Will modern rock-crushing machines make short work of it? Or will it merely be forgotten?,In geologic time, the answers may be only nanoseconds away.,Thousands of glacial erratics of varying sizes line Long Island's north shore and lie scattered inland, according to Robert J. Kalin, a professor of geology at Suffolk County Community College.,''Most of them are unheralded, unmarked, unrenowned in any way,'' Mr. Kalin said. ''But they are elements of the topography that were there from the retreat of the glacier, and they are permanent features in the historic record of Long Island.'',Erratics further east on Long Island are from Connecticut, while those in western Nassau probably came from the vicinity of the Bronx and Westchester, said Herbert D. Mills, curator of geology for the Nassau County Division of Museums. All arrived ancient, from 450 million to more than a billion years old, he said.,Some, like Target Rock on Huntington Bay, are linked to lore. British troops occupying Long Island during the Revolutionary War were said to have used it for target practice. Others, like the five-boulder train at Camp Quinipet, a church camp on Shelter Island, are carved with names: Love, Faith, Courage, Humility and Honesty.,In Southampton, a pint-sized glacial erratic at Conscience Point known as Settlers Rock bears a plaque commemorating the arrival of the first English settlers in June, 1640, who, like the rock, came down from the north.,A submerged rock giant a mile and a half off Montauk Point scoured the hull of a passing ship in 1862 and has been heeded ever since by captains. In the Manorville hills, a glacial erratic is the pedestal for a statute of Mary at the Shrine of Our Lady of Long Island.,Other glacial erratics were quarried or, if they were in farm fields, dynamited. ''A lot of these rocks met their doom by simply being blown up,'' said Gaynell Stone, the director of museum programs for the Suffolk County Archeological Society. ''Farmers didn't like to plow around things.'',But for its 55-foot-high, 35-foot-wide size and the overhanging ledge that gave it a name, Shelter Rock is both the largest and best known of Long Island's glacial erratics.,Joan G. Kent, the North Hempstead town historian and a member of the town's landmarks preservation commission, said that when she was a child growing up in Munsey park during the 1930s, she and friends sometimes rode bicycles to the rock.,''We would sit under the ledge and say, 'Boy, we're doing just what the Indians used to do,' '' she said. Indeed, historians and geologists believe the natural shelter that the overhang offered made it a perfect place to camp and light a fire whose heat would radiate off the rock face. The Manhasset area was inhabited by the Matinecocks.,''It's rumored as long as I've been around that Indians camped there,'' Mr. Mills said. ''And my recollection is that Indian artifacts were found there.'',But what was easy access to the rock in the 1930's, when Shelter Rock Road was a winding country lane, has since diminished. Today, the road is a high-speed, four-lane connector from the Long Island Expressway to Miracle Mile and Manhasset. Only the sharpest eyes will spot a roadside sign posted by the town announcing the rock's partially obscured presence.,Reaching the rock requires a dash across the road to the double fence behind which the rock sits. A culvert between the fences is littered with leaves and lightly coated with paper trash. Within, the rock's sheltered face is visible, as are efforts to black out graffiti on it.,The Greentree Foundation does not allow visitors inside the fences except for specially arranged tours by boy scouts, school children and other small groups. ''As I am sure you can appreciate, this is a private residence,'' said Bonny J. Forest, the vice president and senior adviser to the Greentree Foundation.,Miss Forrest said the Greentree Foundation was ''considering uses for the property, but no decision have been made.,''Certainly the rock is part of the process,'' she said. ''We are trying to be thoughtful and not make any hasty decisions.'',Greentree was one of several homes owned by John Hay Whitney, who inherited one of America's great fortunes, Ambassador to England, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune, pool player, philanthropist and financier.,One year after Mr. Whitney's death in 1982, Betsey Whitney, his wife, established the Greentree Foundation to benefit local community groups, serving as its president. After her death at 89 in March, control of the foundation passed to her two daughters and a family lawyer.,Miss Forest said last week the foundation had ''no plans to sell foundation property at the moment.'' But paintings, furnishings and other items from the Greentree mansion and four other Whitney homes, with an estimated worth of $80 million to $110 million, are to be sold at Sotheby's in auctions in April and May.,The rock will not feel the gavel, but could face uncertainty if the Greentree property is sold. During the past 20 years, developments of expensive attached and detached houses have swept down Shelter Rock Road.,''There are a lot of developers who wouldn't give up one house to preserve an environmental rarity,'' said Richard L. Amper Jr., the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society.,Frank J. Turano, a lecturer in Long Island natural history and human ecology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said glacial erratics like Shelter Rock deserved protection.,''They are permanent points of reference,'' he said. ''No matter how much the landscape changes, you can still go back and see these rocks and orient yourself to past experiences.''",JOHN RATHER,"FEB. 28, 1999",Shelter Rock Facing an Uncertain Future,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/shelter-rock-facing-an-uncertain-future.html
"THE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP TRADITION,Moral Vision From Washington to Clinton.,By Marvin Olasky.,Illustrated. 298 pp. New York:,The Free Press. $25.,PICK out any 20th-century President and imagine if you actually had to live with him for a month. Teddy Roosevelt would bore you to death with his endless dinner soliloquies, and then drive you crazy by bouncing around the house at odd hours. Lyndon Johnson would lean over you four inches from your face and tell dirty jokes up your nose. Ronald Reagan would regale you with amusing stories, but after three weeks of intimate contact you still wouldn't be sure if he knew your name. The fact is that our Presidents have ranged from the disgraceful to the heroic, but almost none of them were actually normal human beings. And when you think about it, how could they be, given the freakish sort of life one has to lead just to get into that job?,So most of us don't choose a President the way we choose a spouse or a friend. But Marvin Olasky believes that is exactly how we should select our Presidents. Olasky, whose earlier book ''The Tragedy of American Compassion'' powerfully influenced conservative views on welfare reform, believes good husbands usually make good Presidents, and bad husbands usually make bad Presidents. In ''The American Leadership Tradition: Moral Vision From Washington to Clinton,'' he profiles 13 American leaders (not all of them Presidents), from Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln through to Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. In each of his brief biographical sketches Olasky attempts to show that there is a powerful link between personal behavior and public performance.,The book is littered, therefore, with sentences in which Olasky is laboring, sometimes desperately, to connect the personal to the political. Of his hero Andrew Jackson, Olasky writes, ''Jackson's willingness to put aside immediate gratification and fight for long-term satisfactions came to the fore during the biggest fight of his Presidency, the battle over the Second Bank of the United States.'' Of Henry Clay, one of his villains, Olasky writes, ''Clay went on to treat particular constitutional clauses as he treated Washington women of easy virtue.'' In his harsh portrait of John Kennedy, Olasky writes, ''Kennedy emphasized fast action, whether sexual or governmental.'',When you skip ahead to note that the final chapter is on Bill Clinton, you can see where this is headed. But this book is more than just an effort to persuade readers that Clinton's infidelity makes him a bad President. Olasky's work is part of the broad effort by many religious conservatives to develop a public theology. Their goal is to help believers use their religious principles to inform their political decisions, but in a way that is consistent with pluralistic democracy. Olasky, who is also the editor of World, a weekly Christian news magazine, wants people to see that they don't have to check their religious understandings at the voting booth curtain.,Unfortunately, ''The American Leadership Tradition'' doesn't even come close to offering a sophisticated public theology. Instead, it unwittingly illustrates how misleading it can be to mix the personal with the political. And Olasky's historical judgments are so crude and pinched that one suspects his main effect will be to buttress the stereotypes of those who are prejudiced against religious conservatives.,Olasky's first problem is that he has decided to judge his subjects on two criteria, how they ''worshiped God'' and ''whether and how they were able to keep their lusts under control.'' Nobody denies that faith and sex are important parts of people's lives. But if you write biographical sketches centered on these matters, then you are likely to produce distorted versions of history.,In his profile of George Washington, for example, Olasky has a little account of the American Revolution. And in this version, the British lost largely because their leaders couldn't keep their pants on. Gen. Sir William Howe ''was absorbed in adultery with his mistress.'' John Montagu, First Lord of the Admiralty, was a gambler who loved pornographic shrubbery (trimmed to resemble genitalia). George Sackville, Secretary of State for the land war, was promiscuously gay and appointed homosexuals to key posts. One suspects that these matters were not nearly so central to the fate of the Revolution as Olasky makes them out to be.,Similarly, in Olasky's version of Franklin Roosevelt's Presidency, Lucy Mercer, Roosevelt's mistress, and Missy LeHand, his private secretary, have major roles, but Harry Hopkins is barely mentioned. Olasky even describes the Cuban missile crisis as essentially about sex: ''The emotional detachment Kennedy showed in using women as he did made him a fine cold war poker player. He could coldly go to the brink of nuclear war without being unnerved by a normal man's sensitivities.'',The reader is left in a strange, through-the-looking-glass world in which what leaders do in the pew and the motel room determines what they do in office. It's a world in which Abraham Lincoln is treated coolly because his faith is too ''fatalistic'' for Olasky. It's a world in which leaders who agree with Olasky's fiscal and free trade positions are cut a lot of moral slack, but those who disagree with them are viewed harshly. And it's a world in which Ronald Reagan almost doesn't exist. I was looking forward to seeing how Olasky would square Reagan's private behavior -- he rarely attended church and was an inattentive father -- with his public accomplishments. But Olasky glides over Reagan.,Furthermore, whatever insights Olasky might have wrung out of his approach are obliterated by his censoriousness. For while he puts his heroes -- Washington, Jackson, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt -- on pedestals, he portrays his villains as something close to vermin. Daniel Webster gets tossed aside as ''brandy's poster boy,'' and even a figure as enigmatic as Jefferson is flogged relentlessly, as if he were some unidimensional cutout.,For example, while Jefferson was Ambassador to France he developed an infatuation for a 27-year-old married woman, Maria Cosway. In his 1997 biography of Jefferson, ''American Sphinx,'' Joseph J. Ellis describes their friendship as a complicated and emotionally fraught episode in Jefferson's life, which illuminated the struggle between Jefferson's romantic sentimentality and his cold rationalism. Ellis concludes, by the way, that the two probably never had sex. But all nuance and thoughtful analysis are absent from Olasky's account, which portrays the Jefferson-Cosway relationship as a cheap and tawdry affair. ''Jefferson weighed the possibility of political embarrassment and venereal disease against generous and pleasurable spasms,'' Olasky writes.,''The Tragedy of American Compassion'' was a sophisticated disquisition on the uses and abuses of tender feelings, so it is curious to find Olasky so dismissive here. But conservatives who read this book will experience an odder sensation, that of seeing their political preferences being advanced by radically left-wing means. It was the New Left, after all, that made famous the phrase ''the personal is political.'' Conservatives have tended to defend the wall between public and private. Those on the right have traditionally stood for reticence and modesty over self-exposure, believing that personal emotions are destroyed if they're exposed to the glare of publicity, and that good private intentions often don't lead to good public outcomes. That's why conservatives tend to be so put off by the whole Oprah culture of maximum openness, and by Al Gore's appalling use of his sister's death in his 1996 Democratic National Convention speech.,BUT here is Olasky arguing that, indeed, the personal is a key to the political. And if we follow his logic, far from insisting on public reticence, we have a responsibility to expose the private lives of our Presidential candidates. Only by knowing their faith and fidelity records can we evaluate their leadership potential. Maybe we should make them fill out sexual disclosure forms to go with their financial disclosure forms. And perhaps we are in fact headed in that direction. Already in this Presidential election cycle, candidates are being asked if they have committed adultery, and it is the most conservative candidates who are gleefully answering the question!,One finishes this book longing for a sophisticated public theology that doesn't take us down this path. Because if Olasky's suppositions distort the past, imagine what they will do to the future.",DAVID BROOKS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Sexual Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/sexual-politics.html

"IN Colonial America, fortunetelling was against the law. It still is in New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. But in New Jersey, the age of Puritanism has given way to the New Age.,Sort through your junk mail, and among the coupons for pizzerias, electrical contractors and landscapers you may find one for a reading by a psychic, offering to ''help you see the light and answer the questions you've been searching for.'',What many skeptics consider a questionable pursuit is, in fact, a bona fide business enterprise. Well, bona fide may be a stretch in some cases, but marketing oneself as a professional psychic is hardly illegal.,Indeed, it is nearly impossible to drive down the main street of any town in New Jersey without -- excuse the expression -- seeing a sign, often in neon, advertising a psychic's services. Some may call themselves advisers, others spiritual advisers. Many have been in the same locations for years, suggesting that business is thriving.,''We have put on the glass slipper, and it fits,'' said Jean Munzer of Oakland, director of the Metaphysical Center of New Jersey. ''It is a respectable career.'',And psychic fairs flourish, at shopping malls or as charitable events for organizations like the American Red Cross. Some are conducted under the auspices of the Metaphysical Center, said Ms. Munzer, which was founded in 1956 and has about 500 members. In addition, the center sponsors lectures at William Paterson College in Wayne the first and third Saturday of every month from September through June, and many adult schools offer courses in palmistry and tarot card reading.,So just how many psychics are there in New Jersey? Everyone who lives in the state, the professionals say, since they believe everyone has psychic abilities. How many are in the business? Hundreds, maybe thousands; no form of licensing or certification is required, and no count is kept by the state government, the Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau or the Metaphysical Center.,How many are truly talented? ''Fifty to a hundred,'' estimated 100,'' said Nancy Orlen Weber, a practicing psychic in Denville. Most do not practice full time; one psychic practices secretly because her husband opposes anything even remotely connected with the occult.,People turn to psychics probably for the same reason they have for millenniums: for help with their problems, most often related to love or money, said MaryAnne Alvaro of Global Psychics, an international group of practicing psychics and entrepreneurs based in Toronto.,While many clients believe in the paranormal, others go to psychics as they would to wise and trusted friends, therapists or ministers. And they come from every socio-economic stratum: ''politicians and welfare mothers, stockbrokers and truck drivers,'' Ms. Alvaro said.,Some clients do it for fun. ''Parties, charitable events and business conferences often feature psychics as part of the entertainment,'' Ms. Alvaro said. ''Guests can often have several readings done by different psychics on the same day or evening and compare the results.'',Another reason is ''the opportunity to reveal problems and secrets to someone who will listen empathically and offer advice or direction,'' Ms. Alvaro said. ''Since this advice does not have the imprimatur of a physician or a traditionally trained therapist or minister, the client hasn't invested a great deal of time or money and may easily choose to ignore it. It, thus, offers a non-threatening solution to a problem.'',For many reputable psychics, money, they say, is hardly a priority; most insist they go into the field to help others. Few do readings full time; rather, they support themselves by alternate means in fields like nursing, psychotherapy and massage. They also offer other kinds of help: some New Jersey psychics volunteer to help police detectives locate missing persons or criminals; some work with animal rescue squads to find lost pets.,Their methods vary, but what many psychics have in common are great people skills: they appear gentle, open and welcoming, and they love to talk and listen.,ROSE VERNON,A 'Straight Psychic,' Without Props,Rose Vernon of Clark had an Italian grandmother who, she said, could ''see things'' and would ''cast incantations against the evil eye.'' But as a child, Rose, born in Camden and reared in Newark, never imagined that she, too, would become a psychic. She married, had children and ran an industrial cleaning business for years before she emerged as a clairvoyant.,It came about 30 years ago through a customer, an astrologer who told her he believed she had great psychic abilities and would be engaged in this kind of work within 10 years. Ms. Vernon was intrigued, studied astrology for 10 years and has now been practicing astrology and other metaphysical disciplines, like reading palms, tarot cards and runes, for more than two decades. ''The cards and other things are only tools,'' said Ms. Vernon, who calls herself ''a straight psychic.'',''I don't need props,'' she said. ''I see auras. The tools help my clients relax and open up to me.'',She has worked with police departments on missing persons cases, participated in psychic fairs and does readings at parties and bridal showers. And she says she has numerous clients, both men and women, many of whom have remained loyal through her career. ''Men's questions tend to be business issues, while women usually ask about love,'' she said. Her clients range in age from their 20's to their 80's.,''When you do a reading, most people know the answers deep down in their hearts,'' she said. ''The rest is confirmation.'' What happens when she sees problems ahead? ''I'm very careful,'' she said. ''I don't want to start trouble.'',At least one client and another psychic says Ms. Vernon's readings are on target, although, she allows, ''I'm right about 80 percent of the time.'',People often go to her for healing although ''I don't presume to be a medical doctor or God,'' she said. ''Not formally trained as a healer, I do my own techniques, and it works for me.'' However, she readily admits her limitations. In the case of her own mother, who died of leukemia, ''I'd relieve her pain, kept her alive much longer, but I couldn't save her life,'' she said.,Her ability may be based on simply being more perceptive and receptive than the average person. ''I believe most people are psychic,'' she said. ''Everyone can learn to play the piano, but not everyone's talented.'',JOHN FOORD,An Age-Old Path To New Realities,Gertrude Stein asked on her deathbed, ''What is the answer?'' Alice B. Toklas, her lover and lifelong companion, remained silent. Stein then asked, ''In that case, what is the question?'' The question, it seems, is everything, in the view of John Foord: ''You adjust reality by defining it.'',For Mr. Foord, who lives in Chatham, such a shamanic philosophy is a way of learning to perceive life by using not only the conscious but also the subconscious, or intuitive, part of oneself that one has, through social conditioning, learned to distrust. ''I don't like to use the word unconscious because we're conscious but we don't use part of it,'' he said. ''We've lost a lot of our skills through education.'',Mr. Foord, a mechanical engineer, worked for Exxon until he retired more than a decade ago. His wife, Janet, was head of the science department at Kent Place School for Girls in Summit for 20 years. He came to shamanistic journeying through his studies with Dr. Michael Harner, a world-renowned anthropologist who is the director of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies in Mill Valley, Calif. And Mr. Foord has been a guest lecturer at Drew University in Madison, the City College of New York and New York University.,''All it takes is to realize that there's more than one reality in the world,'' Mr. Foord said. To help his clients see other realities, he teaches them how to enter a trance state, often encouraged by the rhythmic beating of a drum. And while the idea may be frightening, he is quick to explain: ''A trance state means not directly connecting with ordinary reality. When we watch TV, we're in a trance. Sixty percent of waking life is in a trance. One hundred percent of non-waking life'' -- that is, sleep -- ''is in a trance.'',''People don't use their total capabilities in problem-solving,'' Mr. Foord said. Once in the trance, the client asks a question. ''In shamanic journeying, the question is always a what, not a why,'' he said. ''The client speaks into a tape recorder It's important to record the sessions. People tend to forget what they hear if it doesn't fit in with their usual thoughts.'',He also believes the answer is within. ''You are the supreme expert on yourself,'' he said. ''We tend to believe others more than ourselves.'',The objective in going on a shamanistic journey is to open oneself up to unusual or non-linear thought. ''It's important that people realize that they're not just linear thinking machines,'' Mr. Foord said. ''A computer is that. We don't invent anything with school knowledge. You have to go beyond what you're taught. Everyone has second sight.'' But, he added: ''People often tend to ignore or dismiss their intuitions, thinking, 'If I didn't learn it in school, it isn't valid.' '',In addition to teaching shamanistic journeying, Mr. Foord uses massage as a healing technique and also practices shamanistic healing, which has been used worldwide in one form or another for more than 20,000 years. He addresses illnesses by asking, ''What causes the interruption of the normal rejection of toxicities?'' Using his hands to hover over the body, he said, he believes he can feel ''a viscosity that has the consistency of honey,'' and within that he sometimes finds ''something like a straw, a wire or rock.'' Using the shamanic technique of extraction, he then asks the object, or toxicity, to come out. It may sound bizarre, but he says it often works and counts a physician and an attorney among his successes as clients.,''Getting in touch with one's own spirit is crucial,'' Mr. Foord said, ''because everything is imbued with spirit. Therefore everything and everyone is connected. My long-term goal would be to shamanize the world because if everyone could connect, the world would be a lovely place.'',NANCY ORLEN WEBER,A Gift That Comes With Some Burdens,''When someone asks me, 'What do you do?' my answer is, 'I do life.' '',Nancy Orlen Weber worked for many years as a registered nurse. Now, she is a healer of another sort. But she doesn't ask her clients about their symptoms.,''I do not diagnose; I do not treat,'' she said. ''I look and scan the energy field.'' That tells her ''all I need to know to help people heal.'' It may sound nutty, but she welcomes skepticism. She was once skeptical of her own abilities and wondered if she were not suffering a form of mental illness. But ''experience proved me both sane and effective,'' she said.,''My job is talking therapeutically,'' said Ms. Weber, who teaches body-mind awareness and visualization as a stress-management technique. She does not use tarot cards or palmistry because ''the mind is the best tool,'' she said. ''You don't really need anything to be part of the universe.'',Ms. Weber, who lives in Denville, says she has always been very perceptive -- and even remembers her own birth. When, as a young child, she described it, her mother stared at her in disbelief and said, ''How did you know that?'' Good question. ''I always thought that other people were kind of blind,'' she said. ''That's what made me see that it's a gift.'',But there were also problems. She predicted so many deaths she ended up feeling responsible when the predictions came true and other children began calling her a witch. Now, although she focuses on the beautiful, she also sees the ugly.,Since 1980, she has worked with law-enforcement agencies, including the Morris County Sheriff's Department, as a consultant on cases involving missing children, murder and rape. She has earned a commendation from the department as well as a badge. ''Really good detecting is intuitive,'' she said. ''It takes all the data and processes it below the conscious level.'' While this kind of work, for which she receives no financial compensation, is extremely stressful, it is also ''most satisfying,'' she said.,In addition to being a nurse and teaching holistic healing techniques at the County College of Morris, Ms. Weber is an interfaith minister has been trained in psychotherapy. She and her husband, Dick, an electrical engineer and computer expert, are the founders of Holistic Alliance International.,Her clients run the gamut: young and old, men and women, professionals and blue-collar workers, artists and those who lead more prosaic lives. She works with them on relationships and health issues like addressing chronic pain, nutrition and weight management, abuse and panic attacks. She also works with people in rehabilitation institutes.But her intent is not to provide continuing therapy; it's to teach people, in just a couple of sessions, to develop their own ways to maintain and improve their health.,Ms. Weber uses her psychic awareness to help find lost pets and works with S.P.C.A. of Morris County on animal cruelty cases. She has worked with the equine industry to improve the health and performance of horses.,A woman of seemingly boundless energy, she is the author of a self-published memoir, ''Psychic Detective,'' which chronicles her work in law enforcement. She has also written and produced a series of audiotapes, ''Inner Journeys.'' And as a Universalist minister in the Life Spirit Congregational Church, she loves to conduct weddings.,In addition to all her other activities, she has a cable television show, ''Body, Mind and Spirit,'' which appears Fridays at 5 P.M. on Cablevision channel 3 in North Jersey. And she is reinstating her weekly workshops in Denville.,''Being of benefit, helping strengthen other lives is extremely rewarding,'' she said. ''I feel grateful for being able to be of service.'',JEANETTE MONICO,Looking to the Stars For Energy and Healing,Jeanette Monico of Rockaway didn't grow up knowing psychics or believing in the paranormal. A Roman Catholic from Brooklyn. she married young, had children and eventually moved to Staten Island. ''I outgrew my first marriage and sought more meaning in life,'' she said. She found it in astrology -- not uncommon in the 1970's, when the most common pick-up line was ''What's your sign?'' (Hers is Sagittarius.),Nowadays, an astrological chart can be done in minutes with a computer. Back then, it was an intensive, time-consuming process that required logorhythmic calculations. Although Ms. Monico found these computations difficult, she persevered. Many other students' interest in astrology eventually waned, but hers grew.,''I became a person who had more depth, more insight,'' she said. ''It became my tool. I used it to look deeper into people; it helped me understand people better.'' She found herself seeking more and more knowledge and discovered what was then the American School of Astrology in West Orange, run by Sylvia Sherman, who became a close friend.,''Astrology was the path that led me to different directions,'' she said. In addition to being an astrologer and psychic, Ms. Monico is both a licensed practitioner of Reiki massage therapy and a cosmetician, as well as an ordained minister in the Universal Life Church, as many psychics are.,She considers herself a healer, not only through Reiki but also in her work as a cosmetician at Just for You Women's Center in East Hanover. It provides beauty and health services for women, including some undergoing treatment for cancer. Using wigs and cosmetics, she helps these women feel more attractive, and while this is not a cure, it often helps them heal.,Ms. Monico says she has experienced visions, sees auras and continues to practice as a psychic. ''God is an energy,'' she said. ''I call it God because that's what I've been taught, but it's faith, spirit and energy. Faith, love and trust equal a holy trinity.'',Most of her clients are people in transition who want advice. ''They're usually in their 20's,'' she said, ''or in midlife when they're feeling, 'Let's get ready to rumble again.' '' Although ''I believe I can influence what I see,'' she said, ''I never want to see bad things.'' But she acknowledged: ''I don't mind if I see a bad time coming. I don't feel you can stop anything.'',A Dark Cloud Over Your Head? Not Likely,THE problem with psychics is problems.,''Problems are what usually drive people to seek the help of psychics, and there are quite a few disreputable people who make it their business to take advantage of this situation,'' said MaryAnne Alvaro of Global Psychics in Toronto. ''They prey on the troubled, the weak and the gullible.'',Some astrologers have undergone intensive training, passed an exam and been certified, but no one needs a degree, training or license to hang a shingle. ''Never go to someone off the street,'' said Jeannette Monico, a licensed practitioner of Reiki massage therapy and a cosmetician, as well as an ordained minister in the Universal Life Church. ''You feel desperate, and they know it.'',Rose Vernon warned against patronizing fortunetellers who frighten clients with negative predictions. ''They say, 'I see a dark cloud over your head' and extract a lot of money to make it disappear,'' she said. ''No one has a dark cloud over their head. The only thing they've made disappear is your money. And it's disappeared into their pockets.'' She also warned against ''anyone who tries to sell you candles or other objects to strengthen or heal your aura.'',Several of the psychics interviewed related the story of a woman who was told by a self-described healer that it would cost $20,000 to be rid of the cause of her troubles. ''The healer advised her to bring that amount in cash, in a brown paper bag, that they would then burn as part of a ceremony of exorcism,'' Ms. Alvaro said.When the patron balked, ''her healer countered with 'Your problems won't go away unless you prove that you love God more than money.' Although the troubled woman had been taught money is the root of all evil, she was wise enough to realize that burning her life savings would only add to her woes.'',How do you find a reputable psychic or spiritual healer? ''The best advertisement is the recommendation of a satisfied customer,'' Ms. Vernon said.,Nancy Orlen Weber advised, ''Ask a health food store proprietor or a therapist. Numerous publications such as New Jersey Naturally and Shamanism may be of help.'',If you choose to go to an astrologer, seek someone certified by one of the numerous astrology associations that require course work and tests for certification. The American Federation of Astrologers, established in 1937 and based in Tempe, Ariz., requires an eight-hour exam to prove competency in the mathematics of erecting and interpreting astrological charts. Members also agree to abide by a code of ethics. Files must be kept confidential, and the astrologer should be available for follow-up. ''Ask if the astrologer is certified and how long he's been in practice,'' said Judi Zeisler, a California astrologer who is a spokeswoman for the federation. ''Run from anyone who uses only a first name or mentions death.'',All the psychics interviewed warned against accepting any reading as 100 percent accurate.,''If you tell them one or two things that are accurate, they tend to believe it all without scrutinizing,'' Ms. Munzer said.,In New Jersey, the price of readings may begin at $10 to $15 for a short reading by a street psychic and go beyond $150 for a reading or an astrological chart. Ms. Vernon charges $35 for a half-hour reading.,''Beware anyone who tries to hit you up for cash; sell you candles or crystals; tells you someone else is responsible for your bad luck; warns you not to tell anyone about the reading, or tries to interest you in additional readings,'' Ms. Alvaro said. ''No one needs more than one reading a year, although some people find the process so therapeutic that they become addicts.'',Is it necessary to reveal anything to a psychic? ''There is an inherent contract,'' Ms. Weber said. ''Both parties are obliged to give and receive information with as much authenticity and compassion as possible.'' Most, however, said they preferred clients not to offer personal information. Although they are glad to answer questions, psychics prefer to do the talking.",BARBARA WIND,"FEB. 28, 1999","Seeing Things; Reading Palms, Auras and Computer Printouts to Write Psychic Roadmaps",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/seeing-things-reading-palms-auras-computer-printouts-write-psychic-roadmaps.html
"In DISTRACTION (Spectra/Bantam, $23.95) the estimable Bruce Sterling demonstrates why science fiction is such a difficult genre to get right. One of the inventors of cyberpunk, the stylistic and conceptual revolution that helped revitalize science fiction in the 1980's, Sterling has gone on to imagine densely layered futures inhabited by quirkily obsessive characters in novels like ''Islands in the Net,'' ''Heavy Weather'' and ''Holy Fire.'' The mid-21st-century America that forms the backdrop for ''Distraction'' is as elaborately detailed as any near-future milieu in recent science fiction. Yet the very detail that Sterling has provided undercuts the story he wants to tell and reduces the players in the drama to bloodless puppets of the authorial imagination.,Oscar Valparaiso, a brilliant political operative, is ''not exactly human,'' having been birthed in a vat by a black market ''embryo mill'' that fooled around with his DNA to enhance his powers of survival. The book opens at a moment of triumph: Oscar has masterminded the election to the Senate of an idiosyncratic architect named Alcott Bambakias.,Sterling's vision of the United States in the year 2044 is challenging, to say the least. Global warming has raised sea levels worldwide, flooding low-lying coastal areas. The Chinese have bankrupted America by making ''all English-language intellectual property freely available on their satellite networks''; the Air Force, starved for funds, is shaking down motorists at highway blockades. Birth rates are plunging; death rates are soaring. There are 16 major political parties; ''Emergency Congressional committees'' and strong local politicians have seized great chunks of power from the Federal Government.,The plot concerns Oscar's efforts to bring some kind of order to the ''biggest bio-research center in the world,'' a famously out-of-control facility known as the Buna National Collaboratory. But so unlikely is the next-century scenario concocted by Sterling that I found myself unable to take the actions of his characters seriously, even as satire. Ideas as counterintuitive as the bankrupting of the United States by the overnight obliteration of copyright and trademark laws cannot function as mere background for other events; they call for front-and-center treatment on their own.,Sterling seems aware that readers may balk at his wilder suppositions; he pre-emptively tags his imagined America as ''weird,'' ''mad,'' ''crazy.'' Oscar's behavior, which follows no rules I could divine, raises similar objections, which are hardly laid to rest by having a colleague characterize him as ''just a very, very weird guy.'',Many of Sterling's speculations, taken separately, are entertaining if only because of their thought-provoking absurdity. But strung together without regard for historical or narrative logic, they overwhelm the reader, ultimately failing to engage either the mind or the emotions.                     --------------------,William Shatner, who once fought for universal decency as Capt. James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise, has lent his talents (or at least his name) to several series of science fiction books for young people. STEP INTO CHAOS (Harper Prism, $23) is the third novel in his ''Quest for Tomorrow'' series. I confess that I have not read the first two volumes, but Shatner has thoughtfully provided a four-and-a-half-page synopsis that is no more confusing than the novel itself. Suffice it to say that the 17-year-old Jim Endicott holds the key to the fate of the human species, not to mention at least two rival galactic empires. Getting him to shoulder his responsibilities is not easy, however, because he has been drinking too much ever since he accidentally killed the man he believed to be his father.,We know that he is suffering because when his mother bursts into tears, ''guilt bloomed as a ball of nausea in his stomach.'' Saving the universe leaves precious little time for therapy, even with a shrink savvy enough to understand that Jim's experiences have left him with a severe case of ''adolescent adjustment disorder.'' Fortunately, Jim pulls himself together in time to confront some really scary stuff, like the telepathic machinations of the disembodied intelligence known as Outsider: ''The darkness seemed to breathe inside his skull. Then it subsided, leaving behind the emotional equivalent of a bathtub ring, a feeling of scum stuck to the sides of his psyche.'',What makes science fiction such a remarkable genre is that in fewer than 240 pages an emotionally and stylistically challenged protagonist like Jim can end up chatting with God, resuscitating the man he called Dad and reinventing the universe. Through it all, Jim remains the same decent teen-ager he has always been. When he learns in the new and improved universe that he has killed someone -- not Dad this time but Dad's would-be assassin -- the nausea of guilt blooms on cue in his gut: ''It felt . . . it felt awful.''                     --------------------,In contrast, all the hilarity in GODSHOME (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95), by Robert Sheckley, is intentional. Sheckley has long been considered one of the genre's leading humorists -- a somewhat hollow distinction since, with the exception of Douglas Adams's ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' series, science fiction has rarely enjoyed laughing at itself. And in fact ''Godshome'' is better described as a whimsical fantasy with scientific trappings.,When Arthur Fenn, an unemployed ''Ph.D. in comparative mythology,'' receives an ancient Hebrew tome, he is slow to realize that the spells scratched on its pages give him access to the gods of earlier civilizations. These deities, who lost their jobs when their last worshipers died, live in a cosmic old-age facility called Godshome. Despite Fenn's entreaties, most prefer to remain in comfortable retirement rather than help him out of the financial jam he has stumbled into. The only gods who answer his call turn out to be mischief makers. Getting rid of them requires, in the end, the creation of a new universe.,Sheckley has some fun with the grumpy old divinities, who refuse to return to the ''god eat god'' rivalries on Earth, and with the false religion started by the real gods who accept Arthur's invitation. But in places the whimsy gets as thick as week-old goulash. To enter fully into the spirit of ''Godshome,'' you have to be able to enjoy the banter of a narcissistic ''singularity'' at the center of a black hole, whose appearance varies from ''a ball of wiry black hair out of which two bright eyes peeked'' to a ''green 1938 Oldsmobile,'' and who asks Arthur during an interview, ''So how did you like my event horizon?'' Other readers may second the opinion of a minor deity named Scabber who reveals that ''if there's one thing a god finds boring it's talking to a human in a dream.''",GERALD JONAS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Science Fiction,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/science-fiction.html
"Since word got out nearly a month ago that a woman named Joan Byron-Marasek was keeping 17 tigers in the middle of Jackson Township, other residents around the state might not be blamed for wondering whether there were rhinoceroses down the road or perhaps giraffes in the next town.,Not likely, said Paulette Nelson, a senior biologist with the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. Ms. Byron-Marasek's Tigers Only Preserve is an extreme rarity in New Jersey, a state that animal specialists and conservationists say is one of the strictest when it comes to letting people keep unusual animals.,While New Jersey issued about 10,000 permits last year to owners of such small exotic pets as snakes, ferrets, Siberian hamsters and various species of finches and cockatoos, it was far stingier with permits for larger beasts, like Ms. Byron-Marasek's tigers. Only 246 such permits were issued last year, Ms. Nelson said. Wildlife officials want strict controls on importing and exhibiting exotic creatures, she said, to discourage trade that could further diminish their numbers in the wild, as well as to limit the dangers that imported animals might pose to local species.,Still, there are some notables among those who have joined the Tiger Lady of Jackson Township on the state permit list. There is Joseph D'Angeli, the Bat Man of Little Ferry, with his basement compound containing a dozen fruit bats from Egypt and Indonesia, with wingspans of up to five feet. And there is Joseph Bush, the Monkey Man of Cherry Hill, with his three capuchin monkeys from South America, who watch television from their cages in his home when they aren't on the road with him playing bar mitzvahs, conventions or Atlantic City casinos.,Mr. Bush calls himself the state's only organ grinder licensed to exhibit monkeys. He says that dealing with exotic animals is not for everyone, and he himself has never kept more than three of the monkeys at once.,''I used to be a musician, and then 25 years ago, when I was in between bands, I bought this monkey and became a solo act,'' said Mr. Bush in a practiced rapid-fire delivery that consciously plays for the rim shot. ''Now I make more money and I can depend on them, because I have the key to the cage.'',His white-faced capuchin monkeys live in a cage in one of the bedrooms of his Cherry Hill home and he has hired them out for magazine advertisements, television commercials, birthday parties, ''meet and greets'' at corporate functions as well the Showboat casino in Atlantic City, where they are among the roving attractions.,He is one of 10 people in the state licensed to keep monkeys, he said, and occasionally he gets a surprise visit from a curious child who has moved into the neighborhood and has heard about the guy with the monkeys. But he said that generally he and other handlers of exotic capuchins, macaques and spider monkeys keep a low profile for fear of attracting the attention of animal rights activists.,''People are so wacked out that they don't think any animal ought to be in captivity,'' he said.,For Mr. D'Angeli, bats are not so much his pets as his passion. All his neighbors know about the unusual creatures in his basement, as do hordes of schoolchildren to whom he gives lectures, as well as audiences at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City. He and his bats have also appeared on television, on David Letterman's talk show and ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'',''They call me the real Batman,'' he said of the children in many of his audiences. ''But then some of the kids get upset when I don't have a cape on.'',A member of the American Zoological Society and a consultant on bats to zoos and nature centers, Mr. D'Angeli became intrigued with the creatures because of the large colony of indigenous brown bats that live in the nearby Hackensack Meadowlands. He read all that he could on the subject and seven years ago he obtained his first large bat, an Indian flying fox from Indonesia.,''Brown bats are fine, but they are too small to be great educational props,'' Mr. D'Angeli said, noting that this native species rarely measures more than 10 inches with wings spread wide. ''My large ones have cute faces and can be seen well when I do my lectures.'',The owner of an exotic pet store in Fort Lee, Mr. D'Angeli does not think private individuals should keep bats like his as pets, and he was instrumental in having bats removed from the Federal and state listings of permitted pets. Bats like his, he said, should be kept only for educational and research purposes and in setups like his, which have to be inspected annually and licensed by both Federal and state agencies.,In stark contrast to the voluble Mr. Bush and Mr. D'Angeli, Ms. Byron-Marasek has remained silent and secluded at the center of the storm raging over her 12-acre tiger preserve. A key question is whether a 431-pound tiger that was killed after it was found wandering in the area was one of hers. She has denied it, but state officials have ordered forensic tests on the dead animal to find out.,Under her state permit, Ms. Byron-Marasek is allowed to keep the animals for theatrical and educational purposes, but state wildlife inspectors have turned up little evidence that they are being used for either.,Last week, angry officials of Jackson Township ratcheted up their efforts to close the compound, citing a recent letter from a state consultant who deemed the compound unsafe and questioned Ms. Byron-Marasek's competence to care for the animals. The Mayor of Jackson Township, William J. Allmann, said the municipality would try in court on Tuesday to force the state to close it immediately as unsafe.,Asked whether any of the controversy surrounding Ms. Byron-Marasek's tiger preserve had affected him, Mr. D'Angeli said that he had detected wariness among state regulators to his recent request for permits for additional animals to enliven his lectures on rain forests.,''I wanted to add a sloth and a monkey, but we were told that we couldn't because the state thought that we didn't have the proper experience,'' he said. ''The people in charge of the permits have given me and other people doing legitimate research a hard time with permits because of the incident with the tigers.''",RONALD SMOTHERS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Scared of Wild Neighbors?,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/scared-of-wild-neighbors.html
"THROUGH the biggest bull market in history, Gerald D. Putnam struggled as a stockbroker. Starting in 1981, he bounced around 7 firms in 12 years.,Then the Internet changed his fortune. Last month, Goldman, Sachs and E*Trade came calling, each putting up $25 million for a 24.5 percent stake in his young stock trading network called Archipelago. The deal also values Mr. Putnam's quarter of Archipelago Holdings at roughly $25 million.,Call it vision. Mr. Putnam, now 40, says he determined two years ago that the future of investing was nothing but Net. With partners from a Chicago software firm called Townsend Analytics, he created Archipelago, an electronic network designed to provide investors in Nasdaq shares with an alternative, lower-cost market in which they could meet and trade stocks.,But even as he summons the respect and the resources that so long eluded him, Mr. Putnam appears to have drifted into murky waters. The brokerage firm he owns, Terra Nova Trading, which directs trades to Archipelago,  has skirted some industry regulations and engaged in questionable practices.,Two of its 12 branch offices make  payments to Internet chat rooms that send paying customers to them, an arrangement that the firm calls advertising but that may run afoul of Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These two branches also arrange loans for customers who need to raise money to satisfy margin requirements -- the rules limiting how much borrowed money a stock purchaser can use in a transaction. Excessive borrowing puts an investor at risk when stocks fall; such leverage is a growing concern among state securities regulators. In addition, a man who Mr. Putnam said ''runs the office'' at one Terra Nova branch is not registered with securities regulators, a requirement for someone who solicits clients and deals heavily with customers. There are also questions about Mr. Putnam's trading practices at Terra Nova's headquarters in Chicago.,Mr. Putnam called the suggestions of impropriety nonsense. ''I've been in business 17 years, and there's not a mark on my record,'' he said. ''It's not my idea of starting a crime spree here. I've not risked anything before, and I don't have to. I've got a great business.'',While the brokerage firm is separate from the Archipelago network, there are rumblings of dissatisfaction with Archipelago as well. Some knowledgeable, frequent traders are complaining that they are not getting the best possible prices by using the network. And one professional trading firm says it has chosen not to offer Archipelago to its clients.,The reports conflict with Archipelago's promise of a low-cost, instant service for investors, while the Terra Nova practices are a reminder of how treacherous the waters can be for on-line traders and companies eager to stake Internet claims.,MR. PUTNAM was certainly prescient when he latched onto Internet trading. Dirt-cheap commissions at on-line brokerage firms, and sophisticated software systems that speed customers' orders to the markets, have combined to make stock trading the best business on the Internet. Electronic trading is now used for one in four stock transactions made by individual investors. Much of this trading is executed on electronic communication networks like Archipelago.,There are eight such networks, known as E.C.N.'s; seven of them were created within the last three years. Their goal is to cut out the intermediaries between buyers and sellers in stock transactions. Nasdaq stocks are their primary business. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq market does not have a central trading floor; this allows many dealers to ''make markets,'' facilitating investors' trades in its stocks, including today's sizzling technology offerings like Excite, Ebay, Amazon.com and Yahoo.,The portion of Nasdaq stock trading executed by electronic communications networks is estimated at more than 20 percent. Trading volume now exceeds that of the American Stock Exchange and all the nation's regional stock exchanges combined.,Archipelago, or Arca, as it is sometimes called, is by no means the biggest. That prize goes to Instinet, a network begun in 1969 to allow mutual funds and other institutional investors to post orders anonymously at prices inside the wide spreads -- the difference between the ''bid'' prices offered by buyers and the ''asked'' prices that sellers are willing to accept -- on Nasdaq stocks. Instinet, a subsidiary of Reuters, now trades in more than 40 stock markets around the world, including the New York Stock Exchange, which is looking for a way to set up its own network to trade Nasdaq stocks.,Most of the newer E.C.N.'s are, like Instinet, for institutional customers only. But Archipelago and The Island ECN, owned by Datek Holdings, an on-line brokerage firm based in Iselin, N.J., accept trades from  smaller investors.,These networks grew out of changes in the Nasdaq market made after an S.E.C. investigation in the mid-1990's. The most significant new rule requires Nasdaq trading firms, known as market makers, to provide posting on their trading systems for customer orders that fall between the bid and asked prices.,In its 1996 report, the S.E.C. found that investor orders between the bid and the ask were rarely, if ever, displayed. As a result, investors had a tough time meeting one another without the interference of a market maker and wound up paying excessively to trade Nasdaq stocks. Meanwhile, investors in stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange were meeting other investors 90 percent of the time without the intervention of traders.,Enter the E.C.N.'s, which allow individual investors to post their prices electronically and meet other investors willing to take the opposite sides of their trades. Among the networks serving small customers, Island has by far the biggest volume: some 2.5 billion shares were traded there last year; Archipelago reported 650 million shares traded. Though there are differences in the ways E.C.N.'s tally volume, Archipelago is clearly much smaller. But it is expected to grow smartly in the coming months, with the firepower of Goldman, Sachs and E*Trade. At the time of the deal, Goldman, Sachs said investing in Archipelago was part of meeting its commitment to a broad array of trade execution systems for its customers, while E*Trade said it would aggressively market the E.C.N. to its customers.,Archipelago was a natural offshoot of Mr. Putnam's brokerage firm. He founded Terra Nova in 1994 as a day-trading firm that used Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System, or SOES, to capitalize on small discrepancies between market makers' bid prices and asked prices in various stocks. Then it grew into a cyberbroker, handling on-line trades for individual investors through branch offices in White Plains and in El Segundo and San Jose, Calif., among others. Some of these offices also house what Mr. Putnam calls day-trading salons, rooms that seat as many as 40 people who bring in their own capital and trade furiously on line each day.,With a stream of orders from these brokerage operations, Mr. Putnam seized on the Nasdaq changes to create an electronic network for executing trades. ''Our business plan was to provide immediate direct access to the marketplace,'' he said.,With the brokerage firm and the electronic network, Mr. Putnam and his partners do well. When two customers' orders are matched, Archipelago earns a commission of one-half cent to 2.5 cents a share. If it matches 75 million shares a month, as it did in January, those commissions run somewhere between $375,000 and $1.8 million a month.,Even bigger money comes from the charges levied on Internet customers and day traders. Terra Nova receives about $7 a trade. Mr. Putnam says it has 6,000 clients, who average 70 trades each a month; that pace would produce almost $3 million a month in revenues.,The day after Archipelago's deal with Goldman, Sachs and E*Trade was announced, Mr. Putnam resigned as president of Terra Nova Trading to focus full time on Archipelago. But he still owns Terra Nova.,He lives in the affluent Chicago suburb of Kenilworth and has a vacation house in Wisconsin. Not bad for someone who describes his career in the securities industry as ''rocky'' and says he was asked to leave his brokerage job at Prudential Securities in 1993.,Terra Nova's biggest branch office is MB Trading in El Segundo. Ross Ditlove runs the office, according to Mr. Putnam, and he answers customers' questions about MB Trading on the Internet. He also promotes the company to potential clients. He is not, however, registered with securities regulators, a requirement for any individual who deals closely with brokerage customers.,''We don't solicit customers,'' Mr. Putnam said when asked about the rule. ''There's no rule you have to be registered,'' he said, if you're not soliciting customers.,Rules about who must be registered in the securities industry leave some room for interpretation. The National Association of Securities Dealers is fairly explicit. It says people soliciting on behalf of member firms must be registered. Employees are exempt if they are strictly clerical employees, if they are inviting customers to firm-sponsored seminars, if they are asking customers whether they want to discuss investments with a registered person, or if they are offering to send sales literature.,INVESTORS who use Internet sites for advice may be surprised to discover who gets a portion of their trades. MB Trading and another Terra Nova branch office, the Executioner in White Plains, have made financial payments to two Internet sites devoted to stock investing, without disclosure, according to a person close to Terra Nova who spoke on condition of anonymity. The sites are Trading-places.net, which has a link with MB Trading, and Pristine.com, which is linked to the Executioner.,In exchange for referring customers to MB Trading, the Internet site receives $1 to $2 a trade from the branch office, the person close to Terra Nova said, adding that the Executioner makes similar payments.,Trading-places.net states in a disclaimer: ''We do not recommend any particular broker(s)'' or ''brokerage firm.'' But in a section of its site about software providers, a page pops up with this headline in bold type: ''Trading Places Recommends MB Trading.'' The recommendation is technically for MB Trading's software.,Pristine.com is more subtle. In a question and answer section, Pristine ''strongly suggests'' that active traders start at the Executioner. It recommends the Terra Nova branch office several times. Only one other firm is mentioned.,Neither Trading-places.net nor Pristine.com is registered with securities regulators. While it does not comment on specific cases, the S.E.C. has stated in the past that registration would be required of any person receiving a percentage of commissions or other transaction-based compensation.,Mr. Putnam said any fees are part of an advertising arrangement. ''Per-trade payments are against policy here,'' he said. He went on to describe the payments as advertising fees for putting a branch office's banner on the Internet site. But advertising fees are typically flat rates, not variable payments based on trading volume.,Chris Rea, who is the owner of Trading-places.net, denied that he received payments for customers sent to MB Trading. Executives at Pristine did not return a telephone call.,Some Terra Nova branches also arrange loans for their customers to help them meet margin calls. These calls are triggered when a customer has borrowed money to buy a stock and the shares drop substantially, requiring the customer to deposit more money to make up for the depleted value of the stock held in the account. To customers who are overextended during the course of the trading day, the Executioner offers  access to what is called an overnight bank, according to a customer who expressed surprise at the practice.  The firm, which is not a chartered bank, charges $100 daily to arrange the loans, which help customers leverage their accounts. MB Trading provides a similar service.,''I don't know what an overnight bank is,'' Mr. Putnam said when asked about the practice. ''Now I know customers lend one another money. If a customer wants to loan money to another, we require signatures and customer authorization. There is no facility here for lending customers money that we orchestrate.'' Mr. Putnam likened the situation to a customer borrowing money from a relative: ''There's nothing wrong with that.'',BUT excessive borrowing by investors, especially at day-trading firms, is a concern among securities regulators, who worry about how much money overextended investors stand to lose if their stocks plunge.,Frank Zarb, chairman of the N.A.S.D., expressed concern early this month that some firms were ''extending credit inappropriately,'' by pooling customers' capital. ''It is not within the spirit of what should be our mutual goal of protecting investors,'' Mr. Zarb said.,Another troubling issue involves Mr. Putnam's own trading practices at Terra Nova's headquarters in Chicago. The firm uses a system called Retail Auto Execution System, meant for retail customers only, to capitalize on small discrepancies in prices of equity options from exchange to exchange. The system was intended to assure that small trades would be executed promptly at fair prices. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, which created R.A.E.S., and the Pacific Stock Exchange recently instituted measures intended to prevent the price discrepancies.,An options account at Terra Nova belonging to Mr. Putnam's wife, Sharon, has generated enormous profits using the retail execution system. Mr. Putnam said the trading was not a problem because it was done for a customer, his wife. ''Only if you trade a firm's proprietary capital, you're not supposed to use R.A.E.S,'' he said.,But a spokeswoman at the Chicago options exchange said that while Mr. Putnam may be technically correct, he is ''violating the spirit of the rule,'' which forbids any broker-dealer from using the retail execution system for the benefit of its accounts.,Mr. Putnam's crowning achievement remains Archipelago. It was designed to have certain advantages over Island, the bigger but older system. Instead of simply letting investors post their prices on the network in the hope that another investor will come along who is interested in buying or selling at the same price, Mr. Putnam's system allows an order to leave the Archipelago network once it has been determined that nobody is willing to take the other side of the trade. ''We built Arca with a best-execution model in mind,'' Mr. Putnam said. ''We'll go out and get your order filled.'',But the system doesn't always work that way. According to several veteran traders who were doing business with Terra Nova and had their trades routed to Arca, market orders -- an eternity, in volatile Nasdaq stocks. The veteran traders say they were then forced to take inferior prices on their trades as the market moved away from the prices they had originally sought.,Part of the problem with Arca is that it does not have the volume of orders that a larger network like Island does. In January, Arca matched 75.6 million shares to Island's 864 million. So the chances of meeting an investor interested in buying the stock you are selling, or the reverse, is much greater on Island than it is on Arca.,Mr. Putnam said: ''We weren't focused like other E.C.N.'s on generating lots of orders on the system. We were concerned with execution.'' Of course, orders could flood the system if E*Trade or Goldman, Sachs begin funneling customers' orders to Arca. But for now, trading on Arca amounts to choosing a small, sparsely populated trading room instead of a big, crowded one.,Garth F. Lansaw, a financial planner in Pennsylvania, says using Arca impaired his investing results. Until last month, he had executed his personal trades through Terra Nova and Archipelago. But he has quit doing business with the firm.,Over six months, Mr. Lansaw said, many of his trades were not executed when they were sent to Archipelago, even though they were placed at the prevailing market price. Like many active investors, Mr. Lansaw has an advanced computerized system, which allowed him to see the different prices offered on stocks by trading firms like Merrill Lynch or Knight Securities.,He cites several problems that came up when he was trying to sell 2,000 shares of Fore Systems last fall at the current asked price. ''I'd see 15,000 or 20,000 shares go by without getting hit,'' he said. ''In some cases I was the only one sitting there'' --  even though he had the best price posted on the screen. After 30 seconds or a minute went by, the price would change, he said. So to sell the stock, he had to lower his price.,Even though Mr. Putnam assures customers that their orders will be instantly routed elsewhere if they are not filled within the Archipelago system, Mr. Lansaw says this did not happen. Other investors sounding off on the Silicon Investor's site on the Internet tell similar tales.,MR. PUTNAM concedes that much of his time is spent educating customers about how Archipelago works. ''A lot of time these people complain they're trying to buy some Yahoo at the current offer and the thing's on fire,'' he said. ''And we're sending it to a market maker, and it doesn't get done. That's because somebody else beat them to the punch.'',Steven Goldman, a principal at Yamner & Company, a brokerage in Fairlawn, N.J., executes trades for his firm's institutional and wealthy individual customers. To make sure these clients get the best prices for their trades, Yamner has links to 16 trading systems -- but not Archipelago. ''I found their pricing structure was prohibitive,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''I didn't like the technology, as to how it would link in.'',Ever the entrepreneur, Mr. Putnam is not standing still. ''We're going to continue to expand our business,'' he said. ''I want to start offering products and services to the more traditional investors. There's still room in that on-line space for more competitors.''",GRETCHEN MORGENSON,"FEB. 28, 1999","Sailing Into Murky Waters; A Trading Network Woos Wall Street, As Questions Arise About a Sister Firm",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/sailing-into-murky-waters-trading-network-woos-wall-street-questions-arise-about.html
"A  NEW HAVEN welfare recipient trained for a job at Shaw's supermarket and was hired for 20 hours a week. When the woman received a notice to attend an  orientation and testing session at the State Labor Department, the woman was insulted, said Gracie Brown, a director of the Welfare Justice Project in New Haven. Ms. Brown said the woman wondered why she had to go through the process again since she had completed the training and had a job.,Ms. Brown also said the woman was given a simple aptitude test and reported being treated as if she were stupid.,The woman's situation and reaction highlights some of the confusion and problems the welfare reform program is generating in Connecticut. The program limits recipients, in most cases, to 21 months of welfare. About 97 percent of the state's family welfare caseload is comprised of mothers and their children.,Interviews with state officials, advocates for women and poor people, as well as with job training coordinators show a complicated, sometimes confusing, system with few opportunities for real job training and frequent lack of compliance with program requirements. The latter is in spite of penalties that diminish benefits with successive infractions. (To counter fraud, the state requires ''digital imaging,'' fingerprinting the two index fingers of recipients.),Advocates for poor people have expressed concern that many recipients have fallen through the cracks, have not received services they are entitled to, and are being harshly penalized. Legal aid lawyers cited cases, including ones involving disabled people and parents of seriously ill children who lost benefits, and a family  including two disabled children cut off from welfare for five months before being reinstated.,The Rev. Bonita Grubbs, executive director of Christian Community Action in New Haven, is upset that women are being told to abandon high school equivalency classes for short-term, job-search sessions.,Some of the problems stem from the vastly different philosophies of the past and current welfare programs. Connecticut long had an entitlement system that took care of families indefinitely. Welfare recipients have had to adjust to a temporary assistance program that forces them to get jobs, even if they are part-time and don't pay enough to remove the families from welfare rolls or other government programs. In addition, the system was changed eight months after the first recipients were affected by reform. That resulted in all recipients being called back for in-person interviews with two state agencies and job counselors, a process that is continuing. ''These poor clients have had the program change on them so many times,'' admitted Nancy Wiggett, director of the Welfare to Work program in the State Department of Labor. But, she said, the changes necessitate individual interviews so the clients understand the changes.,Ms. Wiggett said some people disagree with the ''work first'' emphasis of the current program and its goal of ''getting people into labor as soon as possible.'' She said ''it's not a program where you can stay in education and training for long periods of time while you look for work.'' She continued: ''Some people have a problem with that. We're not doing that. Under previous programs, that was done. That's not the direction the country is heading.'',But, Shirley Bergert, a lawyer with Connecticut Legal Services in Willimantic, maintained that these families' situation is bad. She said state officials boast that welfare recipients are working. ''The only reason they have this information to report,'' she explained, ''is that families remain poor enough to continue getting assistance.'',The state has started to respond to some organizational problems, while the 1999 General Assembly session will be asked for changes from easing the penalty system to improving access to job training and education for people who have moved out of welfare but are still very poor.,State Representative Christopher Donovan, a Democrat of Meriden and House chairman of the legislature's Labor and Public Employees Committee, says he believes that improving skills would increase recipients' motivation to work and enjoyment of working, and reduce the need for supplemental government aid. ''Right now,'' he said, ''I find it somewhat wasteful that people are being denied going to training programs while they're working or being subsidized by welfare.'' He said he was opposed to recipients' working ''part-time at a burger-flipping joint for 21 months.'' ''When that's over,'' he asked, ''what do you have?'' He added, ''If a person has the ability to be a radiology  technician by going into a two-year program, she can demand a decent salary. Doesn't that do well for society as a whole?'' The executive director of the Regional Workforce Development Board in New Haven, William P. Villano, said that occupational training is  only for recipients who haven't gotten jobs. He said the Federal Government has provided money for additional training and education for people who have gotten work, but it's just getting organized. ''An individual who's working,'' he said, ''has a whole set of day care and transportation problems just around work. To get to some additional training or education presents a second, whole set of logistical problems.'' Mr. Villano said his board plans to work with employers, including St. Raphael's Health Care System in New Haven, to establish on-site training programs to help people advance, and to establish programs in neighborhood centers.,Meanwhile, State Senator Mary Ann Handley, a Democrat of Manchester and Senate chairwoman of the legislature's Human Services Committee, learned that a council established by the 1996 legislature to oversee the welfare program had never met. So, she and the House chairman of the committee, Representative Theresa B. Gerratana, a Democrat of New Britain, recently  got the council together for the first time. Ms. Handley said they would try to determine if the system is working, what problems exist, and if new legislation is needed.,Advocates for women and poor people have expressed great concern for the families who have exited welfare after exhausting benefits. The state has hired the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, of New York City, to conduct follow-up surveys with people whose benefits have been discontinued.,The most recent survey, done after six months off welfare, found 83 percent of its respondents reported working about 35 hours a week in one or more jobs and getting paid an average of $7.83 an hour. But 50.2 percent still need to supplement their earnings with food stamps and 67 percent with Medicaid, because respondents said they could not afford the insurance offered by their employers. To help make ends meet, about 13 percent got food from soup kitchens, food banks or churches. Some 85 percent of respondents said they always had enough to eat. The survey was taken of 500 people in Bridgeport, Hartford, Manchester, New Haven, Norwich and Waterbury.,Dan J. Bloom, a senior research associate with the research group,  said it was difficult to compare Connecticut with other states because  time limits vary. ''Connecticut,'' he said, ''is the place in the country where the most people have reached the time limit.'',Federal welfare reform does not require that states adopt a time limit. But it does put a five-year cap on  Federal money for a family, permitting exceptions for up to 20 percent of the caseload. Mr. Bloom said Michigan, for example, has no time limit, and California's policy will remove adults from the system after five years, but retain their children on the roll.,Of current Connecticut welfare recipients, 50.9 percent have jobs, according to state figures. Of those working, 80 percent are working less than 35 hours, and 39 percent have had their benefits extended beyond the 21-month limit because they  don't earn more than they received on welfare, or they haven't found a job, despite a good-faith effort to do so. The figures show recipients who work earn an average of $6.37 per hour, 72 cents more than the minimum wage.,Social Services Department officials and advocates for the poor said that the first wave of people who went off welfare had higher skills and education, including language proficiency, than those now a part of the caseload. In addition, they said, many current welfare recipients have substance abuse and domestic violence problems as well as a lack of a job history.,But Ms. Wiggett said that it has not been confirmed that current recipients have greater barriers. ''We're just starting to look at statistics to see if it's actually true,'' she said, adding that about half the recipients lack a high school diploma. She insisted, however, that motivation could be as important as education.,As of the end of 1998, state statistics show 34,826 people on state welfare, down from 57,713 when welfare reform took effect in January 1996. To qualify for welfare in most of the state, the income of a family of three must be less than $543 a month.,In November 1997 the first recipients reached the 21-month time limit.  But the process and requirements were changed again in 1998. Responsibility for assessing applicants' qualification for welfare was kept in the State Department of Social Services while, starting last July, the State Labor Department was given responsibility for moving recipients into the work force, and into job-readiness programs. This has meant requiring all recipients to be reassessed by Social Services, then being referred to orientation sessions with the Labor Department and Regional Workforce Development Boards, which are handling job readiness programs.,The transition has not been smooth. The two state agencies initially clashed over procedures and  Ms. Wiggett said that until recently  50 percent of the people referred by the Social Services Department to the Labor Department have not shown up for appointments. And half of those who went to the Labor orientation appointment did not go the next step for job search assistance. As a result, the Labor Department  scheduled one appointment for orientation sessions with its department and Workforce Development Boards, and has started to call recipients to remind them of appointments, like many dentists do for their patients. Ms. Wiggett said that where calls have been made, attendance at appointments has gone up to 70 percent. There are still separate appointments for Social Services and Labor  Ms. Wiggett said.,The system's penalty structure, for example, has triggered criticism. During the first 21 months, if clients violate a requirement of the program, they are penalized with a 20 percent reduction of benefits for three months for the first infraction, 35 percent for three months for the second, and the client is referred to a consultant for a performance contract, where the individual's needs are assessed and goals are established. If the contract isn't complied with, the client's benefits are completely eliminated.,When a recipient's benefits are extended beyond the 21 months, penalties become more severe. The first violation removes the person from welfare and prohibits any future participation in the program, except in the case of a job lost through no fault of the employee.,Donna Campbell, a consultant hired to do performance contracts and provide help to people who have lost their benefits, is executive director of the Employment Success program of the Connecticut Council of  Family Services. She said there are a variety of reasons clients don't show up for appointments, even if they're subject to penalties. She said they include lack of transportation and child care, mental illness, a child's health problems and domestic violence. (The state offers monthly allowances of $9 for transportation and $55 for child care.),She said they're often reluctant to disclose problems because they worry about repercussions such as their children being taken from them. She did acknowledge that there were people who did not have legitimate reasons for missing appointments.,Joanne G. Gibau, a lawyer with New Haven Legal Services, said that she was concerned that people were not given a second chance during the extension even if they've had perfect records in the 21-month period. ''I'm concerned about the kids,'' she said. ''It's not okay with me that for a minor infraction, these kids are barred from getting benefits ever again. What happens if down the road, Mom can't get benefits and doesn't have a job. What happens to the children?'' She said some clients get confused because some appointments are required and others, such as welfare exit interviews, are optional.,But, Claudette J. Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Social Services Department, said her agency's regulations intentionally ''raise the bar''  in the extension period. ''During the first 21 months,'' she said, ''it may take people a little while to understand that we are serious. It may take them a little while to get used to working. But, by the time they reach the extension status, we feel they have a pretty good understanding of what our expectations are.'',She added that the state also didn't want a system ''where people would be abusing the extension process.''  Although there's no limit on extensions, state welfare officials ''do not expect people to continue getting six-month extensions on a perpetual basis,'' she said.,Ms. Wiggett said recipients who have part-time jobs need to attend interviews to help them get more work, in preparation for leaving welfare. ''That's what they might not totally understand,'' she said, ''how different it's going to be after 21 months, how they need to look ahead and increase their earnings.'' She added, ''We don't want to see them go off just barely over the payment standard.'' Ms. Wiggett said the Labor Department is adjusting to its added responsibilities. My feeling is,'' she said, ''it is somewhere between being overwhelmed and it being no big deal.''",PEGGY MCCARTHY,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Rocky Road From Welfare to Work; A System for Making Social Service Recipients Into Employees Remains a Tough Job for Two State Agencies,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/rocky-road-welfare-work-system-for-making-social-service-recipients-into.html
"To the Editor:,Your article on Risa Bramon Garcia [''Casting Herself as Director,'' Feb. 21] brought to mind an incident in the early 1980's, when I was producing a fund-raising benefit for the not-for-profit Ensemble Studio Theater. I was looking for a star performer to generate ticket sales, and so I consulted Risa, who was just beginning her impressive career as a casting director. She pointed me in the direction of a thrilling but little-known club performer who, Risa said, was on the verge of stardom.,This sounded a little like Hollywood hype, and, besides, the name of the performer meant nothing to me. Rejecting Risa's suggestion, I missed the opportunity to showcase Madonna.,When Risa Bramon Garcia speaks, Hollywood had better listen.,SPENCE HALPERIN,New York",,"FEB. 28, 1999",RISA BRAMON GARCIA; An Eye for Talent,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/movies/l-risa-bramon-garcia-an-eye-for-talent-500127.html
"Their heads shaved, their boots polished, hundreds of young men marched into the cathedral square of this central German town today chanting ''Glory and honor to the Waffen SS.'',Police officers, arrayed around the square with shields and water cannons, immediately issued a warning to the neo-Nazi rightists: ''We will arrest anyone who goes on chanting this slogan.'' It is a crime in Germany to exalt the deeds of the Nazis.,The demonstrators, mostly members of Germany's rightist National Democratic Party, quickly switched their tack, raising their voices to demand ''Work for Germans first'' and declaring: ''The national resistance is marching here.'',The extreme right remains marginal in Germany, hemmed in by all sorts of constitutional restrictions. But, although small, it is growing, especially in former East German towns like this one where unemployment is rampant. And the extremists appear to be highly organized and determined.,Today, beneath the unseasonal sunshine of Magdeburg, close to 1,000 rightists deployed around a square with the precision of a paramilitary organization. Older men, wearing brown leather coats betraying a nostalgia for the Gestapo, directed the movements of younger men, most skinheads in their late teens and early 20's with a taste for black leather jackets and big boots.,It is in these two age groups -- the embittered old and the angry young -- that right-wing organizations have recently proved most successful in finding recruits. They can exploit the frustrations of older people who have known nothing but authoritarian rule and now have neither work nor prospects, and of school-leavers who find no job openings or apprenticeships as German unemployment rises.,''We have doubled our membership to over 6,500 in three years and we will rise to power in this country,'' said Steffen Hupka, the regional leader of the National Democratic Party. ''We stand for German values, German culture, and against the guilt complex imposed on us by powerful groups, especially in the United States.'',In his leather jacket, with a cellular phone in each breast pocket, Mr. Hupka was very much the modern agitator, measuring his words but leaving no doubt of his revolutionary intentions.,Many in his party, he noted, did not believe the Holocaust ever happened, ''but I will not give my own view because I could be arrested.'',Unemployment in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where Magdeburg is located, is running at close to 20 percent. One banner raised today said, ''Turkey for the Turks, Germany for the Germans,'' an allusion to the large numbers of Turkish guest workers in Germany. Most such workers are in the west of the country and not in the formerly Communist east.,Another banner said, ''Multi-culturalism equals genocide.'' A third showed a photograph of a young blonde girl with wide eyes and braids, who might have been lifted from a Nazi propaganda movie: ''Does she have a future in this country?'' it asked.,Economic problems in the former East Germany have clearly helped the rightists enormously, especially in combination with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's pledge to open the way for many of Germany's 7.3 million foreigners to become German citizens. Indeed the formal reason for today's demonstration was a protest against proposed new immigration laws.,The gathering underscored the way the issue of immigration has prompted an unlikely coming-together of the moderate right and the extreme right, if only on this issue. The Christian Democrats have organized a highly effective petition against Mr. Schroder's initial pledge -- now hastily dropped -- to allow foreigners to hold dual nationality.,Klaus Ramm, a 56-year-old construction worker who lost his job six months ago, said he had voted for the Christian Democrats in the last election but now felt drawn to the National Democrats.,''People my age no longer have a chance,'' he said, ''and foreigners are pouring in. At least these people stand for German ideals.'',As close to 2,000 police officers surrounded the square and circled overheard in helicopters, Mr. Ramm commented acidly: ''If the German police checked our borders as well as they check all of us, we'd be a lot better off.'',A court decision in Magdeburg early today prevented the rightists from marching through the town and confined them to the square. At the same time, a counterdemonstration was held by left-wing organizations that featured a rock concert and signs saying: ''No human being is illegal.'',Reinhard Hoppner, the Prime Minister of Saxony-Anhalt, addressed the counterdemonstration, saying that he protested against ''this attempt to abuse the necessary discussion about a reform of the citizenship law for fueling xenophobia.'',But it seemed clear today that much more than the immigration issue lay behind the rightist rally. There was also disillusionment at the difficult integration of East and West Germany, a process that has left many Germans angry at what they see as the false promises of western capitalism.,Half-way between the rightist rally and the counterdemonstration, a fashion show was held in Magdeburg's new shopping mall. But the glitzy models, the surrounding fast-food restaurants, and the overflowing mounds of fruit, cheese and salami in stores could not mask the city's uneasy passage from a recent Communist past to a strained present.,One young man, the word ''skinhead'' tattooed into his head, and ''White Brotherhood'' emblazoned on his leather jacket, held aloft a photograph of a helmeted soldier.,''Our fathers in the Wehrmacht were not criminals,'' it said.",ROGER COHEN,"FEB. 28, 1999",Right-Wing March Showcases Germany's Disenchanted,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/world/right-wing-march-showcases-germany-s-disenchanted.html
"I WALKED into East Japanese Restaurant and immediately began relaxing. For one thing, I was walking around in my socks. For another, I was headed for a low table surrounded by sunken seats, both finished in a dark, soothing polished wood. On our way, the host led me past an inviting central kitchen whose focal point was a wood-fire grill steaming with the flavors of freshly cooked shrimp and eggplant.,It felt good to slide under the table and sit on a soft pillow, with the  restaurant bustling around me and a stone waterfall bubbling behind me.,Unfortunately, my server immediately brought me out of this comfortable atmosphere into a world less tranquil and more stop-and-go. Unwieldy plastic menus were left carelessly on the table, and we had to request water. Our appetizers came out from the kitchen one at a time, indicating that the server was not aware of the importance of the whole dining experience, but instead was preoccupied with getting the food to the table. This distracted attitude and staggered pace continued throughout the meal, as dirty dishes piled up and soiled dessert menus were delivered, creating an unhappy sense of having to personally maintain order at one's own table.,Once I noticed a few problems with the service, I became preoccupied with looking for more, rather than enjoying the meal and company at hand. Unfortunately, I found them.,In general, East could use a little spring cleaning. Sparkling wood floors would be a start for all those  stockinged feet. And although the complimentary flip flops positioned near the restrooms provide a kind service, East should house them in a  neat set of cubbies rather than haphazardly scattering them about. While they're at it, the managers of East should upgrade the plates and cutlery. Finally, the servers should care more about table maintenance, With just a little bit of sprucing up,  East can come back strong.,Fortunately, East still lures people in for its food. While some of the menu, too, could be more finely tuned, for the most part the food is fresh tasting, artfully presented and full of flavor.,The kinoko soup for two, served in an attractive iron soup pot, is a clear, aromatic and intensely ''mushroomy'' soup, studded with broccoli florets and sliced button, shiitake and oyster mushrooms. This is an ample portion, which actually serves as a refreshing palate cleanser if you can pace yourself and savor it slowly throughout the rest of the appetizers.,Shrimp shumai has always been a favorite of mine, and East's little steamed packages were somehow more delicate than any I've tried before. They must have been filled with a cube of vegetable stock as each bite flooded my mouth with a burst of flavorful liquid. I did not even consider dipping my shumai in soy sauce, as it would certainly have masked the crisp flavor of the ginger, the crunch of the cabbage and the saltiness of the shrimp.,I've also eaten a lot of gyoza, but none have compared to the the roasted root-vegetable taste of these half-moon shaped pockets. Unlike most gyoza, these spinach dumplings did not get soggy as they cooled. Instead, they became firm, pleasantly chewy and truly excellent.,The seaweed salad was very different from those I've come to love. Rather than a straight portion of seaweed, the East version was  mixed greens with seaweed draped on top. The soy and ginger dressing, served on the side, was thick and sweet, but did not singlehandedly rescue the salad from its bland ingredients. Similarly, the negima, or beef and scallion broiled with teriyaki sauce, was a weak execution of this popular dish. The beef had an unappealing gray hue, the scallions inside were raw, and the flavors did not meld together.,The sushi was very good, although I momentarily hesitated before clipping a piece of tuna between my chopsticks. It did not have a wet fresh sheen and I wondered whether it had been cut hours earlier rather than per order. The yellowtail and the eel quickly lured me back as each piece of sushi was its own perfect meal: large pieces of fish draped over neat pads of rice, artfully displayed, as smooth as butter, and brimming with the taste of the sea.,I would recommend experimenting with the assortment of original, regular, fashion (dressed up with a lettuce hat) and spicy rolls offered at East. The A.A.C. roll (asparagus, avocado and cucumber) was a perfect combination for vegetarian sushi, providing color, flavor, texture and most importantly, substance. The spicy tuna roll was creamy, hot and filling -- often a hard trio to locate when eating sushi. Finally, the natto roll both surprised and perplexed my group. I love soybeans but have never tried them mixed with scallion in a roll; they are gummy, bland, salty, satisfying and curious all at the same time. Skip the ume shiso roll, or plum with mint leaves. Just as I feel that hot wasabi paste should not cross over as a pizza topping, mint should probably not be associated with sushi.,As in most Japanese restaurants, the dessert is not a primary focus. Both the green tea and ginger ice cream tasted store-bought, which is acceptable but not exciting. I would have preferred fresh citrus or a final sip of my Kirin beer.,It's not too early to be thinking about spring cleaning of my own. Everyone can benefit from taking a step back and taking a fresh look at their surroundings. By fixing just a few details, East should have no problem keeping diners at ease throughout their Japanese feast.,East Japanese Restaurant,1405 Teaneck Road, Teaneck,(201) 837-1260,SATISFACTORY,ATMOSPHERE -- Comfortable, but needs some sprucing up.,SERVICE -- Distracted and unorganized.,RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Kinoko soup for two, shrimp shumai, vegetable gyoza, yellowtail sushi, A.A.C. roll (asparagus, avocado and cucumber), spicy tuna roll, natto roll (sticky soy beans and scallion).,SMOKING -- In main dining room, not at bar.,PRICE RANGE -- Soup, $1.75 to $7.50; appetizers, $2.95 to $9.75; sushi and sashimi, $1.25 to $3.50; salads, $1.75 to $5.50; entrees, $8.50 to $15; platters, $9.75 to $37 for the biggest sushi-sashimi combination.,HOURS -- Mondays to Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M.and 5 to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, noon to 10:30 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 10 P.M.,RESERVATIONS -- None permitted on Saturdays.,CREDIT CARDS -- All majors accepted.,WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- None available, as all tables are sunken.,RATINGS -- Poor to Satisfactory, Good, Very Good, Excellent, Extraordinary.,Ratings reflect the reviewer's reaction to food, ambiance and service, with price taken into consideration.

"In ''Renewal, Sure, But Villages Say Families First'' [Feb. 21], you mention some of the improvements going on in Patchogue but do not report on the impact the project will have on families.,The Patchogue Village Board in conjunction with the Suffolk County Planning Board recently announced that they want to extend West Avenue in Patchogue to the riverfront. They say it would cost them $2.3 million, 80 percent of it coming from a Federal transportation grant. Most of the money would be used to buy out the residents of at least 12 homes that sit in the way of the extension. Other residents whose homes would not be destroyed would find themselves living in a business zone next to a main street.,The village would lose the tax income from at least 12 properties, the remaining families who bought homes in a quiet neighborhood will now live next to a busy main street, and residents who have lived here 30 years or more will be thrown out so tourists can travel down to the waterfront without making a turn. Patchogue calls this riverfront revitalization.,There are already two perfectly good roads leading to the riverfront: South Ocean Avenue and Cedar Avenue. They, like the majority of streets in Patchogue, are in sad need of repair. Instead of fixing these problems the village is using $2.3 million to build another road.,M.

"A $60 billion bid by the No. 2 Italian phone company, Olivetti S.p.A., for Telecom Italia was given a green light to move forward today, when Italian stock market regulators ruled that it was legally admissible.,The ruling came two days after Telecom Italia's chairman, Franco Bernabe, won boardroom backing for what is expected to be a long and bitter corporate battle, unaccustomed for the Italian business world and reminiscent of big American hostile buyouts of the 1980's.,Olivetti's assault on Telecom is the first test case to come under new Italian takeover legislation, enacted last summer, that weakens the defenses that companies here traditionally used to fend off aggressive raiders. As a result, many believe that Olivetti's move clears the path for future corporate predators.,The huge hostile bid, the largest ever in European business, has split the center-left Government of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist. The Italian state holds a 3.4 percent stake in Telecom. The Italian Treasury, which formally controls the shares, argues for neutrality, but other ministers have said the Government must assure that a key national asset like Telecom, the former state phone monopoly, does not fall into foreign hands.,Last Monday, Olivetti's original bid -- in cash, stock and bonds -- met a setback, when the regulator, Consob, ruled that it failed to meet requirements set by Italian takeover law.,Olivetti officials worked feverishly to reconfigure the bid. In a statement today, the regulators ruled that Olivetti's revised bid was ''such as to furnish the market the information necessary for the bid,'' which could now go ahead sometime in April.,Spokesmen for both companies, reached by phone, declined to comment.,For Olivetti, the ruling means that it will now have to submit a formal prospectus, which it expects to do in about a month.,For Telecom, the ruling imposes narrower room for maneuvering against Olivetti, which is one-fifth the size of its larger rival.,At its meeting Thursday, Telecom's board dismissed Olivetti's reconfigured bid as riddled with ''formal and substantial shortcomings,'' including the absence of a deadline for the bid and an explanation of how the bid's debt financing would affect Telecom Italia's debt and development outlook.,In its statement today, Consob said that its ruling meant that the ''period of offering'' had begun, and that as a consequence Telecom would have to ''abstain from fulfilling any acts and operations that would block the achievement of the objectives of the bid,'' unless they were approved by at least 30 percent of a Telecom shareholder assembly.,On Thursday, Telecom's board unanimously gave Mr. Bernabe a mandate to examine the possibility of merging Telecom with its mobile phone unit, Telecom Italia Mobile. The combination would have the aim of raising the value of the entire group to put it out of Olivetti's reach.,On Friday, in a sign of investor disappointment that Olivetti did not sweeten its revised bid, Telecom Italia's stock fell 0.145 euros to 9.59 euros, or $10.54, after rising Wednesday above the 10 euro per share price Olivetti is offering.,Olivetti's first offer was rejected by Consob partly because it was conditional on the sale of the company's existing phone units to Mannesmann A. G. of Germany. Today, Consob said Olivetti had put no direct conditions on its revised offer.",JOHN TAGLIABUE,"FEB. 28, 1999",Regulators Give Green Light to Olivetti's Bid for Telecom Italia,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/world/regulators-give-green-light-to-olivetti-s-bid-for-telecom-italia.html
"To the Sports Editor:,Joe Lapointe (''The Great Weight Hindering the Rangers' Rebuilding Efforts,'' The Times, Feb. 19) fails to mention the most important point about Neil Smith, the Rangers' president and general manager.,In regard to his evident job security despite his utter failure in drafts and trades, the largest reason that Smith enjoys such a lack of threat is that no one above him knows or cares anything about hockey. Not Dave Checketts, and certainly no one at Cablevision.,Those higher than Smith are exclusively concerned with the Knicks. The 18,200 tickets that sell for Rangers games 41 times a year are seemingly meaningless, so it stands to reason that Smith's job is not endangered.,While Smith's superiors are not at the end of their patience with his incessant blundering, most of my fellow fans certainly are.,CRISTI CARMODY,Brooklyn",,"FEB. 28, 1999",Rangers' Smith Insulated at Top,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/l-rangers-smith-insulated-at-top-548030.html

"THE Connecticut Parent-Teacher Association has moved out of brownie baking and into the political arena. The state P.T.A.'s 58,000 members have political positions adopted by the national organization of 6.9 million members and their own state positions as well. ''We have a lot of clout,'' declared Sally A. Boske, the president of the Connecticut association.,The association is supporting some of President Clinton's initiatives such as early literacy and early childhood education, infrastructure repairs and especially ''having education in the forefront'' said Ms. Boske.,New positions are added each year. And others, controversial issues like full-day kindergarten, tenure and lengthening the school day or year, are under continuous discussion for possible new organizational positions. The bedrock position of the P.T.A. has not changed. ''Parental involvement. That's our big message,'' said Ms. Boske.,Recently Ms. Boske talked about the role of parents in schools and her hopes for greater parental involvement in education. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.,Q. What methods does the P.T.A. use to encourage parental involvement?,A. We pride ourselves on the training that we offer to show you how to get onto the decision-making teams. We also pride ourselves in saying you don't push your way in. There's a way to do it. There's a chain of command, there's a method and we will train you in that method. One of the most important things is to be really knowledgeable about what's going on so you have the respect of your community.,Q. What does the P.T.A. offer to members?,A.  The training that I've gotten through P.T.A. has not only helped me with children's issues and the issues of schools, but in my everyday life. I do things in my life that I just never thought I could do.,One of the things that we firmly believe in is getting the knowledge out, looking at all sides of a story, understanding an issue. Then you can make an intelligent decision because you have all the information in front of you.,We have people that have really different views. We don't all think alike and it's real great to share all those different views and then come to a consensus and do the best we can for the kids.,Q. Does the P.T.A. have a position statement about boards of education?,A. The Connecticut P.T.A. has an important position in favor of nonpartisan boards of education. We firmly believe that politics should not play a role in our children's education. We are working on trying to get that through legislation.,Q. But education has become a hot political issue. How does the P.T.A. feel about that?,A. I think that's great. They have finally figured out that our kids are our future. If we don't keep them healthy, keep them safe, keep them educated, then what kind of future is our country going to have?,It makes much more sense spending money on educating that child than putting that adult into prison.,Q. Do you think you have lost a member if he or she goes onto the school board?,A. We think that's pretty good. From what I have seen when parents become school board members they are usually nonpartisan. They have been brought up in that nonpartisan environment of P.T.A. and that thinking seems to follow through. The more parents we can get on school boards the more nonpartisan they will be and we'll reach that goal of having a nonpartisan board of education.,The State Board of Education includes us on quite a few decision-making teams and committees. I have been helping them with the fight to get the students on the board. We have such a say in decision making that I haven't given much thought to being on the Board as a parent.,Q. Is the P.T.A. still running bake sales?,A. There's a need for all different types of things in the school system. There is no denying that fund-raisers are needed to get the things done that your school wants to accomplish,  your parents want to accomplish. You need to have money for them. That's the bottom line.,We firmly believe that you figure out what you would like to do for the school year, then decide how you are going to get the money to do that. Not the other way around. We understand that fund-raising has to be done but you should do it for a purpose.,Q. Is it difficult for the P.T.A. to muster the volunteers they need?,A. There are many ways that people can help. You don't have to come to a meeting. You don't have to come to the school. There are many things that you can do if you are creative enough to recognize them.,For example, there's the new Mom at home with a computer. When the baby is napping she might love to do your newsletter.,There might be a Dad who has an accounting background who would have no problem doing your budget and running your books. He's just not going to come to the meeting to decide what color napkins you're going to use at the ice cream social. You need to recognize that there are these people.,There are different levels of involvement. Making sure that you let parents know that in second grade this is the reading list so you can read to your child at home is important. That parent becomes just as involved as the parent who comes to school and shelves library books.,Q. What is the P.T.A.'s position on school vouchers?,A. We feel that we have to consider all children, not just a few. Taking a few out of public school may help them but what about the ones left behind? They suffer because money is being taken out and so is the cream of the crop.,I firmly believe if a problem exists, then fix it. Public schools have had problems for many years. You can't expect solutions overnight. It's important that we keep at it and make sure there is adequate funding.,Q. Is more generous funding the answer to most school woes?,A. It's not just money. Groups of concerned people can do a lot. Parents should be in the forefront. Studies show that when parents are involved students do better.,I think there are lots of barriers. It's not always easy for parents to be involved. If a parent had a bad time in school they might not be able to come back. The last generation was brought up to believe teachers and principals were the bosses and they just can't go to them for help.,There may be a language barrier. Quite a few students are English as a Second Language. Their parents have the same barrier. Some parents cannot read. There is embarrassment about that. The school has to reach out to those parents, too.,Schools can use the buddy system. Somebody in the school knows two or three parents who don't speak English well but can communicate in their own language. Find someone who knows the language, knock on their door and say 'Did you know this is going on in school?',All the high schools would love to translate your newsletter into Spanish. This could be a class project for a Spanish class. Or a college in your town could help. Maybe a class could write something in Polish and put it on a Web site.,Q. Most parents work 9 to 5 and cannot get to schools during the workday. How can that parent be involved?,A. Some have trouble getting out of work although more and more employers recognize how important it to be involved in schools. If a parent asks, the employer may say yes, but they might be afraid to ask. Sometimes time is a problem. Teachers and principals have families and are entitled to have a family life. Everyone has to give a little and compromise.,Q. How does the P.T.A. view charter schools?,A. Charter schools in Connecticut, for the most part, are working wonderfully. The State Department of Education has firm rules to start a charter school and strong regulations to continue. We don't hear the horror stories that we hear from the rest of the country. Here in Connecticut most are great and a few are floundering.",NANCY POLK,"FEB. 28, 1999",Q&A/Sally A.

"THE charter school movement has arrived in Westchester, and if a group put together by Elaine C. Young of Purchase has its way, a school where the curriculum is designed by children based on their interests will be opening in the county a year from September.,Under a law passed late last year by the state, the Board of Regents and the State University of New York may each grant 50 charters for schools established by parents, educators or civic or community groups. A charter school is similar to a public school because it is financed with tax dollars, but it is like a private school because it is more independent. Proponents say the movement will encourage innovation and make regular public schools better; detractors say it will divert needed money from the public schools.,Ms. Young was a teacher for 30 years (Bay Shore, the Laboratory School at New Paltz, Scarsdale, Harrison), mainly second grade, and is the author of the book ''I Am a Blade of Grass'' (Jalmar Press) in which she details what she calls her ''interest-based learning theory.'' She is the first one in Westchester to submit a preliminary application for a charter school. She now has to submit a detailed application to either the Regents or the State University of New York, have it approved and then find a site for a school. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with her:,Q. Why are you so interested in charter schools?,A. All of my teaching was based on what the children were interested in, and I wanted the children to love what they learned and learn what they loved. In that way, they exceeded the standards required of them, and they were able to see that the skills, knowledge and information that we wanted them to learn were the ones they were using in their projects. What we did was project based, team based and theme based, but decided by the children with a very strong involvement of their parents. My classroom was more like an exploritorium.,The charter school movement began in 1990 in Minnesota, and the first charter school was built in 1991. I started to go to different conferences and visited charter schools, and I saw it was a wonderful opportunity to show what it looked like to have the children fully participating in designing their own learning.,Charter schools are about individual schools. They're not about school districts. I've been to many school board meetings, and often you hear people with different agendas. Not that they were wrong, but one says  let's spend the money on construction; another says let's spend the money on sports, another on technology. A charter school is a smaller, individual school where everyone shares the vision of the charter school. So you don't have those large divisions. I see the charter schools as -- this is a funny way to say it -- the sweat equity. Let us try out some of these ideas and see which of these ideas we can adapt.,Q. What is your vision for your charter school?,A. The vision is to have the children involved in the design of their own learning based on their interests, because jobs are not what they used to be. The world is project based, team based, flexible. The children would be involved in the planning, design and the setup of the school, and it would be a very demanding inquiry process throughout the grades, and the children will demonstrate and see a use for the skills, knowledge and information that we want them to know and how it is applied to life. We still have to meet the new standards of New York State.,Q. What has to be done to set up a charter school?,A. Connecticut and New Jersey passed similar charter school laws before New York, so I learned a lot of lessons with those laws. I had tried to start a charter school in Greenwich. But the lesson I learned was that I didn't really form the team; I didn't share this with every person from the top down, so basically I was told when I submitted my proposal that it was an extraordinary idea. ''However, we already have good schools; you're taking our money.'' In Connecticut, you submitted an application to a local school district. In New York, you submit it to one of the two sponsoring agencies: Board of Regents or the Board of the State University of New York, which each can approve 50. Also, there can be an unlimited amount of conversions of public schools to charter schools. For example, New York City's School Chancellor Rudy Crew, if he had the support of a majority of teachers and parents in a particular area, could convert a public school to a charter.,What it means if you form or convert to a charter school is, first of all, there is no voucher, no tuition, no admission tests and it's inclusive. But each charter school also has a specific vision and mission. One could be just for the arts, another for technology, as mine would be based on children's interests. They can be high school, middle school, very diverse. The parents and the teachers and the students share the vision because they choose to be there.,Q. So the team does the paperwork and submits it either to the State University of New York or the Regents?,A. Right. My team is going over the proposal that I have been adapting and adapting. There is a support structure in New York State that is really extraordinary. There is a New York Charter School Resource Center. Gerry Vasquez is the president of it, and he came to one of the meetings. He is there to help out with the application, which must be submitted by Oct. 1. The academic standards of the state must be equaled or exceeded. A charter can be given for up to five years and then has to be renewed.,Q. So you have to say in your application how you are going to do spelling, how you are teaching math, and so on?,A. Right. You have the responsibility and autonomy of how to teach, but the children must meet the standards of New York State. Our children will be responsible and accountable and do the thinking, because decision making is a very important piece, and do the reflecting every day in the classroom.,Q. If your school is physically in, say, the Harrison area, will it be open to children from the rest of county?,A. That is one of the things that we are investigating. We want our charter school to be a diverse community so that it would attract students from anywhere in Westchester County. We are investigating sites. There are many unused buildings around that could be renovated for a school. One of the most important things we're going to need is a financial manager. Of all the 1,200 to 1,500 charter schools across the county in 33 states, the ones that fail -- and there are not that many -- are the ones that were not fiscally well managed.,Q. What size will your school be?,A. I'd like to start small with just a kindergarten, second-  and fourth-grade class, no more than 50 children at the most. And the kindergarten teacher would the following year take the children on to first grade, and the second grade teacher would take the children on to the third grade, the fourth-grade teacher to the next year, and the school could expand, bringing in new kindergarten, second-  and fourth-grade classes.,Q. How is it determined exactly how much tax money follows the student to a charter school?,A. It's not very clear yet. It's called the ''average from the district that they're coming from.'' Although there is Federal funding that might also go with the child to the charter school.,Q. Can one say, I want to set up a school for gifted children. I'm going to have IQ tests or whatever?,A. No. Charter schools are inclusive. As a matter of fact, most of the charter schools that will be chartered are going to support mainly children at risk.,Q. Is this going to be the death of public schools, as some opponents suggest?,A. Not only won't it be the death, but for me it will be the bridge of communications. This will not destroy public education, but it will impact it, the systemic changes that we're talking about. I see the charter school as a living laboratory. The heart of the matter is that the charter school does not have the regulations that sometimes prevent innovation in the public schools.,Q. Where does the teacher's union come into this?,A. Let's say a teacher wants to leave a school they're at, they can take up to a two-year leave of absence. In a charter school, a certain percentage of the teaching staff does not have to be certified so that you can use people with great expertise who are not teachers. Remember, if you do not meet the state's standards -- say on the new fourth-grade test --  then the charter can be taken away and the school closed.",DONNA GREENE,"FEB. 28, 1999",Q&A/Elaine C.

"Driving at Age 70 and Over,Q. My wife and I are in our early 70's and are planning a trip to Ireland and Wales. A friend cautioned us about restrictions that some car rental companies have on providing cars for septuagenarians. Are we likely to be refused because of our age? -- Stanley Myers, Blue Hill, Me.,A. Because age restrictions vary from one company to another, there is a chance you could be rejected. To avoid having a monkey wrench thrown into your plans at the last minute, it's best to tell your car rental company, travel agent or broker before you leave your age, especially since limits in the same company may differ. The reason for the age restriction, the car rental companies say, is a limit set by insurers.,Here, listed alphabetically, are the policies of major car rental companies and brokers. Brokers use cars provided by several companies and can direct you to a company that will accept a driver your age.,AutoEurope, (800) 223-5555. The  suppliers in Ireland are Hertz, with an upper age limit of 79, and Europcar, which has a maximum of 75. (The limit for Hertz cars is, indeed, higher than if rented directly from Hertz.) In Wales the suppliers are Europcar, which has a limit of 69, and Avis, which has no limit.,Avis, (800) 331-1212. In Ireland, drivers from 66 to 74 years old can rent the company's less expensive cars, from, say, a Nissan Micro to a midsize automatic like a Toyota Carina; age 74 is the maximum. In Wales, there is no age restriction.,Budget, (800) 527-0700, has corporate and licensee owners, all under the name Budget, with varying age limits. In Ireland, the maximum ranges from 75 to 80 and in Wales from 65 to 70.,Hertz, (800) 654-3131. In Ireland, the maximum is 74. In Wales, there is no limit.,Kemwel Holiday, a broker, uses two suppliers in Ireland: Eurodollar, with a maximum of 70, and Sixt, with a maximum of 75. In Wales, the cars come from National/Alamo, which has a maximum of 80.,Thrifty, (800) 367-2277. In Ireland and Wales, the oldest a driver can be is 70.,Bugs in the Caribbean,Q. Because we were being eaten alive by bugs, my husband and I stopped going to Guadeloupe after a January vacation about 15 years ago. My husband was intensely allergic, and none of the usual bug repellents seemed to have any effect. Are there new, more effective repellents? Or are there other islands where we would encounter no bug problems? -- Carolyn W. Sanger, Potomac, Md.,A. Actually, the high season in the Caribbean, generally from around December to mid-March or so, is when one is least likely to encounter bugs. And the problem is hardly limited to Guadeloupe since the same species of bugs are common throughout the coastal tropics of the Western Hemisphere, according to Dr. Paul Reiter, chief of the entymology section of the dengue branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in San Juan, P.R.,Even so, he said, there may have been very good reasons you encountered bugs, which, broadly speaking, includes biting flies. One is that you were probably out when the bugs do their most intense biting -- starting 30 to 45 minutes after sunset and continuing for 30 to 45 minutes. ''At that time, it's best to have your rum and Coke in a screened place,'' Dr. Reiter suggested.,Another possibility, he said, is that you had the bad luck to be vacationing after a heavy rainfall and high tides. That is when some of the most voracious offenders breed in salt marshes and mangrove swamps.,Or perhaps smell may also have played a role. Scientists have found that mosquitoes are attracted to some people by such things as carbon dioxide and lactic acid.,Dr. Reiter, who has lived in Puerto Rico for a dozen years, offers these suggestions: Stay out of the way at the wrong time of day; wear a long-sleeved shirt, which he concedes may be unrealistic for people on vacation in a warm climate, and apply a repellent containing DEET, which is widely regarded as the most effective repellent and which has been used for more than 40 years.,As helpful as DEET is, remember that perspiration and swimming diminish its effectiveness. DEET is available in varying concentrations. Ten to 35 percent -- with 10 percent being the maximum for children -- usually suffices.,Barging in Belgium,Q. I would like information about river or barge cruising on a trip to include Bruges and to end in Brussels. I read that a barge called the Rembrandt might offer such a trip.  -- G.K. Bellis, The Woodlands, Tex.,A. A number of companies offer the basic barge trip aboard the Rembrandt, which carries 18 to 20 passengers, plus transportation to and from Brussels. At least one has a more inclusive package.,Among the stops are Bruges, for a visit to the market square, the Basilica of the Holy Blood (parts of which date from the 12th and 15th centuries) and the Memling Museum; Oudenaarde, to see 14th-century tapestries; Ghent, to see the St. Bavo Cathedral and ''The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb'' by Jan and Hubert van Eyck, and Antwerp, to visit the diamond center and the Rubens House. Crossing into the Netherlands, the barge stops at the fortress town of Willemstad; Gouda, for visits to St. John's Cathedral and a cheese shop, and Terneuzen.,Note that dates of availability may change and that the itinerary runs from Bruges to Terneuzen and sometimes the reverse. Brussels is about an hour's drive from Bruges and about 90 minutes from Terneuzen.,A package that includes two nights in Brussels at the start plus a half-day tour of Brussels led by an expert is available from IST Cultural Tours, 225 West 34th Street, New York, N.Y. 10122; (800) 833-2111 or (212) 563-1202. In addition, the expert provides commentary, from a historical or architectural perspective, on the day of arrival. The cost between May 30 and Aug. 1 is $1,575, based on double occupancy. This price and the one below include all meals aboard the barge and all admissions.,Among the companies offering the barge component, at $1,690 a person, for double occupancy, are these:,Abercrombie & Kent, 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 65023; (800) 323-7308 or (630) 954-2944.,Barge Broker prefers to deal through a travel agent; 2321 30th Street, Boulder, Colo. 80301; (800) 275-9794, fax (303) 447-2487.,The Barge Lady, 101 West Grand Avenue, Suite 200, Chicago, Ill. 60610; (800) 880-0071 or (312) 245-0900, fax (312) 245-0952.

"Dealing With Noisy Neighbors,Q.  When I came to New York 40 years ago, I heard about a law that restricted the noise that one can make in one's apartment to no farther than three feet from outside one's window. I never saw anything in print about this, but it sounds like a good idea since I am now bothered by tenants in an apartment four floors above me whose loud conversations at 3 o'clock in the morning keep me awake even though my windows are tightly shut. If the noise law exists, how is it enforced? . . . Ann Clothier, Brooklyn.,A.  Cathy DelliCarpini, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, said that restrictions on noise levels in the city are established by the city's Noise Code.,''There is no language in the code that stipulates that the noise one makes in one's residence cannot extend three feet outside the premises,'' Ms. DelliCarpini said. She added that while the code addresses noise pollution from such sources as audio systems, commercial establishments and air-circulation devices, and establishes different maximum decibel levels for day and night, it does not establish a specific ''neighbor-to-neighbor'' noise standard.,Ms. DelliCarpini said that the only part of the code that might be of help in regulating such a problem would be the ''unnecessary noise'' clause. ''The code defines unnecessary noise as that which annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, health or safety of a person or which causes damage to a property or business,'' she said.,Ms. DelliCarpini said that residents can file complaints about unreasonable noise with the Department of Environmental Protection at any time by calling (718) 337-4357.,''Inspectors will be dispatched to the premises to determine if the situation constitutes unreasonable noise under the Noise Code and whether a violation can be issued,'' she said.,Operating Budget In a Co-op,Q.  I live in a Mitchell-Lama co-op that comes under the supervision of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. If I am refused a copy of the co-op's operating budget by the board of directors and managing agent, can I request a copy from H.P.D. under the Freedom of Information Act? . . . Thomas J. Smith, the Bronx.,A.  Howard Schechter, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law, said that the regulations governing Mitchell-Lama co-ops -- the ''Rules and Regulations Governing City-Aided Limited Profit Housing Companies of the City of New York'' -- require the co-op to give shareholders access to its financial records as well as the operating budget and financial statement.,''This requirement is usually satisfied by distribution of the audited financial statement to the cooperators,'' Mr. Schechter said. ''This package usually includes a balance sheet, operating statement and related schedules, as well as a copy of the budget for the coming year.'',He said that while the Freedom of Information Act could probably be used to obtain copies of documents filed with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it is not likely that such a request would be necessary.,Instead, Mr. Schechter said, the shareholder should send a written request for the documents to the co-op's board. If that fails to resolve the problem, Mr. Schechter said, the shareholder should then file a complaint with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, making sure to include a copy of the written request that had been sent to the board.,''That should be sufficient to obtain assistance,'' he said.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",Q. & A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/q-a-465402.html
"''There are two schools of thought on maternity clothes,'' said Katherine Betts, the fashion news director of Vogue, who is expecting a baby in June. ''The one that says you should wear a tent and hide. Or the French school, which says you should show off your pregnancy. Pregnant Frenchwomen are incredibly chic.'' For pregnant Americans, Liz Lange Maternity opened a store this month upstairs at 1020 Lexington Avenue (73d Street). Ms. Lange, a former Vogue editor, has sold her body-hugging line from a showroom to luminaries like Elle Macpherson, Cindy Crawford and Elisabeth Shue. Ms. Lange said her clothes are ''skintight, but they'll stretch to fit from conception to delivery.'' Now, less famous women with equally great expectations may buy her tiny T-shirts ($85) and low-rider bootleg pants ($175), which button under the stomach. ''Women don't realize that they look smaller if they're wearing smaller clothes,'' Ms. Betts said, but cautioned that ''you can't be the self-conscious type.''

"Almost three years ago, when Sarah Lichtman and Rachel Kueny opened Astro Turf, a boutique of 1950's bric-a-brac at 290 Smith Street, neighbors didn't get it. ''So they'd bring us their junk -- like old stoves,'' Ms. Lichtman said. Astro Turf is no longer an anomaly on Smith Street. In recent months, the nondescript four-block row straddling Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens has turned into a hip strip catering to young people who have immigrated to this Italian-Spanish neighborhood in the last two years. An island of cute dress shops and upscale restaurants has emerged in a sea of bodegas and beauty parlors.

"With 1 minute 40 seconds remaining in tonight's game between the Nets and the Boston Celtics, ''The Heat Is On'' pumped through the Continental Arena speakers. It was a fitting, if unfortunate, choice of music: the Nets were once again falling before an opponent's late-game charge, making changes on the bench and on the court appear necessary.,In one more sign that Coach John Calipari's club is in dire straits, the Nets lost to the Celtics by 101-92 before a befuddled crowd of 20,049. It was the Nets' sixth straight defeat, dropping their record to 2-10 -- the franchise's worst start since it entered the National Basketball Association in 1976 -- and making Calipari's job security, despite pre-game assurances from the team's owners, seem at least a little bit shaky.,Losing to the mediocre Celtics, who brought in a 5-5 record and were playing their third game in four nights, was intolerable. Especially when Boston was without Ron Mercer, out with a sprained ankle, and when the Nets, playing on two days' rest, had led by 14 points in the second quarter.,Why has a supposed Eastern Conference contender become an Atlantic Division doormat? There seem to be three possibilities: the Nets are not as good as previously thought; Calipari has lost his team's ear, or the third-year coach is not directing his team properly, particularly in the clutch, when the Nets, who have held fourth-quarter leads in five of their last six losses, are being crushed.,''They played hard,'' Calipari said, denying the suggestion that his players are not responding to him. ''They finished the game out and they're trying. I think they're playing. It's just that we're not making plays. If you think that's not responding to me, I guess you can consider that.,''How many layups did we miss today? Is that because they're not responding to me? I don't think so. I think we're just not making the plays we can make. Now we have to go back and keep them positive that we can do this. It's getting to never-never land here shortly.'',The players appeared to be firmly in Calipari's corner. Sam Cassell, who missed his eighth game with a sprained right ankle, said that the coach was not the problem.,''I think he's doing the best he can do,'' said Cassell, who revealed before the game that he has a torn ligament in his ankle and will be out another 10 to 14 days. ''It ain't the coach's fault, because when a coach gives you as much freedom as Calipari does, you can't look at him.'',Showing that he does not hold grudges, Calipari played the disgruntled forward Chris Gatling for 17 minutes. In response to the trade request Gatling made before Wednesday night's loss to Portland -- a game in which the Nets also led by 14 points in the first half -- the crowd booed loudly when Gatling took his first shot, a 15-foot miss from the baseline.,But their anger subsided quickly when Gatling grabbed an offensive rebound and dunked, and the cheers rained down. The screams and claps continued as Gatling played solidly in recording 10 points and 4 rebounds. But when he left the game in the fourth quarter, the crowd booed again, leading Gatling to raise his hands in a ''bring it on'' fashion.,''That just shows the immaturity of the fans,'' Gatling said. ''We've been so supportive to them, and hey, if a guy's having a problem, don't even say anything. That's his decision. He makes it, and hey, I've got to live with it.'',The Nets were done in by the usual self-inflicted wounds. Entering as the second-worst shooting team in the league (39.2 percent), they made just 36.2 percent of their shots. Still, they led by 33-19 at one point in the second quarter and were not caught until a Dana Barros 3-pointer gave Boston its first lead since the opening minutes, at 61-60 with three minutes left in the third quarter.,The lead switched hands 10 times from that point on, until Antoine Walker (28 points, 11 rebounds, 4 steals) and Paul Pierce (21 points, 7 rebounds) grabbed the game by the throat with five minutes remaining. Walker, who was magnificent in outplaying Keith Van Horn (22 points), gave the Celtics the lead for good with a 17-footer that made it 81-80 at the 4:47 mark.,Pierce followed with a 3-pointer, then answered a Van Horn jumper with a 17-footer. The impressive rookie then fed Walker for an alley-oop dunk that Walker followed up with a 3-pointer to make it 91-82, sparking Calipari to call a timeout and the arena disk jockey to aptly spin ''The Heat Is On.''",CHRIS BROUSSARD,"FEB. 28, 1999","PRO BASKETBALL; For the Nets And Calipari, It's Another Ominous Loss",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/pro-basketball-for-the-nets-and-calipari-it-s-another-ominous-loss.html
"These are bleary, woozy and wobbly times for the Knicks, and their cram session of three games in three nights doesn't begin until Sunday afternoon.,Already, they are hurting on every level. Coach Jeff Van Gundy spent the early morning hours at Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital after becoming dehydrated because of a stomach virus that left him standing on the sideline in Boston on Friday night with alternating miseries: chills, fever, sweat . . . chills, fever, sweat.,He was in a hotel room bed today while the Knicks had a light workout -- very light considering they had played two games over the previous two nights -- to prepare for Detroit on Sunday.,If Van Gundy's state was pitiable, the appearance of Charlie Ward was worse. There was fluid dripping from his swollen, bloodshot right eye -- the result of a finger poke in Boston. Although he may have to wear goggles -- which he wore today during practice -- he said his vision is fine and he expects to play. Larry Johnson, who did not practice to ease the tendinitis in his left knee, was also expected to play. Van Gundy was expected to coach.,But what can be expected out of a fragile team that is being held together with rubber bands and paper clips? Starting off a three-game fire drill -- against Detroit, Cleveland and Miami consecutively -- with a loss on Sunday would set up the Knicks (8-4) for disaster. What better time for Allan Houston to shrug off his ghosts at the Palace and help shoulder the burden for this game?,''I think Allan would say that it's not the pressure, but deep down it is,'' said the assistant coach Don Chaney, who ran the Knicks' practice today at Oakland University. ''You want to succeed against your old team. I think he's been pressing.'',The numbers reflect a player who hasn't forgotten his days in Detroit, nor the controversial break he made when, as a free agent three years ago, Houston selected the Knicks over the Pistons. Before he shot 6 for 18 and scored 19 points in the Knicks' victory against Detroit two weeks ago, Houston had averaged an anemic 7 points a game against his old team. While his 19 points constituted a mini-breakthrough, Houston has yet to wow the jeering Detroit crowds that savor his failures.,''I still give thought to playing here,'' Houston said. ''But it's not like it was when I came back here and got booed and scored 2 points.'',If Houston can't score, it's uncertain how effective this team can be in such a state of disrepair. Actually, one of the fresher bodies against Boston was Patrick Ewing. The center with knees as worn as bald tires remains undaunted by the challenge of playing three games in three nights.,''That's the way the N.B.A. is today,'' Ewing said. ''You have to suck it up to win. You can't worry about being tired. If you have to play, you have to play.'',Until now, the Knicks have had it easy. Of their first 12 games, only five were on the road. Away from home, the Knicks have struggled. Three of their losses have been away from the cozy comfort of Madison Square Garden. And in those three defeats, the opposition has made a mockery of the Knicks' league-leading defense. Orlando, Cleveland and Boston all walked away with 90-point games and double-digit victories.,To win on Sunday, the Knicks have to cut the common threads of their three road losses. They have been out-rebounded and have averaged 19 turnovers in those losses. Second-chance points and mistakes have been their undoing. In a season as fatigue-inducing as this one, a talented Knicks team that also relies on out-working opponents to win is particularly vulnerable.,The Pistons have been suspect in their work habits, a fact that has irritated Grant Hill. After a week of bickering, finger-pointing and a five-game slide -- which included a dreadful 78-69 loss at the Garden on Feb. 15 -- the Pistons have soothed their dysfunction with four victories in their last five games.,Sharing the ball better and leaning on Joe Dumars more, the Pistons are just waiting to make amends for their sloppy effort against the Knicks. Only Hill, who scored 31 points, hit double figures for Detroit. Back then, the Knicks had a healthy glow about them. Now, that's faded. One look at Ward, Van Gundy and Johnson will tell you that.,After a 22-point effort against Minnesota on Thursday, Johnson's tendinitis flared up in Boston and left him nearly frozen on the court. He scored just 3 points and revealed how this tug-of-war with his knee could last all year. He has been healthy one day, hampered the next.,''I hope not, but it was a problem this time,'' said Johnson, who shot 1 of 5 against Boston. ''It was more when I sat down after the initial start of the game. I was loose to start out with, but once I sat down, I couldn't move anymore.,''It's especially frustrating when you lose like we did to Boston. If you win, it's all right to have a tough night. When you're losing, you really want to help your team. I've got to do what I've got to do. I've got to fight through it.'',For the bleary, woozy and wobbly, the fight has just begun.",SELENA ROBERTS,"FEB. 28, 1999",PRO BASKETBALL; There Is No Rest for Weary Knicks,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/pro-basketball-there-is-no-rest-for-weary-knicks.html
"ALL three telephones in the apartment office of Cedric Kushner, the boxing promoter, were ringing off the hook one morning last week. A crisis had arisen: One of Mr. Kushner's fighters was thinking of backing out of a bout because his mother had become convinced that demons were intent on attacking her son through air-conditioning vents. Executives at HBO, the cable network that was supposed to broadcast the match, were in a high state of anxiety.,But Mr. Kushner remained calm.,''If a boxer doesn't fight, what am I going to do? Jump out of a window?'' he asked as he coolly took another sip of Tab.''There will always be other bouts.'',Well, yes, if you are Cedric Kushner, that is. Mr. Kushner promoted 57 fights last year in the United States and Europe, a huge number by the standards of the industry. Although he doesn't represent household names like Evander Holyfield or Oscar De La Hoya, he boasts 8 world champions in his stable of 55 fighters. And few can match him for sheer tenacity. Mr. Kushner says he never turns off his cell phone because it's always business hours somewhere in the world.,''I've made some money with good talent, but mostly with volume,'' said Mr. Kushner, who is 49. ''I believe that volume will lead me to the opportunity to sign the next Evander Holyfield.'',Actually, he is setting his sights much higher than that. He wants nothing less than to restore boxing -- now a scandal-tainted sport dominated by a handful of flamboyant promoters -- to its glory days. The crux of his strategy is simple: Win over more fans. He has created a television program of boxing matches called ''Heavyweight Explosion'' that is broadcast twice a month on satellite and cable TV, including the MSG Network. He is also organizing 10 boxing shows for the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan this year.,Mr. Kushner has hired Park Avenue Productions of New York to find corporate sponsors for his bouts.,''I don't think anyone in the sports marketing and advertising business can ignore this sport anymore, especially when you look at a major conglomerate like Time Warner and the major investment that they have made in the sport,'' said Robert Crawford, Park Avenue Productions' vice president for sports and entertainment.,Mr. Kushner, a South African grocer's son,  dropped out of school in the sixth grade and came to this country at the age of 21 with no clear idea of what to do with himself. He worked as a Ferris wheel operator on the Jersey Shore and as a pool cleaner at a Miami hotel before finding a niche in rock-and-roll in the late 1970's and early 80's, promoting concerts by groups like Styx and Fleetwood Mac. He got hooked on boxing, he said, when he signed his first fighter, ''Irish'' Teddy Mann, who was actually Polish. Mr. Kushner won't say how much he is now worth, but he has offices and homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons.,Now, as co-promoter of a fight next Saturday in Atlantic City between David Reid, the only American boxer to win a gold medal in the 1996 Olympic Games, and Lou Savarese, he is nipping at the heels of the big boys. He has no illusions about his competition -- ''You'd better sharpen your teeth with barbed wire to compete with the likes of guys like Bob Arum and Don King,'' he says. But he isn't intimidated by them, either.,Right now, Mr. Arum, the president of Top Rank Boxing Inc.; Mr. King, the owner of Don King Productions, and the Duva family, the owners of Main Events, dominate an industry that is governed neither by a league nor a commission and that is only loosely regulated by state commissions. With annual revenues of just $500 million, it pales next to sports like baseball and basketball. But there are big-money events, like the planned heavyweight fight in Madison Square Garden between Mr. Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, a bout that could generate $70 million.,So far, Mr. Kushner's biggest draws are Shane Mosley, the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, and Shannon Briggs and Mr. Savarese, a pair of New York area heavyweight contenders. But he has the inside track at promoting Prince Naseem Hamed, the flamboyant featherweight from Sheffield, England, who wows crowds with his gyrating dances to the ring and his front flip over the top rope.,IN some ways, Mr. Kushner comes across as an outsider in the rough-and-tumble world of American boxing. His measured speech makes him sound almost like a diplomat. But that doesn't bother him. ''I'm involved with boxing,'' he said, ''but that doesn't mean I should be walking around with a Q-tip behind my ear, not being able to put three words together without cursing.''",TIMOTHY W.

The phones have automatic dialers programmed with the numbers of all of the company's 37 restaurants in the United States and 62 overseas, plus the home phone numbers of his top executives.,The allergies are tougher; he doesn't like prescription drugs and takes only Tylenol when they kick up. I don't fit the rock-and-roll drug thing, he said. His personal pharmacy also includes vitamin pills and melatonin, to help him sleep -- though he says it doesn't do much for him.,The book he packs these days is Insights on Leadership, edited by Larry C. Spears (John Wiley & Sons, 1997), which is required reading in the Rock 202 course taken by standout Hard Rock employees after they graduate from Rock 101. Also in the bag is a card outlining the company's seven core values, including love all -- serve all and save the planet. Then there are the golden Elvis pins, awarded to employees for exemplary work and prized by collectors, who pay up to $800 for them.,ROY FURCHGOTT",ROY FURCHGOTT,"FEB. 28, 1999",PRIVATE SECTOR; IN MY...

"Wall Street traders who see the Bloomberg name on the company's desktop boxes all week may soon start seeing it on weekends, too -- if they are art lovers. Michael Bloomberg, who has built a fortune in the data services business, pledged an estimated $5 million to underwrite the new generation of audio guides for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The guides, which will carry the phrase, ''sponsored by Bloomberg News,'' will make their debut in April for the opening of the the newly renovated Greek galleries. Over the remainder of the year, the guides, which will provide multilingual tours and use CD's rather than tapes, will be introduced throughout the museum.,Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Met, said that putting the Bloomberg name on the guides would remind visitors that the highest technology was being used.,Not everyone sees things that way, of course. ''I am amazed at the extent to which commercial promotions have intruded themselves into everyday life,'' said Morris Dickstein, director of the Center for the Humanities at the Graduate School of the City University of New York. ''T-shirts and sports arenas are one thing. But we tend to think of culture as something sacrosanct. Obviously, this is no longer the case.'',Mr. Holzer disagreed. ''We are talking about a very generous grant that does not intrude on the museum's integrity,'' he said. The Bloomberg name, he added, ''will appear on audio guides and not atop paintings or the door of the museum.''

"Perhaps this was the one step backward that comes after two steps forward. Last Sunday, El Pais, Spain's biggest and most influential newspaper, pronounced Ana Patricia Botin ''the most powerful woman in Spain.'' And why not? Ms. Botin, 38, was widely viewed as the heir apparent to her father, Emilio Botin, the chairman of Spain's largest bank, Banco Santander. Mr. Botin had long been grooming his daughter for big things in the machismo world of Spanish banking. A Bryn Mawr economics graduate who worked at J. P. Morgan in New York and Spain in the 1980's, Ms. Botin was put in charge of spurring Santander's big investment in Latin America.,The day after the El Pais article, however, she resigned abruptly as Santander's executive vice president. Some analysts said the newspaper profile fueled jealousy at Spain's Banco Central Hispano, which agreed last month to be acquired by Santander for $11.3 billion in stock.

"A FEW big new developments make this a good time to look again at some of the loyalty programs in the world of travel. Perhaps I should have looked sooner; the report on my United Mileage Plus program for December noted that 4,842 miles had expired with the old year. People who scatter their travel among airlines and hotels based on convenience and price often suffer these setbacks. But some new programs involve miles or points that are evergreen or permit earning miles for one line while flying another. These may get us bits-and-pieces people back into the game.,Hotel Entry,A major new frequent guest program was announced by Starwood Hotels and Resorts. If Starwood is not a household word, this is because it is a real estate investment trust, with headquarters in White Plains and with no hotel bearing its own name. It owns Sheraton and Westin and other midpriced and upscale hotels and resorts: Four Points, Caesars and W hotels, as well as the Luxury Collection, which includes the St. Regis brand. Starwood is now promoting, reshuffling and renaming many of the 650 hotels it has recently acquired.,Barry Sternlicht, chairman of Starwood, said the Preferred Guest program was designed to be easy to understand. Points are awarded for all money spent in participating properties -- 550 of the 650. (The program excludes some properties the trust has taken over bearing other brand names -- Marriott, for example -- that have competing programs.),New members get two points for every dollar spent. After 10 stays in a year, the member gets three points for every dollar. And it goes up from there.,Points do not expire with age if the member stays in a participating hotel once a year. There are no blackout dates and no capacity controls,  Mr. Sternlicht said: a hotel will give its last available room to someone using points.,The Starwood program is not for budget travelers. Hoyt H. Harper, the company's vice president for marketing programs, said that a weekend hotel night at the ''mid scale'' Four Points in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., would require 2,000 points; during the week, 3,000. On the high end, the Princeville Hotel on Kauai, Hawaii, would cost 10,000 points a night, weekday or weekend.,The program has links to 21 airlines. Points transfer at one point to one mile on Air France, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, Alitalia, American, America West, Ansett Australia, Asiana, Canadian, Cathay Pacific, Continental, Delta, Eva Air, Japan Airlines, K.L.M., Northwest, Qantas, Saudi Arabian, Thai Airways, United and US Airways.,Those who reserve at any hotel in the program can ask to sign up when the reservation is made. Information is also available on the Web site: www.preferredguest.com.,Airlines' Link,On Feb. 1, five airlines linked their marketing programs: American, British Airways, Canadian, Cathay Pacific and Qantas Airways. Travelers flying on most flights on any of these airlines can earn points through the program, called One World, on any other line, and can also redeem points interchangeably.,Because of variations in names for elite levels of the lines' programs, One World is establishing its own categories, emerald, sapphire and ruby, which will be indicated on the cards. This will enable employees to know what privileges a member of another line's plan is entitled to. The cards will be jointly marked for the particular airline program and One World.,There is one catch: direct trans-Atlantic flights on British Airways and American Airlines are not interchangeable for accruing points or spending them. These two lines have been pressing regulators for a separate, closer alliance; meantime, a spokesman said, they are prevented by Government rules from exchanging mileage across the Atlantic.,The pooling of frequent flier awards was pioneered by the Star Alliance, set up in 1997 by United, Lufthansa, Air Canada, Scandinavian and Thai Airways.,The individual airlines maintain their separate rules on mileage expiration and the like.,Other two-way alliances have been set up, with varying rules. Northwest and Continental linked their programs last year, and as of March 1, miles from one line may be used to get a ticket on the other, although they cannot be pooled. Meantime, both airlines have turned back the clock a little, offering round-trip domestic tickets for 20,000 miles in the low season, September to May, instead of the 25,000 miles needed in summer.,US Airways, in January, also set up a 20,000-mile award for travel within the United States and Canada in the low season, in this case between Sept. 15 and the end of February. The line added two hitches at the same time: Saturday-night stays will be required for domestic or Canadian trips on reservations made after March 31 and on trips after Sept. 15. Starting in January 2000, the Dividend Miles will expire within three calendar years if the member does not fly on US Airways in that period. Miles earned before then will not expire.,Will the increase in alliances and the lowering of some mileage levels make the pressure for reward seats worse than it already is? Randy Petersen, editor of the magazine Inside Flyer, says redemptions were up 20 percent last year, the biggest increase on record: Nothing above a 9 percent rise had been seen before, he said.,Mr. Petersen said the growth was probably related more to the booming economy than to increasing friendliness on the part of the airlines. In 1999, he sees a moderate rise in difficulty in getting certain award trips.,''For some trips, there will never be enough seats,'' he said. ''Tel Aviv is the toughest of all. Call at two minutes past midnight a year in advance, and the seats went to people who called at one minute past.'',From American Express,The American Express Membership Rewards program, formerly Membership Miles, added some new partners this month, mostly stores. Points may be exchanged for purchases or gift certificates at Borders Books, Avis Rent a Car, Cathay Pacific Airways, Samsonite stores, the Sharper Image and Foot Locker, among others.,The airlines where American Express Membership Rewards points may be used to obtain tickets, or to ''top off'' a balance too small for a ticket or an upgrade, are Delta, US Airways, Continental, Southwest, T.W.A., Hawaiian, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, Aeromexico, El Al, Sabena and Mexicana.,The core of Membership Rewards is the double dip: If you charge an airline ticket on the American Express card, you get the reward points and also the miles when you fly the trip. These points do not expire, but the downside comes if you fail to pay your American Express bill on time:  your Membership Rewards points are docked for that month. However, a phone call to (800) 297-3276 and a payment of $15 will restore a month's lost points.",BETSY WADE,"FEB. 28, 1999",PRACTICAL TRAVELER; Fliers' Awards: Some New Math,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/travel/practical-traveler-fliers-awards-some-new-math.html
"About 15 years ago, a group of Persian Sephardic Jews who had left Iran and settled in New York started a small congregation that used the facilities of the Park East Synagogue on East 67th Street.,Over the years, the congregation, which describes itself as ''modern Orthodox,'' has grown to about 200 members. ''We decided it was time we had a synagogue of our own,'' said Kayvan Hakim, a developer, manager and owner of real estate in New York and California. And so demolition will begin in April on a vacant building at 128-130 East 58th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues. And construction is scheduled to begin this summer on a $12 million, 13-story building that is to be a synagogue and much more for what is to be known as the Park Avenue Sephardic Congregation.,The building, designed by Marvin H. Meltzer of Meltzer/Mandl Architects in Manhattan, is to have a two-story main sanctuary for 400 worshipers; a smaller mezzanine chapel seating 50 for weekday morning and afternoon services; a 3,000-square-foot banquet room with kitchen facilities; conference rooms; a gymnasium, and a swimming pool.,Seven floors of the building are planned for a co-ed high school for an as-yet-undetermined number of students. ''We are talking to several schools to see if they can run the program for us,'' said David Eshaghian, a member of the congregation's steering committee who is a real estate owner, manager and developer in Manhattan. ''It will be a Jewish high school for students with all kinds of backgrounds and all kinds of knowledge of Judaism, with both secular and religious education.'',Mr. Hakim said that the synagogue's goal would be to bring ''Sephardic Jews from all backgrounds, Persian, Turkish, Syrian, Moroccan and others, under one roof -- but we will also encourage membership from the city's large Ashkenazic community; we want to remove barriers, not put them up.'',A fund-raising campaign is continuing. ''We need more pledges to get started,'' he said.,From 1981 to early 1987, the 58th Street site was home to the Roman Catholic Chapel of Saints Faith, Hope and Charity. Before that it was the Fine Arts Theater, a movie house. Mr. Hakim said that he and his family bought the building from the Archdiocese of New York two years ago for ''less than $2 million'' and are donating it to the congregation.,Mr. Meltzer, the architect, said that he wanted to give the building the identity of a Jewish religious institution, ''in a powerful but subtle way.'',''That's where the idea of a glass wall with a subtle design of a Jewish star as the most significant part came from,'' he said. ''It's a tall, thin building, and the Jewish star is up high because 58th Street is heavily trafficked, with trucks always parked there. It will be lit from the inside so people will be aware of it at night.'',Mr. Meltzer has synagogue experience. ''I grew up in St. Paul, where my father was an Orthodox rabbi,'' he said, ''and for my college thesis I designed a synagogue for him. It was never built, but it put me on the road to being an architect.'',MERVYN ROTHSTEIN",,"FEB. 28, 1999",POSTINGS: Sephardic Congregation Plans a New Home; A Synagogue for East 58th St.,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/postings-sephardic-congregation-plans-a-new-home-a-synagogue-for-east-58th-st.html

"LAST summer, when the Japanese yen plunged to more than 140 to the dollar, investors were worried that the weak yen would force the Chinese to devalue their currency, the yuan. And that, analysts said at the time, would send the Asian economies into yet another downward spiral.,Well, China did not devalue. The yen did an about-face, rising 29 percent in two months. And when Brazil devalued its currency in January, China moved to quash any new investor tremors by reassuring the world, again, that it would not follow suit.,But this does not mean that investors can take China off their early-warning screen. In fact, there may be more reasons to be worried about China -- and its potential impact on global financial markets -- now than there were last summer.,The news from China is not positive at all, even if it is not making waves. The economy is slowing, analysts say, pointing to indicators like slow growth in electricity consumption, falling exports and declining growth in retail sales. Analysts don't believe China's report that its economy grew 7.8 percent last year. ''That is not even close,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China economic specialist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.,At the same time, foreign investment in the form of loans, bonds and stock sales seems to be declining, with much of the decrease following the closing in October of a big nonbank financial institution, the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation, or Gitic. It has since formally gone bankrupt, and other trust and investment companies have also rolled over. More failures are expected.,The way China handled the collapse of Gitic ''is going to have long-term consequences,'' Mr. Lardy said, adding that ''the environment has never been worse for China in the raising of capital in foreign markets.'' He thinks foreign bank loans are down sharply from their $59 billion total in June 1998, the most recent data from the Bank for International Settlements.,The last few attempts at public stock offerings, including that of Shandong International Power Development, have been withdrawn. David Lee, the analyst for Asia at Fiduciary Trust International, a New York-based global fund manager and longtime investor in Hong Kong and China, said underwriters had invited him to a road show on Shandong, but he didn't bother to attend. ''It wasn't worth our time to look into that deal,'' he said.,The bad news has not been enough to set investors trembling again. But the recent fall in the Japanese yen may reawaken concerns, even if the decline is not likely to be the catalyst for a devaluation.,Since its January high, the yen has dropped 9 percent, to 119 to the dollar. That is not the 140 of last summer. But the yen could return to that neighborhood if the Japanese take the steps that American officials are urging to stimulate their economy.,''If you get the yen weakening, China is going to come back into the picture,'' said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.,A weaker yen would make Chinese exports less competitive with those of Japan. But today, analysts do not think that such a competitive disadvantage would be painful enough to prompt a Chinese devaluation.,Instead, they think the catalyst would be a deterioration in China's balance of payments. Mr. Lardy argues that this deterioration could already be under way because of the loss of foreign credit and the slowdown in the Chinese economy. There are no data to prove that -- yet.,''I think they're going to be looking at devaluation much sooner than you'd expect, if there is a significant reduction in their ability to borrow from banks or to sell debt internationally,'' Mr. Lardy told a group of money managers recently.,It it worth noting that the governor of China's central bank, Dai Xianglong, did not rule out a currency devaluation when he sought to reassure the world and investors in January. The yuan, he said, will be devalued only ''when there is a great imbalance in the balance of payments of China and there is a great increase in the cost of exports.'',''But I do not think these conditions exist this year,'' he continued.,We'll see.",JONATHAN FUERBRINGER,"FEB. 28, 1999","PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; Complacency About China Is Misplaced",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/portfolios-etc-complacency-about-china-is-misplaced.html
"LAST year, when the Cajun band Beausoleil won a Grammy Award for best traditional folk album, it was another unexpected reward for a Cajun band just doing what it loves to do.,To hear Michael Doucet, Beausoleil's founder and lead singer, tell it, the band, coming to the Community Theater in Morristown on Thursday, was formed in 1975 with aspirations that didn't go beyond its home state of Louisiana. The plan was to perform in clubs and keep alive a piece of culture that didn't seem to be held in high esteem locally, much less nationally. Then, Mr. Doucet recalls, with what still sounds like surprise and befuddlement, something happened.,He believes it all began with the Cajun cooking craze of the 1980's. When chefs like Paul Prudhomme and Justin Wilson poured on the hot sauce, it drew mainstream attention to other elements of Louisiana culture. The music Mr. Doucet had cherished as a teen-ager, and whose origins he had once obtained grants to study as a folklorist, suddenly caught fire.,In 1986, he left his job as an instructor of French music -- everything from opera to zydeco -- at the University of Southwest Louisiana and went where the music took him. In another turning point, Beausoleil was invited to appear on ''The Prairie Home Companion'' on public radio. Being introduced to the nation by Garrison Keillor ''made us a lot less scary,'' Mr. Doucet said.,Through the band's whole rise to their current status as international ambassadors of Cajun music, he never once solicited a gig, he said; it was just a matter of accepting invitations. The band didn't have an agent until the 1990's.,Beausoleil performs what is essentially traditional fiddle- and accordion-oriented Cajun music with a contemporary, lively feel. That's why it has been able to collaborate with musicians from outside the genre, like Richard Thompson or Mary Chapin Carpenter. The band's new album, ''Cajunization,'' due out March 16 on Rhino Records, at times drops doses of blues, surf, Cuban and Hawaiian music into its bayou brew.,Mr. Doucet, who spoke in an easygoing, unmeditated way in a telephone interview from his home outside Lafayette, La., said he was not afraid to be influenced by other genres. Good music isn't just about a tradition, he says, but what a performer can bring to it. Even though he has studied the masters, he believes that to succeed, he just has to write what he feels. ''Of course, when you put your music next to a song that's been around 200 years, it better be good,'' he said.,Beausoleil releases well-regarded studio albums at a prolific rate (the group had been nominated for seven Grammys before winning last year), but it is really a band that needs to be seen live. (Ms. Carpenter wrote the song ''Down at the Twist and Shout'' about Beausoleil.) In all the years of playing festivals, auditoriums and old vaudeville houses, there was rarely an audience that Beausoleil couldn't get moving, Mr. Doucet said. Asked to name one, he remembered a show in Manhattan, Kan., where the performance was part of a subscription series.,''Almost all Beausoleil's lyrics are in French, and even the rare English song will have some French verse to it,'' he said. The typical audience will have ''a few Francophiles,'' but usually people are mostly English-speakers who are content to live by the dictum that music is a universal language. Mr. Doucet recalls a man who came up to him said he enjoyed Beausoleil the same way he appreciated opera: understanding what each word meant was not entirely essential. Mr. Doucet sometimes receives requests to sing more in English, but ''that's not why we're here,'' he said.,When he's not playing, Mr. Doucet has plans for writing a book about the great masters of the genre. The former teacher and folklore student still goes to high schools and colleges to talk about Cajun music. ''You have to perpetuate the music,'' he said, ''so it doesn't get filed away as some folklore thesis.'',BEAUSOLEIL,Community Theater,100 South Street, Morristown,Thursday at 7:30 P.M.,(973) 539-8008",BILL SYKEN,"FEB. 28, 1999","POP MUSIC; Folklore, Living, Breathing and Singing",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/pop-music-folklore-living-breathing-and-singing.html
"Re-election Pledges Complicate Strategies,One of the main reasons Democrats are so optimistic about retaking control of the House of Representatives next year is that nine Republicans, but only one Democrat, pledged in the 1998 campaign not to seek re-election in 2000.,But taking the pledge to surrender power and suppress ego is one thing. Sticking by it is another.,At least three of the Republicans -- Scott McInnis of Colorado, Tillie Fowler of Florida and George Nethercutt of Washington -- are having second thoughts, to the chagrin of Democratic leaders. But to the delight of those leaders, the sole Democrat who took the pledge, Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts, is also having second thoughts.,So Democrats still see a special opportunity to narrow, if not overcome, the current 10-seat edge that Republicans have in the House. They figure that, at a minimum, six Republican-held seats will be open next year because the incumbents chose to limit their stays on Capitol Hill -- and open seats are the easiest to contest.,Enter U.S. Term Limits, one of the leading groups pushing for mandatory limits on service in Congress. It is demanding that the three wavering Republicans, as well as the single Democrat, stick by their pledges, and it says it will spend more than $20 million between now and next election day to keep their feet to the fire and to promote its cause.,Over the last few weeks, to increase pressure, on the waverers, the group, based in Washington, has commissioned polls in several districts that indicate voters strongly embrace term limits and want legislators who pledge to limit their service to stick with their pledges -- or risk losing votes.,The group's executive director, Paul Jacob, warned in releasing the poll results: ''Representatives might be able to survive a broken term-limits pledge in their own districts, where they have all the advantages of incumbency, but it will devastate any hopes they have for statewide office in the future.'',In Mr. Nethercutt's district, U.S. Term Limits has gone a step further, buying space on a big red, white and blue billboard in Spokane and offering ''thanks'' in advance to Mr. Nethercutt for ''keeping your word.'',''We think we owe it to George to take him at his word,'' Mr. Jacob said, calling the billboard a pressure ploy, not an embarrassing misreading of where Mr. Nethercutt stands, or does not stand, on term limits.,Mr. Nethercutt countered: ''I assume they mean my promise to cut taxes, balance the budget and end the welfare system as we knew it. That's what I promised, too.'',What if Politicians Could Tell No Lies,Last year's elections in Georgia were notably negative and mean-spirited, with candidates for governor and lieutenant governor repeatedly accusing their opponents of lies and distortions. In fact, when Lieut. Gov. Mark Taylor's opponent, Mitch Skandalakis, broadcast an ad that raised the issue of whether Mr. Taylor had ever been hospitalized for drug abuse, Mr. Taylor filed a slander suit.,The suit is pending -- and so is a new bill in the Georgia House of Representatives that would make it a violation of the state's ethics laws for a candidate to lie while on the campaign trail.,The bill's leading sponsor, Representative Jeanette Jamieson of Toccoa, in northeast Georgia, acknowledges that Mr. Dooley got it right, that politics ain't beanbag. But she contends that things have gotten totally out of hand recently in Georgia and the rest of the nation when it comes to public figures and would-be public figures stretching the truth.,''If you have to tell the truth about the fat content in a hamburger,'' she argued the other day, ''why shouldn't you have to tell the truth about another individual who is offering for public office?'',The legislative prospects for her bill are unclear at this point.,Some other state's that have tried to legislate political morality over the years have, however well-meaning their intent, run into freedom-of-speech problems. Last year, for example, the Washington State Supreme Court struck down a law that banned false political advertising, finding that it infringed on free speech.,The Georgia bill is relatively benign in that it has no provision that candidates who lie could be fined or jailed. Rather, the bill would let the Georgia Ethics Commission, the enforcer of the state's election laws, hold hearings when accusations of lying are made, with the prospect that a finding of wrongdoing would embarrass the violator as a prevaricator.,But even that provision worries some legislative leaders, who suggest that maybe those old political standbys, true facts and voter anger, remain the best solution to campaign lying, not still another law, especially one that tries to govern what comes out of a politician's mouth in the heat of a campaign.,''It's a thin line on freedom of speech,'' Representative Calvin Smyre of Columbus, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said last week when asked about the Jamieson bill's legislative prospects.,Detroit Mayor Archer Faces Recall Petitions,On Nov. 4, 1997, Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit swept to re-election to a second term with 84 percent of the vote. But before the year was out, anti-Archer grumbling could be heard, and today, just over a year later, teams of Archer critics are out on the street circulating petitions for a recall vote.,They need 57,000 signatures. So far they have about 25,000, and they confidently predict they will get the rest by mid-April so that a special election can be held this summer.,''He needs to go,'' Ernest Johnson, one anti-Archerite, said recently.,Why?,The leaflets being passed out by the people gathering signatures, most of whom are members of two city community organizations, Black Slate Inc. and the Community Coalition, complain that the Mayor, a Democrat, has ignored the needs of Detroit's schools, allowed its neighborhoods to deteriorate and failed to provide adequate city services, most especially snow removal when a recent blizzard crippled the town. The city normally does not plow residential streets and has just 59 snowplows. But the Mayor delayed contracting for 17 snowplows from the suburbs, which then recalled their plows when it began snowing again.,But worst of all, say the Mayor's critics, he deeply angered the city's blacks, who make up 75 percent of the total population, by passing over the only black bidder when it came time to award lucrative casino licenses. In so doing, many of the anti-Archerites contend, the Mayor, who is black, created a perception that he is too close to the city's white business establishment.,The Mayor says he has always run the city on principle, not by favoring one group or interest over another. And he says he will continue to run it that way.,Will the recall work?,With dozens of people out on the street gathering signatures, the anti-Archerites very well might get the election they seek.

"HAVE the holidays left a dog on your doorstep, or a kitten on your couch? Although winter may not be the ideal season for training a new pet, some things in life are not optional.,For new owners of puppies, the first order is housebreaking. Stinging winds, layered clothing and icy walkways are obstacles to the hourly walk routine.,The goal is quick association to a particular spot and then immediate elimination.,Although structure and routine are still the order, there are a few hints that may expedite the process. Each time your dog wakes from a nap, finishes a meal or water, breaks from play or is removed from isolation, it is up to you to encourage a housebreaking trip.,*Resist morning greetings until your dog's housebreaking trip is successful.,*Articulate your intentions. Choose one route that leads you to a housebreaking area, inside or out, saying, ''outside'' or ''papers'' as you lead. If the area chosen is outside, then pick one close to the door. In the spring, this area can be switched to a more private one.,*Put bells at your dog's chest level along the pathway, tapping them as you proceed, repeating ''outside'' as they ring.,*Articulate a housebreaking order, like ''Get busy,'' as your dog eliminates.,*Be cheerful and consistent, cleaning all accidents in private, using a spray bottle with a vinegar-water solution or Nature's Miracle to alleviate the smell. A public clean-up congratulates a puppy's performance.,Another challenge in winter is coping with a dog's energy level. Because meandering walks will have to wait for spring, games like two-ball toss and soda-bottle soccer are cheerful ways to keep your puppy from attacking your slippers.,*Two-Ball Toss: Toss one toy for your puppy. Be sure to cheer as your pet chases it down, but when it is brought to you, do not reach for it. Puppies see this as confrontational play; attracting their interest with your toy will shadow you with importance. Have your dog sit before the toy is tossed.,*Soda-Bottle Soccer: Take a few empty soda bottles, removing labels and caps, and kick them about on the floor. Avoid kicking the one keeping the dog busy.,*Always show interest in what the dog does not have; in turn, this will draw your pet's attention to you.,Other Cautions,Winter salt. Salt used to make it safer to get around is harmful to your pet's system. To avoid ingestion of salt by your pet, use a dipping bowl or bucket and towels to rub the salt off paws after a walk.,Ice cuts. Another common winter hazard is the ice, which can slice a dog's paws, leaving them bleeding and lame. Immediate veterinarian attention is mandatory.,Flexible leads. Avoid using such leash systems in trafficked areas. The system is hard to control -- especially with gloved hands -- and slippery walkways decrease your stability.,Cats in the Cold,Although many cats can regulate their temperature, winter is not the time to let them outside. Their agile capacities, which are used to escape neighborhood predators, are diminished by ice and snow, leaving them confused and defenseless.,This is not to say that cats will hibernate through the winter months. Still active and curious, cats, both young and old, need stimulation year round.,Amusement for these natural predators of rodents comes best in the form of small moving objects. Cat toys cater to this interest, though even a moving pencil from under a door will do. Stringed feathers or yarn are also preoccupations, although ingestible toys should be stored when there is no supervision.,And lest one forgets one of the most satisfying joys of winter, remember what it is like to have a sleeping cat on the lap and a steaming beverage in hand while both owner and pet dream of the assurances of spring.",SARAH HODGSON,"FEB. 28, 1999",PETS; Structure and Routine Guide Housebreaking,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/pets-structure-and-routine-guide-housebreaking.html
"THIS is a story about two bankrupt entrepreneurs and the tiny car that brought them back from the edge of ruin after they rescued it from obscurity. A hocked gold Rolex watch, an angel, a garage full of mothballed machinery and a Czech arms factory also play important roles.,From these, Steven J. Singer and Justus Bauschinger fashioned the Lilliput Motor Company in 1990. Lilliput, a small catalogue business specializing in nostalgic metal toys, grew steadily until it made $1 million in sales in 1996. Then the partners sold it to Genesis Direct, a New Jersey catalogue consolidator.,But now Genesis Direct has decided to reposition its business, and the founders of Lilliput are buying it back.,Their story illustrates some of the great entrepreneurial themes: the power of persistence, the value of a good idea and sheer luck, and the perils of growing too fast. It also shows that even entrepreneurs who have failed time and again can finally succeed if they find the right niche.,The partners are vivid contrasts. Mr. Bauschinger, 54, may sometimes be gruff-voiced and outspoken. The title on his business card is ''autodidact.'' He is responsible for product scouting, international negotiations, catalogue design and copy writing. Mr. Singer, 48, is friendly, fast-talking and eager to please. His card says ''chief mechanic,'' and he handles the finances.,Ten years ago, Mr. Bauschinger and Mr. Singer were partners in an upscale toy store called Kinder Zimmer, German for ''children's room,'' in San Francisco. The store went broke in 1989, dragging both men into personal bankruptcy. They had also experienced a business failure when their outdoor clothing company, Class 5, folded in the 1970's. But they had one more idea.,Mr. Bauschinger had noticed that men in suits would occasionally wander into their store and gladly pay $50 or more for the small die-cast metal cars made by Schuco, a German toy manufacturer.,In 1990, the partners incorporated as the Lilliput Motor Company. They ordered 100 Schuco Volkswagen Beetles, not much larger than the insects themselves, and began a modest newspaper advertising campaign on the West Coast. The shipment sold out.,But when they were ready to place another order, there were no more Bugs to buy. Schuco had gone bankrupt. Its equipment was in the garage of a former company engineer in Germany. And he was dead.,So Mr. Bauschinger hocked the Rolex for $6,000 to pay another former Schuco engineer to compile an equipment inventory. That's when the angel, Jared Dreyfus, a venture capitalist in the San Francisco Bay area, saw a Schuco car, recognized the toy from his own childhood and agreed to invest $75,000 so Lilliput could make more cars.,LATER that year, Schuco's 22 tons of equipment were moved into a recently idled arms factory in what was then Czechoslovakia. Tiny toy cars -- miniatures of Volkswagens and other models -- soon rolled off an assembly line where the product had been tanks.,The die-cast toys, with wind-up motors and rubber tires, can zoom across smooth floors at up to 35 miles an hour. They were known as ''pocket rockets'' to boys who grew up during the baby boom, when around three million of the toys were sold in the United States.,Lilliput mailed out fliers, sold hundreds of the cars and was on the road to success. Today, its offerings range from a $25, two-inch model of a VW bug to a $2,500 metal model airplane with a 22-inch wingspan and a key-wind motor that powers three propellers. Lilliput also sells mechanical clocks, trains, boats and model steam engines.,By tapping into a growing market of baby boomers looking longingly back at childhood, Lilliput grew slowly but steadily. The founders earned as much as $60,000 each in annual salary. But the company still made only a 5 percent after-tax profit. And Lilliput couldn't get loans to expand because of the owners' earlier bankruptcies.,Then Mr. Singer learned about Genesis Direct, which was buying up small catalogue companies. In late 1996, it bought Lilliput for just over $1 million, leaving the founders in charge and giving them money to expand. Sales grew to $5 million last year, although profits were still only marginal.,Genesis Direct as a whole grew much more quickly, but not always smoothly. It lost almost $60 million between last May, when it went public, and the end of 1998. In January, the company said it would shut down or sell most of its 30 catalogues and concentrate on marketing sports-inspired merchandise on line as Proteam.com.,Mr. Singer and Mr. Bauschinger offered to buy back Lilliput for about what they received for it two years ago, although it has grown fivefold. The offer was accepted last week, and Mr. Singer expects the purchase to be complete this week.,The conventional catalogue strategy is to lose money for a few years while doing huge mailings to build a customer list. But now Mr. Singer expects a return to Lilliput's earlier strategy, when past bankruptcies ruled out borrowing. ''We had to make money every year,'' he said. ''We had no choice but to go slowly.''",JON CHRISTENSEN,"FEB. 28, 1999",PERSONAL BUSINESS; Growing From a Tiny Wheelbase,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/personal-business-growing-from-a-tiny-wheelbase.html
"It's no secret that even in a robust economy, downsizing has become a permanent fixture. But in a study of layoffs over the last six years, Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm in Chicago, has found that the computer industry, considered a prime source of job growth, is also a leader in job loss.,The firm said that from 1993 through 1998, companies in more than 30 industries announced a combined 3.1 million layoffs; seven industries accounted for more than half the total. The computer industry ranked third in downsizing, outpointed only by aerospace and retailing.,Computers, it seems, are the job market's Shiva, the Indian deity that is both creator and destroyer. ''While it is true that this sector has consistently been one of the biggest job generators, it is also one of the most volatile,'' John Challenger, the firm's chief executive, said. ''If you are looking for a career that offers the most job security, the computer industry may not assure that.''   DANIEL M. GOLD",DANIEL M.

"THE Clinton Administration wants to issue new standards to protect workers against the sprains, strains, aches and pains caused by repetitive motions of all types, from punching a computer keyboard to ripping the guts from carcasses in a beef slaughterhouse.,But the rules will not take effect until late next year at the earliest. So what should workers do in the meantime if they have aching backs, crippled fingers, sore wrists or other problems caused by activities on the job?,Labor union officials and management lawyers agree on the answers, up to a point. They also agree that just by publicizing the risks of occupational injuries known as musculoskeletal disorders, the Labor Department has strengthened the hand of employees, making it harder for employers to deny the hazards.,''The fact of a proposed regulation spawns a new level of interest and activity long before the regulation has the force of law,'' said Jeffrey S. Klein, a New York lawyer who advises companies. ''It will encourage employers to look into this issue and find out what they should be doing.'',Mr. Klein said employees should report workplace injuries and ailments to their supervisors or to their human resources departments. ''The company becomes aware of a problem only if people communicate about it,'' said Mr. Klein, a member of the labor relations committee of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''Specifics are critical to an employer's ability to analyze and respond to the problem.'',Margaret M. Seminario, director of occupational safety and health for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., agreed that employees should generally report their symptoms.,But caution may be required, she said. ''There may be a cost to pay for bringing these problems to the employer's attention,'' Ms. Seminario said. ''The employer may retaliate against the employee.'',Employers display about as wide a range of responses to ergonomic issues today as they did to complaints of sexual harassment 15 years ago. Many employers tend to minimize workers' complaints, finding the symptoms vague and the evidence of causes murky. But other companies have worked closely with employees to redesign jobs and reduce injuries and disability costs.,In effect, the Labor Department would require thousands of companies to duplicate the practices developed by employers like Perdue Farms and Fieldcrest Cannon, the textile manufacturer.,Jackie Nowell, director of occupational safety and health for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union,  offers different advice to workers depending on whether they belong to a union. ''If you're in a union shop, go to your supervisor, get medical care in or outside the plant,'' she said. ''Talk to the shop steward. But in a nonunion plant, you can sometimes be fired for telling a supervisor that you're hurt.'',Federal law prohibits employers from dismissing workers because they file commplaints about conditions that might cause injuries, but Labor Department officials acknowledge it is often difficult for workers to take advantage of protections.,Eric Frumin, health and safety director at the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said ''In most states, it's not against the law to fire or discipline workers simply because they've reported an injury.'' Therefore, he said, workers should ask a question before speaking up: ''What happened to the last people who reported an injury in your workplace?'',Mr. Frumin said workers with occupational injuries need to ''plan a strategy'' and should consider taking these steps:,* Report the injury to your employer.,* Make sure the employer records it in the log of injuries and illnesses required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers have a right to inspect the log; employers must post it each February.,* Request an evaluation of your job and work station or equipment to identify hazards that may have contributed to your  disorder. It may be useful to have other employees take part.,* Ask the employer to correct any hazards found. The injured employee or others with similar problems should take part in efforts to redesign the job or work station.,* If you go to a doctor, make sure he knows the problem may be work-related. It may help to provide him with photographs or a video showing the nature of your work.,Congress has blocked the Labor Department from issuing ergonomics standards, but the restriction has expired. The United States Chamber of Commerce says the new proposal would tighten what it calls the ''regulatory chokehold'' on employers.,Joseph A. Dear, the Assistant Secretary of Labor in charge of OSHA from late 1993 to early 1997, said employer groups had opposed ergonomics standards more strenuously than many other OSHA rules. ''They see ergonomics standards as threatening management's ability to control the production process,'' Mr. Dear said. ''They fear that the Government will make them slow down the production line.'',In fact, Mr. Dear and his successor, Charles N. Jeffress, said companies that redesign jobs to address workers' concerns often find that injury rates decline while productivity and employee morale increase.

"Driving south on utah's highway 59, you slip out of the subdivisions sprouting in the desert, ascend to a lonely stretch of ink-colored juniper trees, then suddenly find yourself at the edge of the last century. There on the Arizona border, tucked behind towering flanks of red rock, is a town of about 5,000 people. Most are Mormon fundamentalists, and most are outlaws: it is the largest polygamous community in the United States.,Though polygamy is a felony, nobody has to hide from the law in this town, called Hildale on the Utah side of the state line, Colorado City on the other. More than a century after it was outlawed, polygamy is flourishing in Utah and small pockets of the American West, nurtured by religious directives and the hands-off stance of legal authorities.,Laura Chapman, 36, is the 25th child from a family with four mothers and 31 children, and she knows most of the people in Hildale and Colorado City, even the few she is not related to by blood. Chapman left the town years ago -- she calls it ''the land that time forgot.'' Today she is one of a new group of women who have fled plural families and want to draw attention to the reality of modern polygamy.,Forget the sepia-toned notion of kindly Mormon patriarchs frolicking with a bushel of happy wives, these women say. Forget about the polygamy of Abraham or the Mormon pioneer Brigham Young. Late-20th-century polygamy, practiced by people who seem unconcerned about the law or public opinion, is a Dark Ages hybrid, say women who have left the big families. They raise allegations of sexual abuse, pedophilia and incest. ''This is organized crime, operating under the cover of religion,'' Chapman maintains.,If the charges of women like Chapman have been shrugged off before, that may be about to change. Last year a teen-age girl emerged with a story of incest, child abuse and forced marriage at the hands of one of Utah's biggest polygamous clans, the Kingstons -- who are based right in Salt Lake City, within a few miles of the domed capital building. Whatever the outcome, Chapman and other ex-wives of polygamy hope the resulting trials, scheduled to begin in April, will force a reckoning with Utah's oldest ghost.,There are two worlds in the beehive state. One is the Utah of first impressions, from the powder snow in the mountains to the brisk, overtly friendly business climate. The other Utah is harder to know. Mark Twain called it ''a land of enchantment and awful mystery.'' Even now one side of the state's personality remains hidden.,After the Mormon Church denounced polygamy and Utah outlawed it in 1896 -- Washington had made this a condition of statehood -- it was thought that the practice of taking multiple wives would ultimately disappear. But a century later the opposite has happened, with anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 people living in families where one man is married to 2, 3, 5, as many as 30 women. No one has been prosecuted for polygamy in Utah for nearly 50 years, and the state's power structure has not made enforcement an issue. Last year Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who is himself a descendant of polygamists, even said the practice is not often prosecuted in part because ''these people have religious freedoms'' (a statement he later amended in the wake of a public outcry).,The practice is still a minority one in this state of two million people, of course, and the mainstream Mormon leadership in Salt Lake City strongly condemns it. But it survives in ''clans'' -- massive patriarchal cabals linked by bloodlines and business ties, whose members generally tithe 10 percent of all wages and earnings to their church. Those leaders insist that their only crime is following the true word of God -- they see the church's capitulation on polygamy as a blasphemous mistake. Sexual abuse is rare, they insist, and when it occurs it is not tolerated.,There are at least four major clans in Utah. One of these polygamous empires, based about 40 minutes south of Salt Lake, in Bluffdale, is run by Owen Allred, age 84. The state has long estimated its membership at about 5,000 people. But Janet Bennion, a Utah Valley State College anthropologist who spent five years studying the Allreds for a recent book, ''Women of Principle'' (Oxford University Press), says the number is closer to 10,000, with clusters all over the West.,At the Allred compound, the headquarters is a huge, windowless two-story building facing the Wasatch mountain range. Arrayed around it are massive houses, with two or three minivans in many of the driveways.,Lillian Bowles spent most of her life on this patch of arid land. She grew up in a trailer not far from Bluffdale's church, one of 40 children in a family in which her mother was one of eight wives. She is not even sure where she fits in the family chronology. ''I think I'm No. 17,'' she says. She remembers a life of claustrophobia and fear of the outside world. ''I knew early on that that what we were doing was against the law,'' says Bowles, who is 26. ''We were always taught to hide. We couldn't play in the front yard. When we drove somewhere, it was always 'Duck!' when you passed a police car.'',At 16, she wanted to leave. But like other women who have fled polygamy, she says she had no idea how to. ''We were taught early on that we were God's chosen people, and everyone else was condemned to hell. If you left, you were condemned.'' At age 17, she married a man who told her it was better to get married young, rather than wait to be a third or fourth bride. After six years of marriage, she says, Bowles left her husband when he decided take on another wife.,Rowenna Erickson, 59, told me a similar tale when she described her life within another major clan, the Kingstons. She married her brother-in-law, Charles L. Kingston, and produced eight children. ''The other wives kept telling me how this was all so wonderful because we were going to heaven,'' she says between baby-sitting chores for grandchildren in Salt Lake City. ''But if it was so wonderful, how come I felt so horrible?'',I asked her if she was ever in love with her husband. ''It was business,'' she says. ''Produce the babies. Don't question your husband. But still, you get jealous. I remember when my husband had his eyes on a very young girl. My sister and I were so hurt.'' She went on to explain a marital routine I heard from members of polygamous families all over Utah, a sexual-rotation schedule with all the romance of being a hen at a poultry ranch. ''When you're ovulating, the patriarch is called,'' she says.,Polygamous leaders tend to shrug off stories like those told by Bowles, Erickson and Chapman, dismissing them as bitterness with a political agenda. But they may have a more difficult time explaining away an episode that rocked Utah last spring, when a sobbing, badly bruised 16-year-old girl placed a 911 call from a truck stop in northern Utah. She told the police a story of indentured barbarism, alleging her father had forced her into becoming the 15th wife of her uncle. When she tried to flee, she maintained, she was whisked to a family ostrich ranch, taken into a barn and whipped by her father.,The leaders of the Kingston clan run one of the biggest and wealthiest family business empires in Utah. With 1,500 members and interests in everything from restaurants to casinos, the clan is worth $150 million or more, state officials estimate. The clan operates much of its business out of an old brick office on State Street just outside downtown Salt Lake City. The building has no identification on the outside, save an address.,In a December pretrial hearing, the girl gave a hint of what her life was like inside the clan. Her marriage was arranged by her father and uncle; the latter had sex with her the first time at her mother's home. ''I guess it was my night, so he came over,'' the girl testified. Then she was moved into a small apartment, with another wife, one door away from a third wife. All the while, the girl said, she was terrified. ''I felt trapped.'',The girl's uncle David O. Kingston has been charged with three counts of incest and one count of unlawful sexual conduct. Her father, John D. Kingston, has been charged with child abuse. The two brothers will be tried separately in April, and both have pleaded not guilty. (The father's lawyera and cousin -- Carl E. Kingston refused to talk to me.),But even in the face of the girl's court testimony that she had been forced to marry her uncle and join 14 other wives, the state has chosen not to bring polygamy charges.,To women like Laura Chapman, that decision by prosecutors not to enforce the anti-polygamy statue is just one more example of Utah's refusal to go after the practice that is at the core of the clans' existence. State officials insist the law is unenforceable because most polygamists have a marriage certificate only for the first bride; the others are sealed in church ceremonies, without a paper trail necessary for proof of crime. The last major attempt at prosecuting anyone on polygamy charges was in 1953, in Hildale/Colorado City -- then called Short Creek. A big raid on the compound was written about and photographed by Life magazine, and what resulted was a furor over families being torn apart by the state.,Last year, six women from plural marriages -- including Bowles, Erickson and Chapman -- founded one of the most unusual private outreach groups in the country, an advocacy organization called Tapestry of Polygamy. When such women hear Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah intone about the sanctity of law and President Clinton's sexual misdeeds, they want to shout from the top of the Mormon Temple: ''What about polygamy?'',Prompted in part by Tapestry, the state Attorney General's office recently sent emissaries to the Allred compound to discuss things like statutory rape, child abuse, the minimum wage and other basic legal facts of modern American life. They gave out phone numbers. According to the Attorney General's office, dozens of calls have come in -- women and children asking basic questions about the outside world.,When Chief Deputy Attorney General Reed Richards said last year that polygamy was not only nearly impossible to prosecute but, technically, not a crime at all, it took the largely poor and unschooled ex-wives of polygamous men to point out the law to him. Polygamy is in fact covered by the statute that makes bigamy a felony, the women noted, and the law says nothing about a marriage certificate being needed for proof of crime, only that a husband or wife ''purports to marry another person.'',I read that statute to Richards and mentioned that prominent polygamists in Utah had their own Web sites and seemed to be bragging about breaking the law. One man, Graydon Henderson, whom I spoke to, lives openly with his five wives and 21 children in a suburb just south of Salt Lake. ''I'm not a bit afraid of the law,'' he told me. ''It's not even worth worrying about.'',Richards finally said that he has no idea why polygamy was not prosecuted in his state. But he added, ''If we cracked down on it, I think it would all go underground.'',Carmen Thompson, another Tapestry co-founder, figures that what most of the people with power in Utah really want is for the ex-wives to go underground. Thompson, who is 41 and spent more than a decade as as one of eight wives, points to the polygamous roots of many members of the state's power structure. ''They all have this romantic view of how their grandfathers practiced it,'' she says. ''But this is not grandpa's polygamy. As near as I can tell, Brigham Young was not a pedophile.'',Mormons, from the very founding of their church by Joseph Smith Jr. in 1830, have been persecuted. Their fear of outsiders -- or gentiles, as non-Mormons are called in Utah, where 70 percent of the population identify themselves as Mormon -- is integral to their religious identity.,Smith told of how an angel appeared to him in upstate New York, directing him to gold plates bearing the story of ancient inhabitants of what is now Israel who had settled in the Western Hemisphere. That story forms the basis of the Book of Mormon, which with the Bible and Doctrine and Covenants are the sacred texts of the church. It is in the latter book, Section 132, where God tells the prophet Joseph Smith that he can marry as many women as he wants. ''And if he has 10 virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him and they are given unto him; therefore he is justified,'' Smith, with God speaking through him, explains.,Smith's successor, Brigham Young, took his followers West, establishing the territory of Deseret in what is now Utah. The Mormons prospered in the Great Basin, but their plural marriages were an affront to the rest of the country. In 1857 the United States nearly went to war with the religious state that had formed on the Wasatch Mountain front. President Buchanan sent troops to the Great Salt Lake. Eventually, under threat of having their assets seized, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (as the Mormon Church is formally known) denounced polygamy in 1890, saying it was no longer necessary. Ever since, Mormons who practice polygamy do so under threat of excommunication.,But for a swath of people who consider themselves true believers, this change of heart was mere political expediency. In Hildale/Colorado City today and in the Allred and Kingston compounds, residents consider themselves the followers of the true Mormon Church. In their view, the heretics are the ones operating out of Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake.,This history does not lend itself to easy sanitizing. On a tour of Temple Square, the global headquarters of the Mormon religion, one of the fastest-growing in the world, I asked the guide about Brigham Young's wives. We were in a former home of Young's, the Beehive House, about a block from the Temple, and the guide was explaining how the patriarch's wife made bread.,''Which wife?'' I asked. Young had 27.,''These other wives were mostly widows,'' the tour guide replied.,That sort of historical revisionism ends up infuriating both the women who have fled polygamy and the people who defend it. Chapman wants Utah's Mormons to acknowledge that some of their most revered founding fathers had child brides. Fundamentalists want the basic facts of the polygamists' past to remain a central part of the Mormon narrative.,What seems to interest outsiders the most about polygamy is the sex. The famed 19th-century eroticist, Sir Richard Burton, traveled to Utah to have a firsthand look at a practice he considered quite natural. Some people who defend modern polygamy take the same approach, saying men are, after all, promiscuous animals by nature. ''You look at the nature of men, and most of them are polygamous,'' says Mary Potter, who was once one of three wives of a policeman in a Salt Lake City suburb. (The family later split up.) She has now formed a group in support of plural marriages, and openly frets about ''having to wear a Scarlet P,'' as she calls the cries for legal action. ''In polygamy, men are properly channeled.'',She and other supporters of polygamy point to recent studies that maintain that men are evolutionally wired for multiple sexual partners. ''There's a desire on the part of men to have a diversity of mates -- it's their natural urge -- so sex is definitely a motivating factor for many of the patriarchs,'' says Janet Bennion, the anthropologist who has written about the Allred clan.,Viagra has been a blessing for a few of the older patriarchs, Bennion notes. ''Some members of the Allred group are using Viagra because they just can't keep up with their younger wives,'' she says. ''There is a big age difference for many of these men. If you've got three or four sexually active wives, that's a lot of work.'',Bennion is sympathetic to polygamous families and thinks it would be a terrible thing if the state started prosecuting them. While she concedes that there have been incidents of sexual abuse, marrying of relatives and ostracizing of older, less attractive wives within the clans, she believes polygamy can offer a sense of security and a kind of sisterhood to modern women, and that's what accounts for the continued growth.,With its reputation for divinely sanctioned promiscuity, the Hildale and Colorado City community attracts its share of misguided visitors, says Dan Barlow, who is the town's Mayor and an elder in the church that owns nearly every house here. ''They think what goes on here is all about sex,'' he says. ''It's foolish to make such a claim because we live a hundred miles or so from Las Vegas. If people want sex, that's where they should go.'',The Mayor took me on a tour. The houses he showed me were huge, some with as many as 15 to 20 bedrooms and others that looked more like half-finished motels or dormitories. On a weekday afternoon, every female in town was wearing an ankle-length dress.,All around town I glimpsed new additions to houses, businesses and public buildings. Church prophecies about millennial catastrophes have stepped up the pace of preparation for bad times, Barlow told me. We drove the wide streets, passing huge, never-finished houses. ''These are happy, joyous homes,'' Barlow said. With its extraordinary rate of reproduction, the community is growing by better than 10 percent a year, he said.,In conversation, the Mayor at times sounded defensive as he tried to explain his town's unique culture to a curious outsider. ''The roads lead in and out,'' he said. ''The telephone lines go both ways. Women are free to leave if they want.'',The law seemed a distant concern, but the raid of 1953 stands as a defining event. ''I was 21 at the time,'' Barlow told me. ''I had three children. They were made wards of the state. Is that what these women want?'',Laura Chapman sees things differently. What she remembers most about growing up was a sense of being a prisoner in a life with no escape route. At age 11, she was pulled out of public school and taught at home. At age 18, her father took her to see the clan's spiritual leader, LeRoy S. Johnson, now dead. The prophet, then in his 70's, had taken as one of his wives Chapman's 17-year-old sister, she says.,''He says, 'Let's take care of this right now,' and he calls in an 18-year-old boy,'' Chapman recalls. ''I got sick to my stomach. I told him I couldn't marry him. So, to get out of that marriage, I agreed to marry another boy. I was married in a week.'',She wanted to work outside the home; she says her husband told her no. She wanted to practice birth control; he said he would have nothing to do with her if she did, she says. ''I was in my late 20's before I even knew there was a law against statutory rape,'' says Chapman. ''When I finally got out, at age 28, I had the knowledge of the outside world of an 11-year-old.'',When her husband said he was ready to take another wife -- his 18-year-old cousin -- Chapman gathered up her five children and left. Ultimately she made it to college, and after seven years got a degree in sociology and human development (and has recently left Tapestry and plans to pursue a master's degree in social work). Her older sister, Rena Mackert, confirmed every detail of Chapman's life story. ''I'm proud of her,'' says Mackert. ''She was the most beaten-down child -- timid, afraid of her own shadow. My little sister has come a long way.'',Barlow scoffs at such tales. ''They're a bunch of soreheads, those women,'' he says. Yes, marriages are arranged on occasion, and almost always approved by a spiritual leader. But that is an ancient and respected practice, says Barlow. As for the allegations that boys paw at their sisters and old men prey on young girls, he shakes his head. ''Whenever you have people living together, you're going to have people problems, the same here as anywhere else.'',It seems improbable that these two conflicting views of reality can coexist indefinitely, and perhaps a clash is now inevitable. Prompted by the recent furor, two bills introduced in the current state legislative session directly target polygamy. One would raise the legal age of marriage from 14 to 16. The other would provide money and shelters for women who want to flee but may not meet the specific admittance rules of traditional halfway homes.,''What these women have brought into broad daylight is a civil rights issue that is second to none in the history of Utah,'' says State Senator Scott Howell, the leader of the Democratic legislative minority in Utah, who introduced one of the bills. ''Here, we've got all the world coming to town for the Olympics. Do we really want to be known as the place where we let old men marry little girls?'',For the women who brought polygamy out of Utah's closet, the 2002 Olympics remain the trump card. More than 10,000 visiting journalists will be deluged with information about the world's greatest snow, the glowing city in the Wasatch, the spotless facilities. And then, when they grow tired of the luge and the Tabernacle Choir stories, the press will have no trouble finding the women of Tapestry, who will tell them about Utah's other heritage.,''We toyed with the idea of giving out maps to the homes of famous polygamists, like maps to the stars,'' says Thompson, feeling the power of mischief. ''Wouldn't that be a tourist attraction?''",TIMOTHY EGAN,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Persistence of Polygamy,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/the-persistence-of-polygamy.html
"With Serbian troops apparently disregarding a NATO ultimatum to stop fighting in Kosovo and withdraw from the southern Serbian province or face air attacks, the allies could face the gravest test of their credibility since they forced a settlement of the war in Bosnia more than three years ago.,Time and again, the allies have been insisting since last spring that they would not stand by and watch, as they did for years in Bosnia, while Serbian forces committed atrocities against civilians. Yet not even the threat of 400 bombers, including B-52's, has been able to get the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, to agree to accept a force of 28,000 international peacekeepers for Kosovo as part of a settlement that would provide autonomy for the province.,With the threats aimed primarily against the Serbs, the military leaders of the ethnic Albanians who are fighting for independence for the province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, defied warnings from the Clinton Administration and its European allies that bombing would only go ahead if the Serbian side was clearly the main obstacle to an accord.,Threat may have turned to bluster last Tuesday after the peace talks in Rambouillet castle on the outskirts of Paris broke off with only half-agreement by the Albanian side.,Technically, the alliance's Secretary General in Brussels, Javier Solana, still has the authority the allies gave him on Jan. 28 to launch devastating attacks against Serbian forces. If the Serbs now launch large-scale attacks that produce numerous Albanian victims, Mr. Solana could come under heavy pressure from Washington to give the order.,But whether the European allies would clearly support military action now looks more doubtful than it did a week ago.,Nor is the credibility of the allied threat the only ambiguity. ''Everyone agrees that peacekeepers should be neither a substitute for the Kosovo Liberation Army nor an occupying force for the benefit of the Serbs,'' a senior French diplomat said, but the allies would be taking on a difficult balancing act on an unsteady tightrope if they went in.,Unlike the NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, in Kosovo allied soldiers, and others including Russian troops who would be expected to go in with them, would be operating on the territory of a foreign country, Serbia, that does not want them there.,And though most of the two million ethnic Albanians do want alliance troops in Kosovo, among the first things the peacekeepers would have to do is to fan out throughout the province and oversee the disarmament and disbanding of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the main rebel force.,The independence for which they are fighting is not an objective the peacekeeping force would support. In effect, the force would take over responsibility for the internal security of the province from the Serbian authorities who abolished its autonomy 10 years ago.,On the Serbian side, the peacekeepers would be expected to oversee the withdrawal of more than 15,000 Serbian military units, and about that many special police troops, from the province.,During the Rambouillet talks, however, the Serbs used the time to build up their forces in the area, moving some 4,500 heavily armored troops along the border with Kosovo. The rebels, too, took advantage of this time to regroup and rearm.,The draft accord, officials say, provides for 2,500 Serbian troops to patrol Kosovo's border with Albania during the three years the peacekeepers would be in the province, which will remain formally a part of Serbia.,Then, at the end of those three years, the peacekeepers would -- what, withdraw?,''We want to play for time,'' a French strategist said in explaining the plan recently. The hope seems to be that in three years Serbia's leader, Mr. Milosevic, who has vowed to keep Kosovo a part of Serbia forever, may be gone and more reasonable voices will be in power.,The hope seems far-fetched. Serbs have considered Kosovo sacred ground since Prince Lazar lost the Battle of Kosovo Field to the Turks in 1389.,In a sense, what the alliance proposes to take on is the task of trying to reconcile the Albanians in Kosovo with the harsh reality of continuing Serbian sovereignty.,The Albanians in Kosovo expect the alliance to protect them from the Serbs, but the danger is that in time the Albanians could come to see the peacekeepers as de facto surrogates for the Serbs.,And at the end of the three-year period, there is no guarantee that the ethnic Albanian population would get the independence that many there seek.,It took 60,000 NATO soldiers -- led by about 20,000 Americans and an American general -- going into Bosnia in December 1995 to carry out a peace accord signed by Mr. Milosevic and leaders of the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim sides in that conflict.,All the parties were exhausted after years of fighting; the Serbs had begun losing their war with the Croats and even to lose some ground they had taken earlier from the Bosnian Muslims.,In Kosovo there is no such exhaustion, and there will be no such American force. This time the 4,000 Americans who would go into Kosovo would be under the orders of a British force commander, though he would report to Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the American Supreme Allied Commander in Brussels.,For the alliance, this would be a new situation, one reflecting, finally, the European desire to take strategic responsibility for the security of Europe's own backyard in the Balkans.,The West decided last month that it would not tolerate war over the issue of independence for Kosovo.  But it may yet have to make war with Serbia to get it to accept autonomy. Even then, it may have to tolerate leaving peacekeepers in Kosovo for so long that they outstay their welcome, if the Albanian population sees no hope of eventual independence.",CRAIG R.

"Gov. George E. Pataki has quietly moved to make far-reaching changes in the state's special education program, long criticized as a dumping ground for children who should be in standard classrooms, by seeking to limit aid, and thus enrollment, for the first time.,Momentous as it is, the Governor has not trumpeted his plan. Instead, it is buried in an arcane passage deep in his 1999-2000 budget proposal, suggesting that the Governor may intend to link the plan to negotiations over other educational initiatives that the Legislature wants in the final budget.,The state's special education program has been widely assailed for consigning far too many children, a disproportionate number of them black and Hispanic boys in New York City, into separate classrooms with little prospect of getting out and graduating with a regular diploma.,A broad range of critics -- from state education officials to academics to lawmakers -- say this is partly because schools get additional money from the state for each child in special education. The financing formula, these critics contend, has led educators to find disabilities in children who are merely troubled or underachieving -- subverting the state's intent of giving extra care to the severely handicapped.,And the system is growing ever costlier: The amount New York spends on special education has risen to roughly $1.4 billion in the current school year from $527 million in the 1985-86 school year, making it one of the fastest-growing parts of the state budget and consuming 12 percent of all the money the state spends on aid to schools.,Mr. Pataki is proposing to replace the old formula with a system that gives districts a fixed sum of money for special education, based on their overall student population and level of poverty. The proposal would also limit the year-to-year growth of the program by no more than 2 percent per school district, thereby forcing school administrators to limit the number of children they refer to special education.,Aid for the small number of children with profound disabilities, like cerebral palsy, would not be affected by the new limits.,The timing of Mr. Pataki's proposal is critical. The Federal Government has repeatedly warned that New York State could lose more than $300 million if it does not reduce the number of children, particularly black and Hispanic students, who are shunted into special education classrooms away from other students.,Federal officials contend that a student should be educated in the ''least restrictive setting'' -- ideally a regular classroom -- unless that student cannot succeed there even with additional specialized services, like individual tutoring.,In addition, Federal officials have questioned the placement of thousands of black and Hispanic students in special education in New York City schools. The officials challenged Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew in a letter in November to show evidence that the students were being properly placed in special education. The letter cited a Federal analysis of data submitted by Dr. Crew showing that even among districts with the same rates of poverty, there were wide discrepancies in special education placements that appeared to be based on race or ethnicity.,Richard P. Mills, the State Education Commissioner, recently cautioned lawmakers during a hearing at the Capitol that officials in Washington could begin withholding aid as early as this July if the state fails to comply with their request.,In an interview on Friday, Mr. Mills reiterated the warning. ''I think it should be taken seriously,'' he said, adding, ''I think it is unfortunate that New York State would have to be threatened by the Federal Government to do the right thing.'',The state's special education system dispenses aid to schools using a formula that covers a broad range of disabilities, from deafness and blindness to more ill-defined conditions like emotional disturbances and learning disabilities.,But that system has come under intense attack from critics who say it has provided districts with a financial incentive to place children with relatively minor problems into expensive special education classes.,In New York City, for example, most special education students do not have readily defined disabilities like deafness or blindness. Instead, they are classified as being ''learning disabled'' or ''emotionally handicapped.'' Education experts contend that such labels are often loosely applied, particularly in cases in which teachers want to rid themselves of disruptive students.,Mr. Pataki's proposal differs from previous plans to overhaul the state's special education program in one key way: it would continue to fully pay for children with severe disabilities. As a result, the plan avoids any confrontation with a highly organized group of parents, teachers and other experts who work with these children and who have helped to defeat changes to the special education program in the past.,Nonetheless, Mr. Pataki's plan has its critics. The Governor wants to have it implemented by the 2000-2001 school year. That timetable has caused even the fiercest critics of the current program to complain that he is not giving school districts enough time to prepare for the changes he is seeking. By contrast, a similar plan being proposed by state education officials would gradually phase in changes to special education over seven years.,More important than that, though, is the fact that Mr. Pataki's plan does not include additional money to provide services to help moderately disabled children compete in regular classroom settings, a primary goal of some educational experts and the Federal Government.,Critics of the Governor's plan note that teachers in regular classes often lack the time or resources to deal with basic problems like poor reading skills, one of the main factors driving special education referrals.,Indeed, the state has roughly 400,000 children in special education now, up 100,000 in 13 years, with most of the growth in children identified as having learning disabilities like reading problems or attention deficit disorder. The critics of Mr. Pataki's plan are urging him to divert some money from the state's special education program into mainstream classrooms so that such patterns of referral are no longer necessary.,The critics note that the proposal being advanced by state education officials would spend, by contrast, at least $25 million more than the state currently spends to help moderately disabled children function in mainstream classes.,Lawrence Gloekler, a deputy commissioner with the State Education Department who helps administer the state's special education program, said that while he applauds the overall goal of Mr. Pataki's plan, he believes that school districts need additional time and money to help moderately disabled children adapt in regular classroom settings.,''Our biggest concern with the Governor's proposal is that it happens too quickly and doesn't give districts enough time to adjust,'' he said.,The Governor's proposal is the opening bid in what will surely be a lively debate with members of the  Legislature, where similar proposals have died in the past amid fierce lobbying from a powerful coalition of teachers and school administrators worried that any changes would decrease resources in the classrooms.,In the end though, Mr. Pataki may provide the additional money his critics desire in exchange for the enactment of the overall changes he is seeking.,Jeff Lovell, the Governor's deputy secretary for educational policy, said it was crucial for the Legislature to act now. ''The drumbeat from the Federal Government is growing louder,'' he said.

"THE AMATEUR,An Independent Life of Letters.,By Wendy Lesser.,274 pp. New York:,Pantheon Books. $24.,SINCE founding The Threepenny Review 20 years ago, Wendy Lesser has been nurturing the kind of essay undervalued in today's literary marketplace. Her ideal -- as described in her anthology of such writing, ''Hiding in Plain Sight'' -- is ''a piece of nonfiction prose that, while talking about something in the world at large, discusses and reveals the author's own personality as well. It does so with the rhythmic precision of a poem, and with the delicate evasiveness of a story. And it does so whether the essay is autobiographical or critical, whether it's explicitly about the author or explicitly about a work of art.'',With the 24 pieces that make up ''The Amateur,'' Lesser attempts something even more ambitious: a life portrayed in a series of such essays. Since Montaigne first tried his hand at it 400 years ago this has remained one of the toughest of literary genres to sustain. To Lesser's credit, she has succeeded admirably, producing a deeply humane, modest and beautifully constructed narration of an ''independent life of letters.'',For readers glutted by a decade's worth of sensationalist memoirs, ''The Amateur'' will be a welcome relief. Lesser spares us the predictable details of love, marriage, motherhood and illness (all of which, we learn along the way, have been part of her experience). She chooses instead to reflect upon how a sense of self, her self, was formed through the interplay of the accidents of place and time (in her case northern California from the 1950's to the 1990's) in the course of a life hopelessly entangled with literature, dance and theater.,Lesser is most revealing about herself when she is examining her response to art; this is doubly fortunate, because she has the gift of enabling a reader to grasp the deeper workings of art forms, both high and low, in the act of describing how they affect her. Take Lesser's reflections on her childhood discovery of fading copies of Unknown Worlds magazine in the family garage. They offer the most concise account I have come across of both science fiction and adolescent anomie: ''As a denizen of the California suburbs, I grew up feeling the absence of something, knowing that a deeper layer of significance ought to lie behind the flatness of my surroundings. My first response to this longing was to immerse myself in science fiction, which made up the bulk of my reading from age 10 to age 16. . . . The reason much science fiction seems banal is that it is so obviously a search for significance. . . . It gives those who believe in rationality the assurance that something larger than randomness or human ineptness is at the root of our existence.'',While Lesser likes to tease out meaning from the ordinary events of daily life, she seems equally pleased when the serendipitous proves a source of wonder. The best example is her essay on ''A Night at the Opera,'' with its nod to the zaniness of the Marx Brothers. What begins as an innocuous visit to the first-aid room at the San Francisco opera house (a curry dinner had upset her stomach) turns into a moving account of how life's unexpected pleasures mirror and surpass those of art. A quiet spectator to the parade of visitors to the aid station, Lesser discovers that the most exciting drama is that which catches us unprepared: ''So this is where all the action was at the opera. Forget the rusty plot proceeding on stage; this was the locus of the soul-searing story, this the place where real emotions were bared and acted upon.'' At the heart of the essay is the aid station's nameless attendant, an embodiment of negative capability and a lot like Lesser herself: able to shift ''from the gentle, knowledgeable dispenser of advice to the friendly, untutored amateur, eager to learn from another.'',LESSER'S most memorable essay may be ''Ralph.'' Ralph, her cat, has a cancerous nose. Lesser can't afford cat chemo, but she can cover the cost of what turns out to be a successful treatment: cutting off Ralph's nose. The essay disarmingly begins with the truism ''It is commonly observed that people resemble their pets,'' and ends with an initially squeamish Lesser coming to accept that it ''is not that we really look like our pets, but that we come to understand our own characters by observing theirs'': ''I missed the way he used to look -- any cat has it, that beautiful Egyptian profile. . . . And I hated the way he sounded when he sneezed. But I learned to live with it remarkably well, for me. Accommodation was never my strong point; it was always Ralph's. But by the time he died -- of old age, as the vet had promised -- we had long since met halfway.'',Near-invisible threads connect many of the essays in this carefully organized book. There are also more obvious groupings, none more successful than her triptych on dance -- ''Dance Lessons,'' ''Passionate Witness'' and ''Portrait of a Ballerina''; the set moves from her own (yes, amateur) experiences as a dancer to an extraordinary piece on Mark Morris before culminating in a poignant encounter with an aging Balanchine dancer living with her memories in Beverly Hills. As someone who usually struggles to read past the first paragraph of a dance review, I found Lesser's ability to capture the intellectual excitement of dance while allowing the uninitiated a glimpse at its mysteries one of the most satisfying things in this book. Educated at Harvard, Cambridge and Berkeley, Lesser flirted briefly with an academic future before taking on the more precarious existence of a literary editor. Her choice of title -- ''The Amateur'' -- speaks not only of her decision to steer clear of the academic profession but also of her recognition that amateurs don't get paid much for what they do. In compensation, she has gained the freedom to pursue what she loves (it's what the word ''amateur'' means, or once meant, after all), be it the poetry of Thom Gunn, a photograph by George Platt Lynes, or the latest episode of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue.'',AT a time when it's unusual to find a leading poet, novelist or public intellectual under 60 without some sort of university affiliation, Lesser's story makes clear what is sacrificed in a society that has little room for amateurs. One loss is the dwindling of the number of critics who, like her, refuse ''to have arbitrary lines drawn between things: between old masterpieces and contemporary works, between art and the rest of the world, between criticism and conversation.'' When Lesser describes herself as an ''18th-century man of letters, though one who happens to be female and lives in 20th-century Berkeley,'' she is rightly lamenting the loss of a world -- at least outside of a few outposts like Berkeley -- that can sustain ''coffeehouses, scruffy artists, notorious lawbreakers and underemployed literary types'' like herself.,''The Amateur'' ends with a very strong essay -- ''My Imaginary New York Life'' -- which returns the reader to an earlier piece on New York and the writer's life, ''In Washington Square.'' If her book begins with a California suburbanite envious of New York writers who inhabit both a point in a landscape and a place in the mind, it ends with her liberation from this fate: ''I was not, after all, going to have a New York life. I had become pretty much the person I had planned to be, but without ever moving to New York. Apparently the New York self was not as essential a part of me as I had once imagined.'' Her farewell to New York is also implicitly a rejection of what one might call a New York kind of writing: brilliant, often chilly prose of surface effects, writing that competes with its subject for attention, writing whose pleasures are of the moment.,What Lesser offers us instead is a style that's a lot like dance -- fluid, arresting, with simple, strong movement. Its rewards are different and less frequently encountered. What Lesser writes at one point about a particularly satisfying performance also holds true for ''The Amateur'': the ''pleasure is still there, long after the dance is over.''",JAMES SHAPIRO,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Passionate Observer,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/the-passionate-observer.html

"MERCIFULLY, the impeachment vote was at hand, acquittal was already a certainty, and that new thing with feathers, ''closure,'' seemed a cheery possibility for the nation. Yet in the final hours of the Senate's trial of President Clinton, Republicans were still proposing more subjects for investigation. Rumors of Presidential tape recordings were gravely cited along with an 11th-hour affidavit from a reporter allowed to intrude Pirandello-like into the story. ''We don't want any grassy-knoll theories or dangling questions left in case someone like Oliver Stone ever tries to make a movie about this,'' a ranking Republican staffer explained straight-faced in announcing fresh kindling for the 13-month-long conflagration.,Whether it be set in Oliver Stone's Amerika or the Marx Brothers' Freedonia, the very idea of remilking the mass entertainment aspect of the,debilitating Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr saga seemed the year's ultimate obscenity. For, as the Senate prepared to vote, a stake-in-the-heart ending of the thing was at hand by all the Constitution's sacred writ and the public's smoldering indifference.,But no. Less than two weeks after his acquittal, President Clinton once more has had to gingerly decline elaboration on his latest flat denial of a Jane Doe story of sexual allegation flaring up from the oily residue of his impeachment struggle. What's more, scandal escapists should be warned that juicy bits from Monica Lewinsky's oath-free television interview with Barbara Walters -- a prelude to The Book -- have already been strategically leaked to stoke viewership for this week's next episode of a story most people claim to be sick of. And, lest justice not be endlessly served, ground rules are being negotiated for a new investigation, this time of the fairness of the investigation of the President's investigator, Kenneth W. Starr. And, of course, Mr. Starr will have an extra year's jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Clinton, private citizen, once he leaves office.,''It never ends,'' exults Matt Drudge, the Internet scandalmonger who served up the Lewinsky story and led America to its groaning board feast upon sex and mendacity. ''I did hope the Senate would keep Clinton: I needed the hits.'',And here we all are looking for something fresh and wholesome. President Clinton's Arbor Day speech, perhaps, or a regained perch on that bridge to the 21st century.,Rather, Webster Hubbell's next fraud trial by Mr. Starr's Whitewater -- remember Whitewater? -- prosecutors begins in late spring. And Hillary Rodham Clinton may be called as a witness, just when she's somehow tempted by the idea of electoral office in her own right as her husband's career slowly closes out. Closure? No, the story goes forward, by limp and squiggle. When all else fails, there's always nostalgia on CNBC and Fox-TV with nether-night reruns of the flinching Betty Currie footage, the beret rope-line tableau and, evermore, the wagging finger.,''What would it take to make it end?'' Mark Russell, the capital's resident political humorist, asks of the scandal story. ''Saddam Hussein at Camp David. Or John Doe No. 5. Fifteen percent unemployment by the Easter recess? Jane Doe Nos. 5 through 26 on '20-20.' '' Mr. Russell pauses, as if at wit's end about it all. ''How about at the Academy Awards Elia Kazan names Charlton Heston as a Communist?'',B UT it becomes harder to laugh at the story that wraps around itself, at ''this daily mud-slide into the nation's living rooms,'' as David E. Bonior, the House Democratic whip, described it last fall. He failed to defeat impeachment, but he left a ringing question: ''Do we really want two more years of Monica Lewinsky? Two more years of Linda Tripp?'' That now seems an existential question. (The political comedian Al Franken comments, ''I think the next phase of the story will be articles like yours.''),For sheer durability, the story is beginning to resemble a toxic waste dump of fetid ingredients and methane energies. The news media cannot afford not to see the story through. The President's enemies, naturally, stand ready to continue feeding the pile. And then there are the sorry deposits offered by President Clinton himself, whose search for historic legacy seems increasingly overwhelmed by vapors from the past.,Gamboling in the unsensational agenda of yore, House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt was fairly trilling his way last week through a masterful riff on the looming Social Security issue when he was suddenly asked, ''What's your reaction to the Juanita Broaddrick allegations?'' A heartfelt sigh was his purest reaction to the Jane Doe No. 5 story about the emergence of apparently unprovable rape charges against Mr. Clinton. ''Boy, the frustration I sense out there among people about continuing all of this dialogue is palpable,'' Mr. Gephardt began, patiently observing what the nation now well knows, that the legal system has ''all kinds of mechanisms'' for dealing with this latest tangent in the unending story.,Optimists should note that House Republicans, the main force behind impeachment, are reported scandal weary. ''There's a death rattle from a few people still calling my office, the kind who think the Clintons killed Vince Foster,'' said Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican who was inundated with critics' complaints two months ago when he opposed impeachment. ''But there was silence -- not even a hint about the impeachment -- at this week's Republican conference,'' he related approvingly. ''The specter's out there. But there's a feeling that maybe if we don't talk about it, it won't come back.'',Some observers find the body politic scarred with media needle tracks. ''It really is like a narcotic,'' says Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. ''You can't just go cold turkey if you're all-Monica, all-the-time.'' He finds the latest twist, the long-rumored rape allegation, troublesome because it reached mainline newspapers after the acquittal when the staunchly anti-Clinton Wall Street Journal editorial page provided an outlet. Such a polemical spark could muddy traditional journalism, Mr. Kovach worries.,To the contrary, one of the President's defenders from impeachment, Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, sees progress in the Jane Doe postscript. ''If Jane Doe 5 emerged a year ago, there would have been far wider acceptance,'' he says. ''The Lewinsky experience has made the media more careful and people more skeptical.'',Or maybe more inured, in the view of Mark Shields, a political analyst whose normal spirit of relishing knockabout politics is notably absent from this story that will not die. ''I think this thing is going to be with us,'' he estimates, wary as a character in those movies about the hockey-mask fiend. ''Maybe not in the sense of the consciousness of the country, of people talking about it. But it will manifest itself in what we look for in a potential President the next time -- someone with no surprises.''",FRANCIS X. CLINES,"FEB. 28, 1999",Over Time; The End Was a Mirage.

"There are various ways in which anglers and hunters in the Northeast deal with the long pauses in their activities, enforced by both the weather and the legal seasons.,Some languish. Others use the slack time to ready their gear or plan expeditions. All, however, eagerly await the start of open-water trout fishing, turkey hunting or the first spring runs of striped bass or bluefish along the coast. This yearning can be honed by delving into the literature of the sport of choice, but for some the most expeditious entry into a state of anticipatory delight is to attend a late-winter show.,One of the best such events in the region is the annual World Fishing and Outdoor Exposition, which runs Thursday through next Sunday at the Rockland Community College Field House in Suffern.,Attendance at the show can be particularly valuable to those who have an urge to hunt or fish in a new area or to go whitewater rafting or canoeing in the wilderness. Under one roof one can visit booths staffed by representatives of states and provinces or by guides, charter boat skippers, outfitters or lodge operators.,And those who already know where their next outdoor adventure will be might want a new fishing rod or reel, or fowling piece. Exhibitors at the exposition, now in its 22d year, will be offering show discounts on many such items. People with a hankering for a new fly rod for trout can test it on a 50-foot casting pool.,The American mania for competitive angling is recognized in the show's Metro New York Open Challenge, a ''virtual reality'' big-game fishing contest open to all and sponsored by The Fisherman Magazine. Strapped into a fighting chair with big-game rod and reel in hand, contestants watch actual underwater footage of Pacific sailfish or mahi-mahi striking a lure and hurtling away. The rod bends and line peels from the reel as the fish runs. A computerized scoring machine measures how well the angler deals with the fish's struggle.,Next Sunday, there will be a Bassmaster casting competition for youngsters 7-10 and 11-14, sponsored by Zebco and Kmart. Winners go on to compete at the state level, and the top finishers meet in the final, which is held in conjunction with the 1999 BASS Masters Classic later this year; scholarships worth a total of $20,000 are awarded.,New at the show this year is ''Wildlife on Wheels,'' a display of various live animals including several whitetail deer, a black bear, a cougar, an elk and a wolf.,As in previous years, the Raptor Education Foundation's popular display of live birds will feature eagles, hawks, falcons and owls. All are birds that were physically or emotionally damaged, rescued and rehabilitated.,Professional anglers will demonstrate casting and retrieving techniques with various lures, both topwater and deep-running, in a 6,000-gallon glass-sided tank stocked with hungry black bass. Among these pros will be Penny Berryman, the 1992 Bass N' Gals Classic Star World Champion. And for those more interested in oceangoing striped bass, Bob Rochetta, will tell how he consistently catches huge stripers, including the one he took off Montauk in 1981, at 76 pounds still the men's world record for the species on 50-pound test line.,Both Berryman and Rochetta will take part in the show's seminars, which will be held every day. Open at no additional cost to all ticket holders, these sessions, conducted by experts, range through many aspects of freshwater and saltwater angling. For estuary fishermen, Manny Luftglass will conduct two seminars on fishing the tidal portions of New Jersey's rivers and its bays. Mike Laptew will make two angling presentations.,There will also be seminars on hunting deer and wild turkeys. Pursuers of the turkey might also wish to see the exhibit of the various sub-species of American wild turkeys assembled by Halley Caller Wildlife Calls, and those who enjoy the additional challenge of hunting deer with muzzle-loading firearms would benefit from catching one of Dave Ehrig's two final-day sessions.,HOW TO GO,The Rockland Community College Field House can be reached by taking the New York State Thruway (Interstate 287) to exit 14B (Airmont Road). Follow the signs to the show. Parking is free. Daily admission is $9 for adults, $3 for children. Those under 5 are admitted free. Hours are 2-9 P.M. Thursday, 1-9:30 P.M. Friday, 9:30 A.M.-7 P.M.

"THE only thing that Long Islanders and Californians have in common is our almost religious dedication to the automobile. We love to drive, even if we don't get anywhere because of all the other drivers. The Long Island Rail Road is regarded as a necessary evil at best.,There are also buses on Long Island, but aside from the Hampton Jitney, which Manhattanites use to become Hamptonites, nobody seems to know where they go, or when, or why. So, in the spirit of those intrepid journalists who risk anything to bring back a story, I determined to take a ride on the bus that seems to pass closest to our house.,I say ''seems to pass,'' because exact information is hard to find. There are no visible bus stops or timetables. When I asked our neighbors, who have lived here a long time, they looked at me as if I had asked about the times of flights to Mars. The people huddled at the invisible bus stop were not much more informative. They suggested that a bus might or might not come ''soon,'' which was not the kind of precise information I wanted.,So I started stalking the buses -- parking at various strategic corners, stopwatch in hand, noting times and numbers. You have to admire the dedication of bus riders who do this all the time.,Also, the only way to discover where the buses actually go is to follow them, which can take hours. If you don't have a car of your own, it can also mean some whopping taxi bills.,My research revealed that a bus marked, mysteriously, ''S62 Hauppauge'' would probably pass through Wading River, a mile from our house, at about 9:15 in the morning. I dialed the bus information number and a polite lady confirmed, as if was the most obvious thing in the world, that of course there would be a bus at 9:15.,How does one pay a bus fare in Suffolk County? Is it essential to have exact change, or a special card or token purchased in advance from the office in Yaphank? I took a handful of singles and coins and, just to be safe, a $20 bill, checkbook, four credit cards, some New York subway tokens and an old gold watch I had inherited. One of these must be acceptable.,On the fateful morning, I walked from the house to a random spot on the main road. Nobody else was waiting, and I stood in a small pool of mud, quietly freezing to death in the wind, feeling exposed and conspicuous. Kindly neighbors stopped to ask if I needed a lift.,No, I said, I'm taking the bus today. They rolled up their windows and drove away, shaking their heads.,Suddenly, the bus came roaring along, right on time. The driver slammed on his brakes at the last minute and deluged me with more mud. He was uninterested in where I wanted to go, and made no reply to my questions. He just pointed at the coin box, where I was required to deposit $1.50 in hard cash.,As this modest fare suggested, the interior of the bus had all the charm and comfort of a veteran subway car. Most of the few passengers were too young to have driver's licenses and too restless to stay at home. They glanced at me with suspicion and retreated into the fantasy world of their Walkmans.,The bus springs had seen better days, indeed better decades, and our taciturn driver drove briskly with one hand, using a technique obviously perfected at Riverhead Raceway. There was no danger of falling asleep and no chance of reading or writing. So I sat there enjoying the scenery, holding on to the fillings in my teeth and improving my Spanish. After a few stops and a few hundred twists and turns through the suburban back streets, I began to wish I had had a lighter breakfast, or none at all.,As a concession to lost and anxious passengers, the bus actually carried a rack of timetables. I seized one of these, and discovered that the Smith Haven Mall was on our route. This seemed like a good place to end my ride and, in fact, everyone jumped off at the mall. The bus continued empty toward Hauppauge.,The timetable showed 15 minutes to go until the next eastbound bus. This is perfectly calculated. It is exactly enough time to walk around the entire mall, convince yourself that you can live without any of this stuff, and get back to the bus stop.,The return bus, fresh in from Hauppauge and right on time, had a more friendly and less competitive driver, a woman. So we wound our way back toward Wading River with a pleasant chat about child care and health problems.,There was one surprise at the end of the journey. For reasons best known to the operators -- perhaps to avoid passenger boredom -- the buses follow a different route on the way back. So I was dumped out on the highway, four miles from my house, in the middle of a rainstorm. This time, nobody stopped to offer me a lift.,This experience has convinced me that more people should ride our local buses: preferably other people. Buses are an incredible transportation bargain. They promote healthy exercise and save you from doing too much shopping. They are good for the environment, quick and reliable, and they provide an intellectual challenge for passengers trying to discover the timetable. Buses could and should become Long Island's transportation system of the future: the very distant future, I hope, after the doctors have taken my driver's license away.",DAVID BOUCHIER,"FEB. 28, 1999",OUT OF ORDER; A Bus Stop Is Where It Started,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/out-of-order-a-bus-stop-is-where-it-started.html
"HANNA INGBER is a senior at Goshen High who believes, emphatically, that her school should dispense free condoms to students. The school says this will not happen, and since Ms. Ingber will be in college in the fall, it is easy to see that she will not get her way any time soon.,But for now, Ms. Ingber, who is 17, has Goshen in a dither.,With skill, determination and an instinct for using the news media, Ms. Ingber has forced Goshen to pay attention to her, just as she forced the school system to give her the middle school auditorium for a forum on condoms last week. If her campaign has brought a blast of unwanted publicity to Goshen, she said, that's too bad. This town had to wake up.,Ms. Ingber's panel of experts all turned out to favor providing condoms to high school students. Several hundred parents showed up and many objected, but the experts recited statistics to prove them wrong.,''The reality is, children are going to have sex, with or without your consent,'' said Bradley S. Shippee, a panelist who teaches AIDS prevention in prisons.,Ms. Ingber added, ''Just as school is a place to get a bagel if you've forgotten your lunch, or a Band-Aid or a tampon, high school should be one more place to get a condom.'',Until about a year ago, Ms. Ingber was known mainly as the founder of Students Advocating Animal Rights, which pickets rodeos and circuses and holds a vegan Thanksgiving dinner. But then she developed the condom campaign, and while some classmates think she's a pain, some grown-ups have developed a frank admiration for her and her ability to work the system.,''I've had a couple of people say to me that she reminds them fondly of the 60's,'' said James Langlois, the Superintendent of Schools. ''We live in a time of a low level of activism, and I have at times wished there was more. Not the issues that she is focused on, but I like the model of political activism that she has put up in front of the community.'',''I've always been the one who speaks up, and I've always been proud of that,'' Ms. Ingber said. Her first experience in outspokenness came in eighth grade, when, for a social studies assignment to produce posters about current political issues, students made art on abortion, animal rights and other topics that the principal said were too hot to display.,''He said, 'These are too controversial and we don't want to upset anybody.' The teacher just stood there cowardly and didn't say anything, and most of the students just sat there,'' Ms. Ingber said, recalling the incident. ''I just kept raising my hand and saying, 'Wait a minute, this is our assignment and both sides are represented and what's going on?' '',Last spring, in another school exercise, Ms. Ingber and other Goshen delegates to an Orange County student convention called Using Government chose condom distribution as their convention platform.,''There is so much sex going on that the parents and teachers refuse to acknowledge, and even though these kids are taught safe sex, they're not practicing it, and that scares the daylights out of me,'' Ms. Ingber said. ''Of all the people who I know have had unprotected sex, I ask, 'If you had had a condom with you, would you have used it?' and the answer is always yes, and that proves that sex education works and that the problem is availability.'',The student convention rejected the Goshen condom proposal, but by then Ms. Ingber had turned her attention to a real government -- the Goshen Unified School District. When she decided the school system was giving her proposal the run-around -- officials kept talking about advisory committees -- she went to The Times Herald-Record of Middletown, which produced a front-page story about her, accompanied by a photo of Goshen High students flourishing condoms.,That story drew the attention of a disk jockey named Rockin' Steve from the Poughkeepsie rock radio station, WPDH. He spent a morning handing out condoms to students in front of the high school during his radio show. Some made the condoms into balloons and kicked them around.,''She knows how to use the media, and she's using you, too,'' Mr. Langlois told a certain reporter politely. ''I don't know many high school kids who would call up The New York Times.'',The local coverage embarrassed a lot of people and angered some students. ''It's given us a bad name,'' said Matt Quick, a junior who sat on the panel as an opponent of condom distribution in school. ''At the home basketball game against Burke, the opposition fans were shouting 'condom kids' at us.'',Yet the key to Ms. Ingber's resolve may lie precisely in her knowledge that for the insurgent, there is no such thing as bad publicity.,''A lot of people in the town were really upset,'' she said, ''but it just brought a lot of attention to the issue, and that is the most important thing. It was our publicity that got Goshen awakened to what we were doing.'',Both of Ms. Ingber's parents are lawyers, and Ms. Ingber aspires to go to Yale and to have a career in the law. ''I guess my background prepares me for arguing and, you know, logical thinking,'' she said.,The parent opposition at the forum had three things to say about her plan: that teen-agers who are mature enough to have sex are mature enough to go to Planned Parenthood on Greenwich Avenue to pick up free condoms, that school condoms send the wrong message and that condoms can fail.,''Instead of playing Russian roulette with two bullets in the gun, you seem to be saying, 'Well, let's tell the kids to play Russian roulette with only one bullet,' '' Mike Grady, the father of a second grader, told the panel.,''My father never talked to me about sex,'' Mr. Shippee responded, ''but you know what? I think it's time all parents started teaching their kids about sex.'',That idea, teaching, turned out to be the middle ground on which both sides could meet. Mr. Langlois, who had some apprehension about the meeting, left it a happy man. ''A community can deal with condoms on its own,'' he said, ''but education is something we can all believe in.''",IVER PETERSON,"FEB. 28, 1999",Our Towns; Young Activist Forces Debate On Hot Topics,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/our-towns-young-activist-forces-debate-on-hot-topics.html
"With its dramatic hulking peaks and solitary valleys, its broad still lakes and mountain tarns, the Lake District in northwestern England is not only one of the most romantic landscapes in the world, it is also one of the most important sites in Romantic literature. This is Wordsworth country, after all, and it is from this district, at once so wild and so pastoral, that one of England's greatest poets drew his deepest inspiration.,Yet for me, the region has always been most hauntingly evoked not by William Wordsworth's famous poetry but by his sister Dorothy's less well-known prose. Her ''Grasmere Journal,'' named after the small town where brother and sister settled together in 1799, is by most reckonings a small masterpiece, noted for its simple, lucid descriptions of a landscape and a vanished way of life.,''[William] is now reading Ben Jonson. I am going to read German. It is about 10 o'clock, a quiet night. The fire flutters, and the watch ticks.'',''Wordsworth and his exquisite Sister are with me,'' Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote to a mutual friend, shortly after meeting the Wordsworths in 1797. ''She is a woman indeed! ... her eye watchful in minutest observation of nature -- and her taste a perfect electrometer -- it bends, protrudes and draws in at subtlest beauties and most recondite faults.'',Both William and Dorothy were born at Cockermouth, a comfortable merchant town on the northern edge of the Lake District. Their childhood home, now a National Trust property, is an unexpectedly handsome mansion set in a fine garden on the River Derwent. The property belonged to the Earl of Lonsdale, for whom their father, John Wordsworth, worked as a solicitor. In March 1778, when William was 7 and Dorothy 6, their mother died and the five Wordsworth children were dispersed among different households in different parts of England. Five years later, in 1783, John Wordsworth died, leaving a small inheritance -- all of which was tied up in a loan he had made to Lord Lonsdale. When the wealthy earl refused to honor his debt, the Wordsworth children were hard pressed to scrape a living; they received no money until Lonsdale's death in 1802 (in one of history's more intriguing crossed paths, the lawyer who secured the Wordsworths their inheritance was Edward Christian, brother of Fletcher, the mutineer of the Bounty, who was also from Cockermouth).,Dorothy and William's move to Grasmere at the end of 1799 represented the fulfillment of a long-held dream, to be re-united in the beloved landscape of their childhood. The ensuing frugal years passed in the small cottage that they rented in Grasmere village were among the happiest of their lives, for Dorothy, perhaps, the very happiest. Her journal is the daily record of those years -- the storms and snows and sunshine, the grand vistas of the momentous landscape and the small details of its mosses, flowers and forests, the songs of its birds and its soothing and unsettling silences. Dorothy's eyes and exquisite sensibility are everywhere; in his verse, Wordsworth showered his sister with heartfelt thanks for awakening him to the stirring beauty of the land around them. And from Dorothy's own humble prose flash images familiar to readers of the poetry of those two giants, Wordsworth and Coleridge.,''I never saw daffodils so beautiful,'' Dorothy wrote of a walk taken by Ullswater Lake in April 1802. ''They grew among the mossy stones about and about them; some rested their heads upon these stones as on a pillow for weariness; and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind ... '',For me, these words do more to evoke that heady walk of nearly two centuries past than do her brother's overquoted lines describing the same scene:,I wandered lonely as a cloud,That floats on high o'er vales and hills,,When all at once I saw a crowd,,A host, of golden daffodils;,Beside the lake, beneath the trees,,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.,Both of the Wordsworths were great walkers, and they matter-of-factly covered miles of terrain in all seasons and all weathers in the course of their rugged daily lives. They also occasionally embarked upon formidable walking tours farther afield. On their journey to rent Grasmere Cottage, taken in December 1799, they covered 10 miles in ''driving snow showers'' over mountain roads in 2 hours and 15 minutes ''by the watch,'' as William recorded.,Among the most haunting aspects of the Lake District are those unfolded in Dorothy's account of her daily domestic routine: The favorite view over Rydal Water, for example, or the familiar track to the neighboring town of Ambleside to get the mail, or up into the ''Black Quarter,'' in the foothills above their cozy house.,''The moonlight lay upon the hills like snow''; ''The lights were very grand upon the woody Rydale hills. Those behind dark and topp'd with clouds''; '' .t. . the moon came out from behind a mountain mass of black clouds. O, the unutterable darkness of the sky . . . '',Today, the Lake District is one of the most popular places for hiking in Britain. I came to it, however, not to hike, but to walk. I wanted briefly to see the world as this TK woman had once perceived it, when life was conducted on foot, when inspiration was sought not only on the lofty heights of hard-won peaks but also just outside the kitchen garden, or on a stroll at close of day. I came to Grasmere intent on taking a few of Dorothy's favorite walks.,Dove Cottage, Grasmere. All Wordsworth pilgrimages should start here, outside the door of the small, sturdy white cottage set in its attractively overgrown garden where the Wordsworths took up residence on a cold, raw December day in 1799. Dorothy slaved for three weeks straight after her arrival, cleaning, scrubbing, papering and arranging her new home. In the room of dark-paneled wood that was once her bedroom, I saw that someone had placed a small jar of garden flowers on the mantelpiece, and this artless touch was so ''right'' that the effect of privacy invaded was startling. It was a soft Indian summer day, and in this unexpected warmth and sunlight the cottage seemed a very desirable place indeed; it was easy to forget the damp cold and smoke-belching chimney that Dorothy describes. The houses opposite did not exist in her time, and the upstairs windows would have looked directly out onto Rydal Water and the surrounding wooded hills.,Leaving the cottage, my friend George and I set out on the lane that curves up the adjacent hill, and with these few steps the town of Grasmere, with its visitors and tourists, was left completely behind. Stone walls overhung with berry bushes and late flowers flanked the lane before it became a footpath, leading under trees and beside a marshy pond. We skirted a field and soon arrived at a low vantage point with views over Rydal Water.,''Rydale was very, very beautiful. The surface of the water quite still, like a dim mirror. The colors of the large island exquisitely beautiful, and the trees still fresh and green were magnified by the mists.'',The path descended behind Rydal Mount, the imposing house that was the Wordsworths' last home; but I postponed my visit there and continued on to the opposite side of Rydal Water, the small lake nestled, at this crossover point, in trees. There was no craft of any kind on the lake itself, which was still and unmarked -- untouched, it seemed at that moment, by time or anything else (a chief virtue of the conservation management of the region is that no power boats are allowed on the lakes). The path cut away from the water into trees -- emerging abruptly onto the A591 roadway. The words of one of my guidebooks were suddenly vivid: ''The modern A591 has done much to destroy the rural peace this Lakeland valley doubtless once possessed.'' Tenaciously, I held firm to the memory of the unruffled lake, and it is this I ultimately carried away.,''The Black Quarter'' was the Wordsworths' name for a region in the hills above Grasmere called Easedale, because it was from here that all bad weather seemed to come. For us, however, the sunny weather of the day before held, and it was under blue skies that we set out from Grasmere again, equipped with a picnic lunch that we had picked up in the nearby town of Keswick; one benefit, at least, of Britain's membership in the European Union is that good French cheese and wine can now be purchased in local shopping centers.,A stony path took us through glistening green fields grazed by fat white sheep and one proprietorial ram, whose shaggy black wool seemed flung loosely over him, like an overcoat. Some distance farther, we picked our way across boggy ground to a hillock of dry grass beside a fast-flowing stream. Here we dozed beside the remains of our picnic, while the running water carried off all sound -- such as it was, being mainly the distant blehs of sheep. Dorothy used to walk up here to gather mosses for her garden: ''The Black Quarter looked marshy . . . The Lichens are now coming out afresh, and I carried home a collection in the afternoon.'',Above our picnic stream, the cascade that foamed down the hill face was in glorious full spate; to the Wordsworths this was affectionately known as Churn-Milk Force, on account of its milky froth (it is now called Sour Milk Gill). Over a small ridge, we walked down to Easedale Tarn, which, like all tarns I saw, had a touch of something unnatural in its aspect; one had the impression that its impassive stillness penetrated all the way down to dark, deep depths, and that its surface should be brushed only very carefully. On the far shore, a young man was flying a kite from a fern-covered slope, while a file of ducks paraded around the water's edge. From the wall of mountain rock at the head of the tarn, shafts of low sunlight radiated in dramatic prisms; only the wall itself was lost in darkness -- a gulf beyond.,''The quietness and still seclusion of the valley affected me even to producing the deepest melancholy.'',I could understand this. We made our descent to Grasmere on the far bank. Once back on the level ground, we came up to an older man, walking cheerfully at a brisk clip. ''It's my 64th birthday,'' he said, in passing, then waved his stout walking stick at the green fields, as if to say, ''What a way to spend it!'',Some six miles northeast of Grasmere, as the crow flies, is Ullswater, a long, crooked lake that is regarded as one of the most pristine in the Lakes. While its western shore is flanked by a road, a full quarter of the length of its eastern shore is accessible only on foot. Friends of the Wordsworths had settled on the lake's far eastern tip, and Dorothy and William made numerous visits to them, taking long walks along the water, or inland toward the mountain known as Martindale. Although something of a hike, Ullswater was within the Wordsworths' domestic sphere.,The weather was alternately bright and overcast when we set out for Ullswater. Our plan was to drive slowly up the western shore of the lake, and then set out walking from Howtown, the point on the eastern shore where the paved road finished. With wind lashing at the gray lake water, we stopped to pay brief homage to a spot near Gowbarrow Park, an indifferent strip of land beside the lake where it is thought Dorothy's -- and William's -- dancing daffodils were seen.,From the sleepy pier at Howtown, a country lane led up to a headland above the water. Choosing our moment, when all clouds had momentarily been blown aside, we settled on a mossy spot set back from the bluff under trees and had a picnic watching small sailboats plane the choppy water below. A large ferry, resembling a river steamer, lumbered past with flags flying.,After lunch, we turned toward Martindale, an area reportedly little changed since the Wordsworths' day. On either side of the Martindale ridge, the land slopes away to form a secluded valley, each etched by a stream. Taking the way closest to the lake, we soon entered a long corridor between the hills, and I imagined how cut off from the world this valley would be in winter, when one snowfall could close all access. Although remote, this was a working valley; its green hill slopes were dotted with sheep, and we passed through a farmyard where a man and a woman were busy with a wagon. In the distance, a man drove a tractor through high, wheat-colored grass, while his dog bounced excitedly in its rear. The pastoral life is not incidental to the Lake District landscape; the characteristic smooth-cropped slopes of its hulking hills are the work of generations of grazing sheep.,At the head of the valley, we began a steep ascent that brought us to a windy summit, looking down on the small town of Patterdale, with Ullswater's gray water to our right. Patterdale itself seemed closed down, or asleep, as we later tromped through it, hoping to catch the Glenridding ferry back to Howtown. In fact, the last ferry had departed hours earlier. We continued to Howtown by road as I mentally calculated a return trip: I would make the long walk from Patterdale, along the Grisedale River, to Grasmere. This is a trick the Lake District seems to play -- visitors are hooked and immediately start planning for ''the next time.'',Rydal Mount, the last home of both William and Dorothy. Whereas Dove Cottage was the humble abode of a young, struggling poet and his devoted sister, Rydal Mount is the solid manor of England's Poet Laureate. In 1802, William married Dorothy's closest friend, Mary Hutchinson, and the three good friends continued to live at Dove Cottage in almost unimaginable harmony until 1808, when the poet's burgeoning family made it necessary to seek a larger house. The Wordsworths settled at Rydal Mount in 1813, and William and Dorothy lived here until their deaths.,Despite her formidable walks, Dorothy had never enjoyed good health, and in 1829, after a serious illness, she collapsed, never to be herself again, either mentally or physically. Modern medical science suggests that she suffered from a form of Alzheimer's disease that sank her into dementia. Confined to a bed or wheelchair, she quickly lost all semblance of the brave, bright companion of great poets she had once been; most painful for her doting family was the cruel change of temperament that rendered her querulous and foulmouthed. Nonetheless, William and his wife, Mary, nursed her devotedly and tenderly, not from any sense of duty, but from something far more rare -- unqualified love.,Rydal Mount, with its prosperous and well-appointed rooms, is satisfying material evidence that prodigious talent sometimes earns its reward. From the upstairs windows are views of Rydal Water, and from Dorothy's window one can also look down upon the handsome garden laid out by her brother. Tantalizing spells of lucidity penetrated her dementia, one of which occurred at her beloved brother's death in 1850; she was to outlive him by five years.,Inexplicably, her ability to write never entirely disappeared, as an entry written in the spring of 1833, when she was 61 and well into her illness, proves: ''Two glowing anemones and a snow white companion are in a pot on my window ledge, and two knots of primroses of the Alpine purple. Rooks busy all the birds of the sky and earth are singing and all is wrapped in happy brightness.'',At Home With Dorothy and Company,Hotels and bed-and-breakfasts abound in and around Grasmere. The cheerful Hart Head Barn (telephone: 15394-33991), near Rydal Mount, is a converted barn offering three double rooms, one with a shower, for about $30 to $35 a person; breakfast, which might consist of porridge, bacon, scrambled eggs and toast, is included. Open year round. Credit cards not accepted.,How Foot Lodge (15394-35366) is a Victorian country house owned by the Wordsworth Trust, just up the road from Dove Cottage. There are four double rooms and two twin rooms, one with a private sun lounge; all rooms have a bath or shower. Rates start at about $42 a person (except for the room with the lounge, which is about $47 a person); the price includes a Continental or full English breakfast. Open from March to the end of November. Some credit cards accepted.,A more eccentric choice is the Lancrigg Vegetarian Country House Hotel (15394-35317; fax: 15394-35058), once a farmstead, which was purchased by Elizabeth Fletcher, a friend of the Wordsworths, in 1839. It is set in 30 acres of terraced gardens. There are 13 rooms and accommodations for two in a cottage on the grounds. Rates range from about $65 to about $152 a person, including breakfast and a four-course dinner. All meals are vegetarian, and dinner might include eggplant terrine with tarragon cream sauce, fricassee of marinated tofu and wild mushrooms and, for dessert, sticky toffee and date pudding. There is a selection of organic and fruit wines, and unusual beers. The dining room is open to the public, and dinner for two, with wine, costs about $90. Dogs are welcome. Open year round. Credit cards accepted.,In Howtown, on Ullswater Lake, is the friendly and efficient Howtown Hotel (17684-86514), a rambling country house set in gardens on the edge of fields. There are 12 rooms, a couple of them with private baths (others share), and four self-catering cottages. Double rooms start at about $75 a person, with breakfast and dinner included. Specialties of the hotel dining room, which is open to the public, include poached salmon, roast lamb, roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and such traditional English desserts as steamed pudding and trifle. Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $65. Open from the end of March through Nov. 3. Credit cards not accepted.,At all of these establishments, picnic lunches are prepared upon request.,Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum (15394-35544; fax: 15394-35748) are on the same grounds in Grasmere. The museum exhibits the Wordsworth Trust's collection of manuscripts, books and paintings pertaining to William Wordsworth, his family, his friends and his works. The original manuscript of Dorothy's journal is here. Handsome illustrated editions of various Wordsworth books can be bought in the gift shop. The Dove Cottage Tea Rooms (15394-35268), also on the grounds, serve snacks, lunch and dinner; a meal for two is about $16. The cottage and museum are open daily from 9:30 to 5:30, the second week of February through December; closed January and the first week of February. Admission: about $8.,Rydal Mount (15394-33002; fax: 15394-31738), the home of Dorothy, William and his wife, Mary, after 1813, is between Ambelside and Grasmere, with fine views of Lake Windermere. The house, which belongs to descendants of the poet, contains many of the Wordsworths' personal possessions and first editions. Open daily except Tuesday from 10 to 4, November through February, 9:30 to 5, March through October. Admission: about $6.,Wordsworth House (1900-824805; fax: same number), William and Dorothy Wordsworth's childhood home in Cockermouth, about 25 miles from Grasmere, is furnished in the style of the late 18th century. Open from March 29 to Oct. 29, Monday through Friday, all Bank Holiday Saturdays, all Saturdays in June, July and August, 10:30 to 4:30. Admission: about $5.,Walkers in the Lake District should wear stout walking boots and carry a light day pack with a walking guide or map; even though most trails are well marked, the routes are often not straightforward, and clear directions are a necessity. Some kind of waterproof windbreaker should be carried, whatever the season of the year.,Walking guides can be found in most book, gift or hiking shops. I particularly liked ''Walk the Lakes,'' a booklet of maps published by Collins, together with the Collins large-scale walking map. Small site specific guides are also useful.

She said she has applied for clerk-typist jobs and has been rejected becuase she doesn't have enough experience. She attends school Tuesdays through Saturdays from 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. She missed a month when her son was ill. She goes to a required Jobs Group session on Mondays where people in the safety net program get job-search help.,Mrs. Perez said she was looking for a job that would not conflict with school. She said her husband is seeking third-shift employment. They are spreading word about his barber shop by passing out fliers.,Meanwhile, the Perez family is receiving food stamps and state medical coverage. They live in a federally-subsidized New Haven apartment and receive additional rent money from the safety net program.,They get donations of used clothing, but Mrs. Perez said she likes her children to have new underwear. Her husband drives the children and his wife to and from school in a car they own.,Mr. and Mrs. Perez have been married for eight years. Mrs. Perez, a native of Mexico, graduated from Bassick High School in Bridgeport and took her son, Isaac, to day care there. A school nurse, concerned that Isaac was undernourished, helped the Perez family get food stamps and medical assistance for the baby.,After high school, Mrs. Perez took a course to learn to be a clerk-typist. She also attended Housatonic Community College, but didn't finish because she could not afford child care.,Mr. Perez got his high school equivalency diploma, worked in a fabric company, then took a barber training course.,He said he left a job in a New Haven barber shop because he would leave the shop a couple of times each day to take his children from one place to another.",PEGGY MCCARTHY,"FEB. 28, 1999",One Family's Situation,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/one-family-s-situation.html

"Even current maps call the 127 acres in Ewing Township the State of New Jersey Hog Farm. But it is more properly called the Green-Reading farm, and it has been 10 years since hogs were raised there. Now here and at nearby Jones Farm, both operated by the Department of Corrections, prisoners produce dairy products for the prison system.,Built in 1797, the farmhouse, last year became Ewing's most recent addition to the National Register of Historic Places.,Heidi Harendza, Ewing's historic preservation specialist, who wrote the successful proposal for the registry, recently talked about the farm.,Q. What originally interested you in the farmhouse?,A. I've lived in this town all my life. And it's a place I've passed by every day of my life. We were somewhat worried, because the building was beginning to fall into disrepair, and having it registered on state and Federal registers insures certain controls in terms of maintenance. It's also a well-preserved example of Federal-period architecture -- the fanlight over the door, the simple brick facade. Often, with a building this old, you'll find a lot of additions. But here you can still get a clear picture of what this building would have looked like.,Q. Why is the farmhouse important?,A. If you look over the vista, this is really what our town's history was built on until 1900 or 1910: small, little hamlet-type villages, surrounded by farms and acreage. The first suburban development in Ewing Township was initiated in 1892, and it really didn't get going until 1900. So it's only taken 100 years for all the farmland in this township to be sucked up.,Q. Who were the original owners?,A. William E. Green built it. Most of the settler families that moved here, maybe 10 families, came from Long Island. The Greens were one of these families. This is a high-style building in a backwater areA. That speaks to the pretensions of the people who lived here.,If you look at William Green's inventory, he had 7 horses, one yoke of oxen, 7 cows, 35 sheep, as well as hay and farm implements. The actual title of the house was Cherry Grove. That's what the owners called it.,Q. How did the farm change over the years?,A. In 1813, William E. Green had an accident with his horse, where he was dragged to death. His wife, Charity Green, remarried, to Pierson Reading. Charity owned the house until the 1840's, when it was put up for sale. The house entered a period of transition. Then the Knight family purchased it, and farmed it until 1911, when it was bought by the state. That's when it became the State of New Jersey Hog Farm.,Q. Was it difficult to find information about the farm?,A. Anytime you're doing historical research, you never know where you're going to find that piece of information you're looking for. I got a phone call from a woman in Gloucester County, who wanted to learn more about the William E. Green who built this house. And she happened to have several letters, which the Greens had written to people in Gloucester County. And I never would have thought to look in the repositories in Gloucester County.,Q. Did you enjoy the research?,A. Yes. I love buildings, because you can walk into a building and step  back in time. Moreover -- and I found this from doing battlefields -- you don't really know a place until you have walked the ground. This town didn't develop in a vacuum. Where we are today is a function of the past. When you see a 7-Eleven and a gas station on a corner, you know that 150 years ago there used to be a blacksmith's shop. And most of the suburban zones were carved out along the lines of old farmhouses.

"Three college quarterbacks have created a gulf between themselves and the rest at their position. This trio stands alone in the type of smart spirals they toss, whether their passes are on short or long routes, on in or out patterns, on the deep post or on the fly. With a flick of the wrist, even off-balance and on their back foot, they can zing a pass more than 50 yards downfield. Their footwork is light and their release is sharp. They are mobile, accurate passers who do not scramble seeking to run but run looking to throw. They look like leaders. Winners.,A dynamic trio: Tim Couch of Kentucky, Donovan McNabb of Syracuse and Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida. One, two, three. They could go that way in the N.F.L. draft on April 17.,That is the current buzz among draftniks, that for the first time since the 1971 N.F.L. draft, quarterbacks could command the top three spots. In 1971 it was Jim Plunkett to the New England Patriots, Dan Pastorini to the Houston Oilers and Archie Manning to the New Orleans Saints. One, two, three.,This time it could be Couch to Cleveland, McNabb to Philadelphia and Culpepper to Cincinnati. One, two, three.,The talent after this superb trio wanes but might, indeed, produce more gems. Akili Smith from Oregon, Cade McNown from U.C.L.A., Ted White from Howard, Shaun King from Tulane, Brock Huard from Washington, Michael Bishop from Kansas State and Brian Kuklick from Wake Forest hope to surprise. At least two from this group of seven realistically hope to crack the first round. Remember, in the storied quarterback class of 1983 which featured six first-rounders, Dan Marino was the sixth quarterback chosen. Stars at quarterback often are drafted at surprising numbers.,Last season, quarterbacks landed in the top spots: Peyton Manning to Indianapolis and Ryan Leaf to San Diego. One, two in the draft.,This season, three could be the charm.,Couch appears a lock in Cleveland. He is 6 feet 5 inches, 225 pounds. He has the entire package -- size, arm, release -- and most important to Cleveland, Couch took an undermanned Kentucky team and lifted it to long lost heights. Here is a talented player who, under pressure, delivered. Scouts love that.,McNabb and Culpepper are close, almost flip-flop players at No. 2.,''I would hate to be the person and the team making the second decision,'' one N.F.L. general manager said. ''With McNabb and Culpepper, one of these guys is probably going to be very good and the other is going to be great. Which one is which?'',Maybe McNabb is the great one.,The thinking can go that Culpepper has played in a pro offense at Central Florida and has already shown plenty of his potential. He is a daunting 6-4, 250 pounds. Huge yet mobile with wondrous feet and arm. McNabb, however, played in a system at Syracuse that did not always feature pure pro-style passing and, thus, his upscale is seen as greater. Just how far can he go? He has it all -- big arm, accurate passing, mobility.,Maybe Culpepper is the great one.,Some scouts believe Culpepper is the favorite over McNabb because his experience at quarterback has been more pro-like. McNabb, they say, may never catch up.,Couch and Culpepper did not perform in passing and running workouts at the N.F.L. scouting combine held recently in Indianapolis. But McNabb did.,He was easily the star quarterback. He left many observers agape, similar to the way he did in his Senior Bowl performance. McNabb is 6-2, 225 pounds. He is not quite as big as Couch and Culpepper, but he is faster. McNabb earned respect for his willingness to participate fully at Indianapolis.,All three will hold private workouts for N.F.L. teams beginning next week. Among the best of the rest are Smith, who has a cannon-like arm, and McNown, who scouts call magical because although he is only 6 feet he plays and produces in a much bigger way.,This draft, however, starts with Couch. And McNabb and Culpepper could quickly follow. Three for the money. Three for the show.",THOMAS GEORGE,"FEB. 28, 1999","ON PRO FOOTBALL; Hut 1, Hut 2, Hut 3: Draft Is a Snap for a Dynamic Trio of Quarterbacks",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/pro-football-hut-1-hut-2-hut-3-draft-snap-for-dynamic-trio-quarterbacks.html
"Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco?,The decision by  Senator Frank R. Lautenberg to retire after his term expires next year not only shakes up the political landscape for next year's Senate race but also changes the dynamics for the governor's election in 2001.,''Senator Lautenberg's decision changes everything,'' said Thomas P. Giblin, chairman of the state Democratic Party. ''All of these races are intertwined.'',While much of the political talk around the state has focused on the long list of possible Senate candidates that includes Governor Whitman and former Gov. Jim Florio, the possible ascension of Mr. DiFrancesco is preoccupying most people here at the State House.,Governor Whitman, who is limited to two terms as governor, is under heavy pressure from state and national Republican leaders to run for the Senate next year. She promises to make a final decision within the next couple of months.,Mrs. Whitman said that she would not give up her role as governor if she became a candidate. But if she won, she would be turning over the final year of her second term to Mr. DiFrancesco, now the Senate President. Under the New Jersey constitution, the state does not have a lieutenant governor.,In fact, Mr. DiFrancesco, a Republican from Scotch Plains, might find himself holding both jobs -- Senate President and acting Governor -- which could give him a leg up on his ambitions to become elected governor in November.,''It means that he has a tremendous advantage in two ways,'' said Cliff Zukin, a professor at Rutgers University who directs the Eagleton Poll. ''It allows him to build name recognition, which is extremely difficult to do in New Jersey bcause we only have the one statewide office. And it really helps in terms of his base.'',It is unlikely that Mr. DiFrancesco, a lawyer who first came to Trenton in 1976 after winning election to the General Assembly, would have to worry about a primary battle once he became acting Governor. And he would probably have an easier time raising money.,Considering how competitive recent contests for the Governor's mansion have been, Mr. DiFrancesco would still have to fight hard to hold onto the job.,For instance, James E. McGreevey, the Democratic mayor of Woodbridge who nearly toppled Mrs. Whitman in 1997, is already gearing up for a campaign. He dismisses concerns from his fellow Democrats, who say that Mr. DiFrancesco -- prematurely ensconced in the Governor's seat -- might hamper his efforts. ''In the last election we were able to mount an effective campaign against a four-year incumbent,'' he said.,But the record shows that New Jersey voters rarely toss out incumbent governors, so Mr. DiFrancesco would certainly have an easier time than if he were running as Senate President -- that is, as long as the economy continued to hum and he handled himself well.,In an interview last week, Mr. DiFrancesco, a moderate Republican, played down any possible advantages that the job of acting Governor might have on his ambitions to become governor. ''I don't know if it means anything at this point,'' he said.,He also noted that taking over as acting Governor would have its disadvantages as well as its advantages.,''It would definitely have its ups and downs,'' Mr. DiFrancesco said as he sat behind his heavy mahogany desk on the second floor of the State House. ''You are inheriting an administration. There are going to be a lot of hard choices to be made in a very short amount of time.'',What could New Jerseyans expect from Mr. DiFrancesco as acting Governor?,Like Mrs. Whitman, he considers himself a conservative on fiscal management but more moderate on social issues. For example, he has been behind several tax-cutting efforts in recent years, and supported the legislation that restored an income tax deduction for a portion of a homeowner's property taxes. At the same time, he has long supported abortion rights.,Over the years, he has developed a record that supporters and opponents will likely mine for campaign fodder. Among the major laws that he has sponsored are the state's family leave act, the creation of a catastrophic relief fund for families with seriously ill children, the state's lemon law, which protects purchasers of defective automobiles, and the $300 million dredging and economic development bond act.,As a legislative leader in his fourth term as Senate President, he describes himself as a consensus-builder, which can sometimes annoy  members of the Assembly and those in the Governor's office when they just want a piece of legislation passed. He is not one to necessarily demand a fellow Senator's vote except when he really needs it.,As Senate President and acting Governor, he would be controlling two-thirds of the state's governing apparatus. But he insists that wielding such power ''would not change my style.'',''I'm not afraid to involve a number of people in the decision-making process,'' he said. ''We benefit from as much input as possible.''",JENNIFER PRESTON,"FEB. 28, 1999",ON POLITICS; All Eyes Are on Senate Race Except Those of DiFrancesco,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/on-politics-all-eyes-are-on-senate-race-except-those-of-difrancesco.html
"Adding to the crescendo of outrage and disappointment among many New York City police officers, state and city officials yesterday condemned a $660,000 Federal jury award to a man convicted of killing a rookie officer in Queens 11 years ago.,The inmate, David McClary, 33, who is serving a 25 years-to-life sentence for the 1988 slaying of Officer Edward Byrne in Jamaica, Queens, spent four years in solitary confinement, from November 1989 to March 1994. On Tuesday, a jury in Rochester found Mr. McClary had suffered mental distress during the time that prison officials kept him locked in a tiny cell and that his civil rights had been violated.,In Albany, Jim Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services who responded to calls to Gov. George E. Pataki, denounced the jury's decision.,''Certainly, we do not believe that a cop killer should be getting $660,000 of the taxpayers dollars,'' said Mr. Flateau. Referring to the state's Corrections Commissioner, Glenn S. Goord, he added: ''We feel that is wrong. That's not just the Commissioner's position, that's also the Governor's position.'',Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was in Florida yesterday, said Mr. Giuliani condemned the jury's ruling. ''The Mayor believes this is an absurd verdict and a miscarriage of justice,'' Mr. Higgins said.,The condemnation has not been unanimous, however. Tom Terrizzi, the associate director of Prisoners Legal Services of New York, which helped Mr. McClary file his case, has defended the verdict as fair recompense for the debilitating psychological effects of Mr. McClary's forced isolation.,Mr. McClary was convicted of shooting Officer Byrne, 22, in the head several times at close range as he sat in a parked patrol car on a South Jamaica street in the early morning of Feb. 26, 1988. The officer was guarding the firebombed home of a man who had complained to the police about drug dealers in his neighborhood. Mr. McClary was one of four members of a drug gang that, on orders from its boss, Howard (Pappy) Mason, killed officer Byrne.,Scott Brown, a spokesman for State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, who is responsible for defending state agencies against lawsuits such as the one Mr. McClary filed against the Corrections Department, said Mr. Spitzer is planning to ask the judge in the case to overturn the verdict.,At the time of the shooting, crack cocaine was ravaging New York City's poorer neighborhoods like those Officer Byrne patrolled at night. As a result, thousands of criminals flowed into state and Federal prisons, said Mr. Flateau. And that forced corrections officials to place Mr. McClary in what officials call ''administrative segregation,'' or  solitary confinement, to protect him from other prisoners, Mr. Flateau said.,''Our first concern was that he might not be too popular with the prisoners,'' he said. ''Our second concern was that someone might want to have taken him out -- killed him -- because they thought it might have put them in good stead for taking out a cop killer.'',Also, shortly after he went to prison, Mr. McClary was being considered as a possible witness against one of the other gang members who shot Officer Byrne, said a state law enforcement official familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity.,Officer Byrne, who lived in Massapequa, in Nassau County, grew up in a police family. His father, Matthew Byrne, now a lawyer, is a retired New York City Police lieutenant. The elder Mr. Byrne and other family members did not respond yesterday to telephone calls seeking comment on the jury award.,If they chose, Officer Byrne's relatives could seek to deny Mr. McClary the $660,000 award through a wrongful-death or personal injury suit in civil court, legal experts said. Though the statute of limitations on the state's wrongful-death statutes is eight years, family members could  bring a case based on laws that prevent convicts from unjust enrichment related to their crimes, said Conrad Johnson, a law professor Columbia University School of Law.,As word of the decision to award Mr. McClary $660,000 in damages spread, police officials expressed bewilderment.,James Savage, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the jury's verdict was the talk of the annual Emerald Society dinner Friday in Great Neck, N.Y., attended by more than 1,000 police officers.,''It was on the lips of just about everybody I spoke to, the disbelief and the disappointment,'' he said. At the 103d Precinct station house in Jamaica, where the street out front was renamed Police Officer Edward Byrne Avenue, the verdict carried a particular sting.,''It's disgusting and ridiculous,'' said one precinct detective who refused to give his name. ''Anybody you talk to here is going to say the same thing. It's a liberal country and liberal judge, what can I say?''",PAUL ZIELBAUER,"FEB. 28, 1999",Officials Condemn Award By Jury to Officer's Killer,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/officials-condemn-award-by-jury-to-officer-s-killer.html
"One morning in December, David Henderson, an off-duty Camden policeman, found a parking ticket on his car windshield. That summons now threatens the collection of fines for failing to feed most of the state's 50,000 street parking meters.,''I had to look at it for a while to figure out what it was,'' Mr. Henderson recalled in a telephone interview last week. ''I never got a parking ticket for not feeding a meter before. This was my first.'',Mr. Henderson, 42, of Haddon Township, had been visiting his lawyer in Haddonfield and left his car in a metered space only after he made sure the meter was showing ''more than an hour of time, which was more than enough for me to get in, get out and be on my way.'',But, he said, the time had run out faster than he had expected. He checked his watch and saw he was still within the hour he thought he had coming to him.,''I was looking for some kind of sticker that said the meter had been inspected and was in good working order, and there wasn't any,'' he said. ''When I was working as a summer policeman in Wildwood, they had a big problem with signs and meters that hadn't been inspected. That's when I learned about Title 51.'',Title 51, state regulations formulated in 1911 and redefined in 1994, requires that state Department of Weights and Measures must each year inspect and certify the accuracy of all ''commercial measuring devices,'' which includes municipal parking meters.,Mr. Henderson then spoke to Patricia Tuck-Davis, director of the Camden County Department of Weights and Measures. ''She said she didn't know when the the meters in Haddonfield had been inspected, or if they'd ever been inspected,'' he said.,Mr. Henderson said he had paid the $7 fine ''under duress'' this month.,''I don't see how a municipality can write tickets on a meter if they can't show that the meters are accurate,'' he said. ''And I can't believe I'm the only one who's bothered to bring this up.'',Neither could Ms. Tuck-Davis, who said she had requested clarification from the state Division of Weights and Measures as soon as Mr. Henderson had notified her in December. That clarification has yet to arrive, she said.,Until then, she said, her four inspectors will periodically inspect meters in Camden County when complaints are made.,''But inspect all of them every year? In the five years I've been in this office, nobody ever asked us to do that, and besides, we don't have the manpower,'' Ms. Tuck-Davis said. ''Paying for more staff to inspect every one of them would not be economically unfeasible.'',But Mark Herr, director of the state Division of Weights and Measures in Newark, said Ms. Tuck-Davis was not likely to hear from the state.,Title 51 ''applies to all commercial weighing and measuring devices, but not to devices used in law enforcement,'' Mr. Herr said. ''We inspect and calibrate radar guns, and we can also do meters, for a fee, if we're asked.'',Mr. Herr said he could not remember the last time his office had been asked to inspect municipal parking meters.",BILL KENT,"FEB. 28, 1999",Officer Wants State to Pay For Faulty Parking Meters,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/officer-wants-state-to-pay-for-faulty-parking-meters.html
"Nearly 27 years after the police say a bookmaker shot an acquaintance dead at a Brooklyn bar and then vanished, a police detective handing out sketches of the suspect happened upon him Friday on a midtown Manhattan street.,The suspect, Joseph Carfagno, 72, a bookmaker and convicted rapist, was arrested in the April 23, 1972, killing of Joseph Destefano, 35, after an argument outside the Graham Lounge in Williamsburg, said Detective John Krol of the 94th Precinct in Brooklyn. Charges have not yet been filed.,The detective, who is on desk duty because of an illness, had taken it on himself to research unsolved cases. He said he had gone to West 49th Street on Friday to pass out digitally updated sketches of the suspect near a hotel where Mr. Carfagno had once worked at as a clerk and had long been known as a bookmaker.,But before the detective and his partner even parked, Mr. Carfagno appeared, standing in front of a parking garage at 225 West 49th Street. Detective Krol said he recognized the man's distinctive webbed fingers.,''He didn't know what we were doing because we weren't even wearing suits and were driving my Ford Escort,'' the detective said. ''I think he just figured we were going into the garage to check prices.'',''He didn't know until we pulled out our badges,'' he added. ''But when we nudged his left hand out of his pocket and saw the unusual web formation around the fingers, we knew it was him.'',According to press accounts, Mr. Carfagno was nearly arrested in 1976, when the police received anonymous tips that he was living in a Manhattan hotel. But he vanished before the detectives arrived.,He had been well known to the police before the shooting at the Graham Lounge.,Beginning in 1952, he spent nearly eight years in prison on rape charges, the police said. In 1960 he was implicated in, but never indicted in, a shooting into a Brooklyn bar. Two men were believed to have cracked open the bar's front door, then one stuck an automatic pistol through the opening and sprayed four shots at the patrons inside, the police said. No one was injured.,Seven years later, Mr. Carfagno was convicted of operating a policy numbers game, the police said.,Asked if the suspect was still a bookmaker, Detective Krol said, ''I couldn't say yes and I couldn't say no, but we vouched for safe keeping $7,408 we found on him.''",KIT R.

"THE HOUDINI GIRL,By Martyn Bedford.,310 pp. New York:,Pantheon Books. $24.,I PICKED up ''The Houdini Girl,'' the English author Martyn Bedford's second novel, with a certain wariness -- and not only because of the pitfalls that traditionally await a debutant's encore. Bedford's previous book, ''Acts of Revision,'' won the Yorkshire Post First Novel Award, which is only mildly encouraging news. These days, British fiction is a bonfire kept aflame largely by fresh Scottish and Irish timber. The English novel, despite the fondness with which many American readers still approach it, is going through one of its soggiest patches since the early 19th century.,Happily, Martyn Bedford is the genuine article, a writer of unmistakable flair and accomplishment. An original voice he is not -- or not yet -- but he tells a cracking tale, and ''The Houdini Girl'' is packed with brisk repartee, evidently Bedford's specialty. First and foremost, though, ''The Houdini Girl'' is a page turner, a suspenseful hunt for the truth about a young woman's carefully hidden past. The woman in question, 25-year-old Rosa Kelly from Killarney, County Kerry, has died mysteriously, falling off a train, perhaps pushed. The quest to resolve the mystery takes the narrator -- Rosa's bereaved English lover -- from his peaceful home in Oxford to the less charming alleyways of Amsterdam.,What lends ironic perspective to the chase is the fact that Bedford's narrator, Fletcher Brandon (nicknamed Red), is an expert in disappearing acts. He's a magician by profession, an illusionist. As Red peels away layer after layer of his illusions about Rosa, with whom he has lived for one sexy, combative, freewheeling year, he keeps finding that the truth about her resembles one of his painstakingly constructed stage tricks. Open the box and -- gasp! -- there's no one there. Like an onion, Rosa is all skins.,''The Houdini Girl'' offers the reader a time-honored but inexhaustible scenario, the psychological profile as detective story, and works it with consummate skill. The Rosa Kelly we and Red encounter, as he takes us back to the beginning of their relationship, is a typical punk. Aggressive, defiantly unimpressed by Red's sleight-of-hand flirting in an Oxford pub, she nonetheless takes the initiative and moves in with him after a single night of soaring passion. ''I've heard it said,'' Red tells us, ''that when two lovers meet for the first time they have a subliminal premonition of what it is between them that will, ultimately, cause their division. With Rosa, I sensed from the outset it would be sex. She was so sexual, I couldn't believe I'd be enough for her.'',Rosa won't talk about her past. On weekdays, she commutes from Red's apartment in Oxford to London, telling him she works for an Irish newspaper. This is the first lie that Red discovers after Rosa's sudden demise. Her boss tells him she only worked part time for the paper; on Thursdays and Fridays, no one knows what she did or where she went. Was she with the I.R.A.? It's our first suspicion, and Red's, and that of the police investigators.,It turns out that Rosa was on her way from Oxford to Reading, intending to travel on to Amsterdam, when two men ambushed her between train compartments and scared -- if not actually pushed -- her to her death. One of the men, caught on the railway-station security videotape as he boarded the train, turns up again in Red's house as a burglar. Soon enough, his partner is arrested -- and names Red as the man who paid them to commit the murder.,Red's professional skills and resourcefulness are about to be tested. Despite having his passport confiscated, he contrives to slip out of the country and into Amsterdam, where answers surely await. His one ally in the Netherlands is the book's most endearing character, Denis Huting, an obese gay magician whose tender appreciation of his fellow man is matched only by his enthusiasm for Dutch food. Together, Red and Denis breach the sleazy surface of Amsterdam's red-light district to conjure with the horror beneath. In recent years, plenty of tourists have experienced the violence engendered by Amsterdam's savage drugs-and-sex wars, but the increased number of muggings and the city's rising ill fame still haven't entirely dented its image as a carnival town, Europe's permanently merry and amoral feast of fools. Fortunately, Bedford knows better. His depiction of Amsterdam is the best thing about ''The Houdini Girl,'' and the writing in these passages is several notches above the novel's otherwise serviceable prose:,''If you stared at the graffiti long enough,'' Red observes, wandering through the labyrinth of the red-light district, ''you began to unravel words from the gore of incoherence. From the Cyrillic script of spray paint, from the very colors. And the words that were words -- the names, slogans, messages -- became mere shapes, merging into meaninglessness. Hieroglyphics on the once white door to No. 37. And the walls, daubed. Stained and flaking and mottled with urban rash; strung as before with slung bicycles on posts and pipes. The litter. The disproportionate angles of the roofs of buildings of ill-matched height, like men and women and stooped old folk standing in two lines so you were a child between them, looking up at a template of asymmetrical blue sky that revolved, when you did.'',THE outcome of Red's quest will not disappoint. ''The Houdini Girl'' is masterfully choreographed, albeit sometimes too neatly, since Bedford can't resist drawing and redrawing the parallels between his narrator's professional prowess, his stage legerdemain, and the way the tables have been turned on him by a partner even more skillful at covering her tracks than he is. (Misdirection, he reminds us early on, is ''the most important skill in a magician's repertoire.''),''The Houdini Girl'' is a very clever, very tidy novel. Unfortunately, tidiness -- admittedly essential in a stage magician -- is not a primary virtue in a novelist. Even if Sterne was exaggerating when he insisted that digression was the heart of the genre, it's possible to be too clean an act for your own good. Nonetheless, the sheer suspense of Bedford's book -- coupled with its unusually deft and witty dialogue -- makes it memorable. With great aplomb, he has brought off an erotic thriller; for his next trick, a strategic loss of control might not come amiss.",CAREY HARRISON,"FEB. 28, 1999","Now You See Her, Now . . .",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/now-you-see-her-now.html
"When my family and I planned an overland journey to Ladakh last summer, it seemed like the ideal conclusion to our assignment in India, where I had spent nearly five years as the South Asia correspondent of The New York Times. Our aim was to round out our travels with a trip so ambitious and compelling that it would ease the wrench of leaving a country that had entwined our hearts.,The plan was to make a two-week, 2,500-mile round-trip road journey northward from New Delhi -- first, across the north Indian plain to the foothills of the Himalayas, then up the deep valleys and over the mountains to Ladakh, a part of ancient Tibet that became a northern outpost of India when it was annexed by Britain in the mid-19th century. Along the way, we would cross several of the world's highest-altitude road passes, one of them at nearly 18,000 feet, close to the height of the base camp used by mountaineers planning ascents of Mount Everest.,In Ladakh, we would explore a territory that has been Buddhist since the third century B.C., and of special significance to Tibetan Buddhists for the past 40 years, when it became a safe redoubt for many of those fleeing the Chinese Communist brutalization of Tibet. For fun, we would camp in the mountains; shoot the headwaters of the Indus on a raft; browse the Tibetan markets in Leh, Ladakh's capital, and mingle with the Western back-packers who have trekked to Ladakh since India opened overland routes to foreigners in 1989.,I had traveled previously to Leh to interview the Dalai Lama, who has spent part of many summers visiting Ladakh since he left Tibet in 1959 to begin his exile in India. But I made that journey by air, gazing down from 30,000 feet as the Indian Airlines plane flew across the narrowing triangle of Indian territory that lies beyond Simla, the old British retreat in the Himalayan foothills north of New Delhi, which is a staging post for travels into what ancient Indians knew as ''the land beyond the mountains.'',We had, I thought, all we needed for the trip: A Japanese-made four-wheel-drive vehicle, an Isuzu Trooper; plenty of experience of the vicissitudes of driving in rural India, and a family mature enough to handle any trials the journey might bring. Our children, Jamie, 17, and Emily, 15, had traveled with us to assignments in Russia, China and Canada, before India, and would be home for our last weeks in India from their boarding schools in England. Jamie's girlfriend, Sarah, 16, the daughter of a New Delhi-based diplomat, had also volunteered to come along.,An added challenge came from making the trip in August, in the middle of the north Indian monsoon, when swollen rivers in the Himalayas burst their banks and landslides carry away entire villages in the regions we would cross. Once into Ladakh, though, with valley floors at 10,000 feet, we would be in the one part of India where we could escape the rains and the stifling humidity. Guidebooks promised us 75-degree days and cloudless skies.,A few nagging counterpoints came from Jane, my wife, whose innate skepticism has restrained many a harebrained scheme. ''Do you know any foreigner who has driven over those passes?'' she asked. ''And how will we fix the vehicle if anything goes wrong?'' Finally, a query inspired by Jane's lifelong passion for smoking: ''How do you suppose I'll cope at 18,000 feet?'',Any road journey in India begins against imposing odds: An official death toll of 65,000 a year almost certainly understates the losses in a country where record-keeping, even of road deaths, is haphazard. Statisticians have calculated that a fatal road accident is somewhere between 15 and 20 times more likely in India than in the United States, and we knew that medical help on the passes we planned to cross would be rudimentary to nonexistent.,We had driven shorter distances outside New Delhi many times, experiencing the kamikaze conditions. No journey, however short, had been free of mangled wrecks, mostly of trucks and buses that had collided in a never-ending struggle for possession of narrow, potholed, impossibly overcrowded roads. We knew, too, that many Indians subscribe to the karma school of driving. This holds that it is not crazed driving that kills you, it is an individual's karma, or destiny -- a concept that has the effect of diminishing any sense of personal accountability in drivers.,We trusted less to providence. Before we set off, we insured that the Trooper had heavy ''bullbars'' for added protection in front, imported radial tires for better road holding -- and new brake disks. For added assurance, we took on the services of an experienced guide, Shaukat Singh Sikand, who had accompanied other expatriates in New Delhi on overland journeys to Ladakh. A wiry, 38-year-old Sikh, Shockey, as he calls himself, or The Shocker, as we affectionately nicknamed him once our journey began to go awry, is the son of a highly decorated fighter pilot. With that pedigree, we reasoned, Shockey would be the ideal companion for the trip.,The journey north went well enough. With Shockey driving ahead to Simla in his Maruti Gypsy, a lightweight Indian jeep, to prepare our onward journey into the mountains, we made our first nightfall at the Glasshouse. This comfortable wood-and-glass hotel on the banks of the Ganges in the Himalayan foothills is an hour's drive beyond Haridwar, one of the holy cities on India's holiest river. There, we had paused to chat with the saffron-robed saddhus, or holy men, who gather along the river's banks, offering blessings in return for alms.,Our second day brought us a foretaste of the travails ahead. Skirting the Himalayan foothills, we tore a tire to shreds on an iron spike that road builders had left in the road. After we had struggled fruitlessly with the jack and the Trooper's spare wheel for about 15 minutes, things took an ugly turn with the arrival of a village woman, and soon afterward a group of sullen-eyed village men, demanding money. When we demurred, the men began circling ominously around the mountain of baggage, camping gear and food we had unloaded.,Just then, a passing vehicle stopped. The driver, a powerfully built Sikh, told us he was visiting from his adopted home in Australia. In heavy rain, he rolled up his sleeves, borrowed a jack from a passing minibus and replaced the tire; as he worked, the disconsolate villagers melted away. When we thanked our new friend, he shook his head. ''People were kind to me when I arrived in Australia,'' he said. ''I like to take any chance I have to repay.'',While new tires were forwarded from New Delhi, we paused in the plush comfort of Simla's Oberoi Cecil Hotel, savoring the fading elegance of a town that was once the summer retreat for Britain's viceroys. Then we set off again, running up the Kullu Valley to Manali, at the foot of the passes to Ladakh. The landscape was as impressive as anything we'd seen in India, with a mix of vegetation -- bamboo glades side by side with pine forests -- that seemed a metaphor for the semitropical region we were leaving and the mountains ahead.,Next day, with Jane driving, we headed up through thick mists onto the narrow, switchback road that runs more than 250 miles across the mountains into Ladakh. Ahead lay a succession of imposing passes, beginning with the 13,078-foot Rohtang, above Manali, and ending with the 17,582-foot Tanglang-la, said to be, after another pass near the Tibetan border, the second-highest drivable pass in the world.,The road from Manali to Leh, one of only two into Ladakh -- the other runs between between Leh and Srinagar, the Kashmiri city to the west -- was built by the Indian Army in the 1980's as a supply route for forces defending Ladakh's eastern frontier with China and its northern frontier with Pakistan. After four wars pitting India against its neighbors, one with China in 1962 and three with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971, Ladakh has become once more what it was in the 19th century, a cockpit of confrontation. Its borders with both Pakistan and China bristle with opposing forces, including some, on the Siachen Glacier north of Leh (contested by India and Pakistan) that, at 21,000 feet, represent the world's highest battlefields.,Winter snows close the passes from September to July, leaving only three summer months for the passage of supplies needed to sustain 150,000 Ladakhis and at least as many Indian troops.,Fifteen years after its completion, the road remains, in large sections, little better than a cattle track -- unpaved for dozens of miles on end, frequently too narrow to allow more than a single vehicle to pass, with bridges and culverts that are poorly constructed and liable to crumble away at any time. On the downhill side of the road, where the soft edge can subside without warning, there are sheer drops 1,500 feet or more to the river valleys below, and no walls or guardrails,Much of the traffic consists of trucks and buses, many of them driven in roller-derby mode. In an effort to calm matters down, the Indian Army has erected a series of warnings, but since these are in English, while most of the truck drivers speak only Hindi (and are illiterate,in any case), they have little effect. We liked, especially, ''Be Gentle on My Curves'' and ''Better to be Mister Late than the Late Mister.'',As we crossed the Baralacha-la, a 16,010-foot pass that follows the Rohtang River, we stopped for a picnic at a spot overlooking the wreckage of a fuel tanker that had rolled down the mountain. From the log at an Indian Army checkpoint nearby, we learned that five men died in the crash, two of them Israeli backpackers riding on the top of the tanker, and that the five were among 15 people who died on the Baralacha-la in the previous week.,Then there was the altitude. We had taken altitude-sickness pills before reaching the passes, but when we reached the top of the Tanglang-la, after camping at 15,500 feet, Jane was seized with a pounding headache and severe shortness of breath, Sarah was wracked with nausea and Emily had fallen unusually quiet. At this point, from the driver's seat, I had a growing sense of affinity with Lord Cardigan, the hapless commander who in the 1850's led the Light Brigade ''into the valley of death'' in the Crimea.,Shockey, driving blithely ahead, was deep in Jane's personal doghouse. At our first overnight camping stop, his promised ''American portaloo'' proved to be four poles wrapped with a burlap sheet that left a gaping space 30 inches above the ground, made decent -- in Shockey's view, at any rate -- by being erected 300 yards out into what amounted to a desert. His ''full-course'' dinner turned out to be beans on toast. And now, at a height where only aircraft fly, the ''bottled oxygen'' he had pledged to carry with him turned out to be wholly theoretical. At this point, he ceased to be Shockey, at least to the disconsolate Jane, and became The Shocker.,As we descended the Tanglang-la, the weather was superb, just as the guidebooks promised. The first Ladakhi village we came to, a cluster of flat-roofed houses built of mud and straw, was set in a typical Ladakhi moonscape, brown and ocher mountainsides bare of vegetation. But the village itself was aflame with color -- the green of ripening crops, the turquoise water and foamy whitecaps of a rushing river, the reds and yellows worn by Buddhist monks ambling home toward a nearby monastery. In the glow of a setting sun, groups of women and girls were at work harvesting in the fields. Others waved cheerfully from their houses, many of them dressed in the traditional finery visible everywhere in Ladakh -- high felt hats, richly embroidered red shawls, heavy necklaces of silver and turquoise and coral -- and with long, thick tresses plaited to their waists.,By dusk, we were comfortably installed in the Shambala Hotel on the outskirts of Leh, a city that seemed more like an overgrown village, sprawling flat-roofed across an ancient moraine that fills a space between two craggy mountains. The younger members of our party headed forthwith for the Tibetan markets and backpackers' hangouts in the cafes and restaurants that cluster in the lee of the ancient royal palace that dominates the town.,Jamie, Sarah and Emily were in teen-age heaven, save for a curious social pretentiousness they sensed among the backpackers. ''They have their own hierarchy, and we aren't even on the ladder,'' Jamie said. ''I don't have a beard, I don't have an earring and my boots aren't scuffed from trekking across the mountains, so I'm squat.'',But the sense of exclusion didn't stop our three from joining in the avid bouts of shopping in the markets, for Tibetan jewelry and shawls and other gewgaws. And the monasteries around Leh provided endless fascination. Ladakh has at least 100 active monasteries, with perhaps 15,000 monks and novices; hardly any town or village of any size is without one. Along with the snow-capped mountains, they provide Ladakh's dominant sights, most of them perched on cliffs and crags, the most ancient of them ruins that appear to grow from the rock.,Several of the best-known gompas, or monasteries, are close to Leh, including the Shey and Tikse monasteries that lie within a half-hour's drive south of the city. Our favorite was the Spituk monastery, improbably situated above the airport at Leh. While Spituk lacks the grandeur of better-known monasteries, with their candlelighted libraries of Tibetan scrolls and giant statues of the Buddha, it has an engaging informality. Twice, we drove up to the monastery for evening prayers, sitting cross-legged in a pillared hall while rows of wizened monks intoned their prayers, struck their gongs and sipped from tiny cups of a yak's-milk tea.,At regular intervals, their cups, and ours, were filled by a novice of 8 or 9, lugging a pewter kettle at least half his own size. As best we could divine it, the essence of Tibetan Buddhism resides in a sense of the insubstantiality of all material things, but we were relieved to find that the friendly monks of Spituk were not unapproachable ascetics. On the contrary, several appeared intensely worldly, watching us as closely as we watched them, scratching and shifting and snorting as they worked their way through their chants, one of them even winking at us -- or so we thought -- at each striking of the gong. We noticed, too, that the monks were eagle-eyed when it came to taking money for the tickets needed to enter the monasteries, and bold in soliciting donations.,We ended our stay in Leh with a visit to the city's polo field and a half-day's rafting on the fast-flowing, chilly waters of the Indus. The polo was hilarious, played in a bare-earth stadium at the upper end of town by teams of Indian soldiers and Ladakhi civilians with no regard for any polo rules I'd ever heard. ''Free polo,'' one of the Ladakhis called it, after he and an opposing player had ridden their scrawny ponies full-tilt into the bleachers behind one set of goal posts, sending spectators running for their lives.,The rafting proved almost as rule free. In New Delhi, The Shocker had promised us an American-made raft, life jackets and helmets, and in this, at least, he was as good as his word, even if the ancient craft and battered life-jackets he unlimbered from his jeep looked as though they might have begun their working lives on the Colorado about the time that Wild Bill Hickok was raising hell in the West.,Jane took one look and begged off, but the rest of us, with The Shocker at the rear of the raft, imploring the Sikh gods when all seemed lost, went barreling 30 miles down the Indus, plunging into towering waves, passing within inches of rocky overhangs and shooting down rapids as if there were no tomorrow. We loved every soaking second of it, especially when Jane met us at the confluence of the Indus and the Zanskar with the kind of lavish picnic that The Shocker, God bless him, had only been able to summon up in his fevered imagination.,We had planned to return to New Delhi by driving west from Leh to Srinagar, in the Muslim heartland of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, of which Ladakh forms the eastern extremity. But the aftermath of the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan earlier in the summer was still reverberating in heightened tensions between the two countries, and regular exchanges of artillery fire across the front line between the two armies at Kargil, midway between Leh and Srinagar, some of them killing passing truck drivers, had closed the road. This left no alternative to retracing our route over the passes back to Manali, a daunting enough prospect even before things began to go seriously wrong.,Even when they did, the problem came not from the cause we feared, the altitude on the passes, nor even from the madcap Indian driving, but from something closer to home, our Isuzu Trooper, hitherto the cynosure of every Indian truck and bus driver on the road. Later, we realized how lucky we had been to have the vehicle break down on us on the last of the passes before Manali, and not earlier, when we could have been stranded, impossibly, at somewhere close to 18,000 feet. As it was, the shuddering of the clutch as we descended the Rohtang at dusk on our second day out of Leh, followed by its complete failure, presented a seemingly impossible dilemma.,We made nightfall, just, at the Span resort near Manali, but after that it became distressingly clear that the Trooper was not going another foot. Calls on my satellite telephone to New Delhi, London and Tokyo, and inquiries at a local garage, determined that there were no new clutch plates available within 5,000 miles, and that even if we could somehow get the new parts to Manali, no mechanic in the Indian Himalayas had the necessary expertise or the equipment.,This left two options: Loading the Trooper on an Indian truck for the 500-mile journey to New Delhi, or towing it home. Fearful of a truck toppling on the narrow roads and passes still ahead, we took a family vote and settled on towing, aided by a second vehicle, an Indian-made Tata Sumo that we recruited in Manali, that helped to push from behind, against our spare wheel, while The Shocker pulled from in front. After a night of gloomy prognostications in Manali, we soon discovered that what looked like a nightmare -- 500 miles of being towed on Indian roads, a situation rendering us inert in the face of every driving outrage -- turned out to be the moment when an interesting journey turned into one that cemented our affections for India forever.,To begin with, there were The Shocker's heroics -- a veritable David-and-Goliath performance, his Gypsy with its motorcycle-sized engine outweighed a ton or two by our Trooper and its load. For five days, and much of five nights, at speeds that rarely exceeded 10 miles an hour, up passes that tested the Gypsy and its Japanese engine to the limit, The Shocker threaded his way, and ours, through the traffic madness. Not once did he complain, nor did he ever seek any guarantee of compensation for his own vehicle, his most valued possession, in case of disaster. ''Never worry,'' he said, again and again, ''I'll get you home.'',But if The Shocker earned his stripes, the journey ended with still less- likely heroes: Indian truckers. As long as we were driving along in shiny, air-conditioned opulence, they were rarely our friends. But as underdogs, sitting forlornly at the end of a fraying towrope, we seemed to engage their better nature. At the worst moments, on steep, muddy inclines, with sheer drops to oblivion off the roadside, we found ourselves looking up at grinning drivers, thumbs raised, pulling over to make space, shouting encouragements, ever-ready to assist when the towrope snagged or snapped, pushing us up impossible slopes, or lifting us out of crater-sized potholes.,When we finally made it back to New Delhi, exhausted and dirty, but with the Trooper intact, we headed straight for the bar in the Oberoi Hotel, where our first toast was to the truckers of India, all 10 million of them, hardly a one earning more than $2 or $3 a day. But the most enduring epitaph came from Sarah. In the bar, I apologized for involving her in a ''holiday from hell.'' She laughed. ''Not at all,'' she said, grinning from ear to ear. ''I'll always think of it as the Indian fun run.''",JOHN F. BURNS,"FEB. 28, 1999","North to Ladakh, on a High-Altitude Adventure",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/north-to-ladakh-on-a-high-altitude-adventure.html
"WHILE most of Fairfield County was still asleep on a recent Sunday morning, Kathy Setian was rocketing along the ice -- and occasionally banging into other players -- at the Stamford Twin Rinks skating center in a spirited hockey game between the Stamford Storm and the Fighting Saints from South Windsor.,The game had started at 6:30 A.M., which meant that Mrs. Setian had to get up at 5:30 while her husband, Frank, and their four children -- three of them hockey-playing boys -- were still asleep. But that was nothing compared with the 4 A.M. wake-up call for members of the Fighting Saints, who had to get up at that early hour before making the 75-mile trip to Stamford. That is, except for the four players who drove to Stamford on Saturday night and stayed at a motel so that they could sleep a bit later.,''I'd rather get up early to play, rather than play at 10 o'clock at night, which we usually do,'' said Robin Bischof, a 26-year-old lawyer who drove from South Windsor to Stamford with her husband, Tim, the only spectator at the game, and the coach of the Fighting Saints, Fran Getty. ''When we play late, I get home at midnight and am usually too wired up to go right to bed.'',Not to mention bruised, even though checking is not supposed to be allowed in women's hockey. At 5-feet-1 and 95 pounds, Ms. Bischof, who works in the Hartford County prosecutor's office, does take some physical punishment. ''I get muscled around and fall occasionally,'' said Ms. Bischof who scored her first goal of the season as South Windsor beat Stamford, 7-3. ''And I do wind up with bumps and bruises. But I love playing the game.'',So, apparently, do the hundreds of women in the state -- some of them well into their 50's -- who have taken up hockey with a passion in recent years, even though it usually means playing late at night or very early on weekend mornings. Many, if indeed not most, are mothers who decided to take up the game themselves -- often with no ice skating background whatsoever -- after having spent countless hours driving their hockey-playing children to practices before sunrise.,Indeed, as soon as the game between the Stamford Storm and the Fighting Saints had ended at 7:45 A.M., Mrs. Setian hurriedly shed her uniform and drove to the Darien Ice Rink to watch her 9-year-old son, Zachary, play in a junior league game. Such dedication is understandable since it was Zachary who, when he was 7, took his mother for a skating lesson at the Stamford Twin Rinks the night before Mother's Day in 1997. ''It was a Mother's Day present,'' Mrs. Setian said. ''I hadn't skated since I was in high school, and Zachary showed me how to stop and do some other things I had forgotten.'' As has been the case with most of the hockey-playing women at the start, Mrs. Setian was using a pair of her son's skates, and, eventually, his hockey stick and helmet.,Zachary still gives his Mom advice. ''One night this winter, I had a game right before his team's game at the Darien rink,'' Mrs. Setian said. ''So Zachary had a chance to watch me play. Later, he gave me some helpful hints.'',After her first lesson from her oldest son, Mrs. Setian soon got hooked. ''I bought my own skates and began to practice at the Twin Rinks,'' she said. ''Then about a year and a half ago, I saw a flyer at the rink saying a women's team, the Stamford Storm, was looking for players and I got involved. And am I glad I did.'' Along the way, Mrs. Setian also got some pointers from her husband, a former high school and college hockey player, who plays in a men's league at the Darien Ice Rink.,In all, there are five women who are mothers on the Storm's 19-team roster. The players range from rank newcomers like Mrs. Setian to experienced skaters like Sue Wyper of Darien, who has three sons and who played at Yale in the early 1980's, and Sue Reville of Stamford, the mother of two, who played with her husband's team in a coed league at the Terry Connors Rink in Stamford before she heard about the Storm last fall. ''This is more fun,'' Mrs. Reville said following a recent game at Twin Rinks.,But, to the players, it is also serious business. This is not a friendly round of golf or a tennis doubles match marked by laughter and chatter. Time and again during the Stamford-South Windsor game, players battling for the puck went crashing against the sideboards. ''It's essentially friendly competition,'' said Maria Cavalier Lovello of Stamford, the captain of the Storm. ''But at times words are exchanged.'',And they're not always friendly. ''It can be tough out there,'' Mrs. Setian said, ''but then the contact helps relieve some stress.'',By the time the six-month season ends in March, the Storm will have played at least 22 games, including 3 over a period of four days. The team played a rare outdoor game -- against the New Canaan Winter Club in New Canaan on Thursday night -- and a return match against the Fighting Saints in South Windsor last night. And tonight, the Storm -- whose 19 players pay $450 each toward the cost of ice time at Stamford Twin Rinks -- will play the Greenwich High School girls' team at the Dorothy Hamill Skating Rink in Greenwich.,The Storm owe their start to Cathy Prior of Ridgefield, who, until 1996, had never had donned a pair of ice skates. ''I had been driving my kids to practices and games for years and decided it was about time I had some fun, too,'' Mrs. Prior said. ''So I went out on the pond in back of our house with my daughter, Kerry, who was 12 at the time and had loaned me a pair of her skates. I was afraid of falling, and, of course, I fell about a million times.,''Still, I realized this could be fun. A few weeks later, I put a notice in about a dozen newspapers, looking for players to start a team at Twin Rinks in Stamford, and I got a response from about 12 women, none of whom had ever played hockey and most of whom had never even skated. Then we got a coach, Dave Cramoy, of Westport, to teach us how to play, and Twin Rinks, which had just opened, gave us ice time for practically nothing starting in March 1997. At first, some of the mothers' daughters came to play with us or to cheer us on. It made for a great bonding between the mothers and daughters. Eventually, about another dozen women got involved, and we had players from all over Fairfield County.'',''At first we just played for fun,'' said Mrs. Prior, who no longer plays for the Storm but, after recovering from injuries sustained during a fall -- at her home, not on the ice -- expects to be playing soon at rinks in Ridgefield and Brewster, N.Y. ''But by the second year, when we started playing other teams, it became more competitive and more aggressive.'',Mrs. Prior -- who helped organize a girls' hockey team at Ridgefield High School last fall and also officiates at hockey games -- had arranged those games by writing to ice skating rinks throughout Connecticut and in Westchester County to find out whether they had women's teams. Many of them, it turned out, did. Among the teams already in existence besides the South Windsor Lady Lightning were the Simsbury Mother Ducks, the Bolton Lady Lightning, the Washington Northern Lights and the Norwich Rose City Warriors, most of whom the Storm have played. Now, besides those teams, the Storm also plays teams from New York City, Long Island and Westchester, along with the girls' high school teams that have proliferated over the last two years.,''We've held our own with high school and college teams, including UConn and Trinity, but then run out of gas in the third period,'' said Beth Iacampo of Lebanon who plays with the Lady Lightning out of the Bolton Ice Palace; the team is believed to have been the first women's team formed in the state when they started playing in 1995.,Holding their own was clearly demonstrated recently when the Stamford Storm held a 5-1 lead over the Stamford Spinnakers -- a team made up of girls from the three Stamford high schools -- going into the third and final period only to have the much younger Spinnakers score four unanswered goals to wind up in a 5-5 tie.,Proving that it's never too late to start playing hockey, Mrs. Iacampo was 52 when she first laced up a pair of skates four years ago and went out for a lesson with her son, Michael, who coaches the Lady Lightning and also the boys' team at E. O. Smith High School in Mansfield. ''I felt it was quite an accomplishment to learn how to skate and then play hockey because I hadn't played sports in 20 years,'' said Mrs. Iacampo, who has five children and five grandchildren.,Like most of the women, Mrs. Iacampo started out using skates and other equipment belonging to her children. ''I used my two sons' stuff when, along with some other mothers in Wilton and Ridgefield, we got into hockey two years ago, to see if playing it was as much fun as watching, and of course it's even more fun,'' said Allison Slaughter of Wilton, who plays with the Ridgefield Herricanes on Sunday nights at the Brewster (N.Y.) Ice Arena. But as she got more serious about the game, Mrs. Slaughter, like most of the hockey-playing Moms, eventually outgrew the hand-me-down routine.,''After a while, my husband and kids began to give me hockey equipment -- pants, helmets and so on -- as gifts at Christmas, for my birthday and on Mother's Day,'' Mrs. Slaughter said. ''And we also bought equipment at ski and skate sales.,Mrs. Prior, the organizer of the Stamford Storm, said all the women's teams have improved dramatically, in large measure thanks to coaching by people like Fran Getty in South Windsor, Michael Iacampo in Bolton, Dave Cramoy of Westport and Don Kelly of Ridgefield. ''Most of us were falling down a lot when we started,'' said Mrs. Prior, who pointed out that some women's teams raise money through tag sales and car washes, along with lining up sponsors to help defray costs. ''It's a great aerobic workout and physically tiring, but it's certainly worth it.'' Even getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning. ''If my husband and I are out Saturday night,'' Mrs. Setian of the Stamford Storm said. ''I'll start looking at my watch around 9 o'clock and then say, 'We can't stay much longer. I've got a game at 6:30 in the morning.' And then we usually leave by 10. He's a good sport about it.'',But then Frank Setian is a hockey player, too.",JACK CAVANAUGH,"FEB. 28, 1999",No Sidelines for These Hockey Moms,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/no-sidelines-for-these-hockey-moms.html

"Tens of millions of Nigerians cast ballots today to choose their next president, hoping to end a long era of military dictatorship and to fulfill the promise of democracy for Africa's most populous country.,The elections, which were the culmination of one of the most tumultuous periods in Nigeria's history, appeared to draw a high voter turnout here in the country's largest city and in the capital, Abuja.,Results were not expected until late Sunday. But the front-runner remained Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former President and the only general to give up power voluntarily to a civilian Government. That elected Government, which began in 1979 and ended with a military coup in 1983, was the last time Nigeria had nonmilitary leaders.,Today's vote inspired enthusiasm even among typically skeptical residents of Lagos, the traditional southern center of opposition politics in a country long dominated by rulers from the north. As Ndubuisi Ebubeogu, a 36-year-old shipping worker, prepared to vote at a polling station in Ajengule, one of the biggest slums in Lagos, he said the electoral process was more important than whether General Obasanjo or his rival, Olu Falae, won.,''I am excited about this system,'' Mr. Ebubeogu said. ''If Falae wins, let it be given to him. If Obasanjo wins, let it be given to him. I want to believe in this system. Globally, things are going democratically. We want to join the globe.'',''Your child can be President of America whether he holds a gun or not,'' he continued. ''But here, because of what we have experienced, he cannot. I want to be able to tell my child that he can be President whether he is a military man or not, whether he is from the north or south -- only that he is a citizen of Nigeria.'',During the weeklong campaign, neither candidate offered specifics on how to address the myriad problems of a country potentially rich as the world's sixth-largest oil producer but hobbled by gross corruption and deep ethnic, religious and regional fissures. But if General Obasanjo sold himself as the man capable of safely guiding Nigeria to civilian rule from a military ever ready to snatch back power, his rival presented himself as a clean break from the past.,Mr. Falae, a former Finance Minister, attacked an Obasanjo presidency as a continuation of military rule. His message resonated in this country, which has been ruled by the military for all but 10 years since 1960. But it was undermined by his campaign's poor organization and overwhelmed by General Obasanjo's better-financed campaign, which enjoyed the support of the military.,General Obasanjo, a Yoruba from the southwest, is the candidate for the dominant People's Democratic Party. Mr. Falae, also a Yoruba from the southwest, is the joint candidate of the Alliance for Democracy and the All People's Party.,''We are hopeful the transition to democracy will be smooth and with the rest of the world watching Nigeria will once again regain its former glory,'' General Obasanjo said after voting in his hometown.,Mr. Falae also voted in his hometown. ''If the election today is free and fair and peaceful and General Obasanjo wins in those circumstances, I will be the first person to congratulate him,'' he said.,The United States and other Western countries have been trying to prod Nigeria toward civilian government. American oil companies, like Mobil and Chevron, have billions of dollars invested in Nigeria, which ranks as the fifth-biggest supplier of oil to the United States.,Local, statewide and national assembly elections since December were judged generally fair by election monitors. But there has been enough evidence of fraud that election officials suspect that of the 53 million registered voters in a population of 108 million, only 40 million are genuine.,And so for the presidential elections, officials took strict precautions, including having ballot papers printed in Britain, Nigeria's former colonial ruler. In a country where a little more than half the population is literate, people voted by having their thumbs stained with indelible ink and putting their print on the box next to one party's logo.,More than 115,000 polling stations were set up across the country, many in front of houses, on street corners or under trees. To be elected to a four-year term as president, a candidate must win the absolute majority of the popular vote and at least a quarter of the votes in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states. If neither of the candidates reaches those figures, whoever wins a simple majority in a runoff will be the winner.,In Nigeria's last presidential elections, in 1993, Moshood K. O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman from the south, appeared to be on the way to victory when the northern-led military Government annulled the elections. The event led to five years of ruthless dictatorship under Gen. Sani Abacha, whose violations of human rights turned Nigeria into an international pariah.,Last June, after General Abacha's unexpected death, his successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, began a series of reforms and eventually scheduled elections with the promise of a handover to a civilian government on May 29. But in the meantime, Mr. Abiola, who had been jailed for refusing to renounce his claim to the presidency, died suddenly under Government detention, plunging the nation into crisis and raising the specter of national disintegration.,In Lagos, in the Ajengule slum, A. O. Adebajo, a 65-year-old retired school principal, was the first in line to get accredited. Two election officials had set up a small wood table, which Mr. Adebajo had lent them, in front of the Vicky Best Beauty Salon and taped against a wall a poster that read, ''Polling Station.'',''I am really happy because we are going to a civilian government,'' Mr. Adebajo said. ''Since 1960, things have been up and down. If we are able to do this now, things will be better. It will be shameful if things do not go well this time around.'',His neighbor, Isaac Ekee, a 70-year-old who retired from the merchant marine, was skeptical.,''This election is our exercise of power on who is right to rule us,'' Mr. Ekee said. ''We know who is right to rule us. But I'm sure that many will try to rig it, the moneybags. You see big people are moving among themselves. They should just go home and rest and leave us alone.'',But the elections filled most people with hope, from Vivian Agbadike, 20, born the same year Nigeria's last civilian Government was elected, to Amina Umar, who says she is 100 and born 15 years before a British colonial Governor General cobbled together patches of land to create Nigeria in 1914.,''I just like voting,'' Miss Agbadike said. ''I want someone who is good to rule Nigeria.'',Mrs. Umar, her back bent, her figure so small that she had to reach over her head to drop her ballot inside the box, said: ''The President should take care of the interests of commoners and poor people like me. We want government to help us get money to solve our problems. We need food, we need money for our children to go to school. We need roads, water and light.''",NORIMITSU ONISHI,"FEB. 28, 1999","Nigerians Vote, With High Hopes for Civilian Rule",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/world/nigerians-vote-with-high-hopes-for-civilian-rule.html

"CARS were double-parked along both sides of 116th Street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues on a recent Sunday morning while services were held at three churches on the block. But only a few souls were straggling into the large white tents of the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market in the corner lot on Fifth Avenue.,Inside, vendors tended tables piled high with colorful masks from Senegal and Mali, ornate kente cloths, and blue jeans and T-shirts. Soualiho Soumahoro sat solemnly on a stool next to the table of hats he was selling.,''Sunday, Saturday, nothing,'' said Mr. Soumahoro, who is from the Ivory Coast, and has been a vendor at the market for two years. ''Not busy.'',Many vendors say that business has plummeted fast since the glory days of the 1980's and early 1990's. Back then the vendors had their stalls on 125th Street -- some had been there since the 1960's -- and during peak seasons 1,000 might be peddling their wares. But in October 1994, city officials swept out the vendors, most of whom were  illegal, saying they were clogging the sidewalks of what is in effect the Main Street of Harlem, causing litter and hurting legitimate enterprises.,Since then, the story of Harlem's vendors is one of economic fear and political tension. The vendors say they have been economically marginalized and their numbers reduced by their relocations to areas where business is worse. Meanwhile, the city and the company it hired to manage the vendors, the Malcolm Shabazz Development Corporation, say that they are trying to help the vendors become legitimate, and that a permanent $1.6 million home being built on 116th Street, with space for 132 vendors, will be ready in April.,After being displaced from 125th Street in 1994, the vendors were offered spaces on  Lenox Avenue between 116th and 117th Streets. But vendors say only about 200  chose to move there, with each paying $6 to $8 a day for a stall.,Then, in November, the managers of the market announced that the vendors would have to move again, to the present temporary location. This time only about 90 vendors signed up.,Some vendors want to sever relations with the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque, which runs the development firm, and manage their own affairs, as they did in the old days.,''If the city can get us our own space, we want to run it ourselves,'' said Bouba Ba, president of the Harlem Vendors Association, a group of 120 current and former vendors who organized in October to deal with their dissatisfactions. ''Even if we are not making a profit, we just want to deal with the city directly.'',Tensions between the mosque and some  vendors have escalated to a fever pitch in recent months. Mr. Ba and the group's general secretary, Oumar Ba (they are not related), said that they and about five other vendors had been barred from moving to the new temporary location, and that the management had called them rabble-rousers.,Izak-el M. Pasha, the imam of the mosque, said he had never heard of either Mr. Ba or the Harlem Vendors Association. As for any tensions between vendors and management, he said, ''We wanted to make sure that those who were going to the new site had completed all the necessary paperwork to become legitimate vendors.'',To move, vendors must have paid their fees consistently and not sold illegal items like bootleg tapes, he said, adding that he had heard that some vendors simply chose not to move.,In any event, some vendors say, they are losing customers with every move. Lionel McIntyre, director of planning at the Urban Technical Assistance Project, a program of the Urban Planning Program at Columbia University, said the location of the temporary sites makes the losses unsurprising.,''They're becoming more and more distant from the economic value areas,'' he said, ''from 125th Street to the shadows of 116th Street.'',He added, ''Tourists will be willing to come from the gateway of Harlem at 110th Street to 116th and Lenox, but now to come from 110th to 116th and then over to Fifth is much harder, it's physically marginalizing.'',Councilman Bill Perkins said the repeated relocation of vendors was an economic trend in the neighborhood, away from supporting individual enterprise and toward promoting chain stores and malls like Harlem U.S.A., now under construction in central Harlem.,''We have undervalued the small entrepreneur approach,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''We have perhaps overvalued or exaggerated the role that the mall can play.'',But Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said that the Mayor had received universal support from neighborhood elected leaders to move the street peddlers in 1994, and that  substantial investment has taken place in  Harlem ever since. ''I'm not sure what point he's trying to make,'' he said of Mr. Perkins. ''Either he's for investment in this community or he's against it.'',What about the promise of the permanent market, scheduled to be completed in April.  Mr. McIntyre said that, like the temporary sites, the new one is in a marginal location, half a block from the current spot.,But some vendors have high hopes for the new market, and Mr. Pasha said he had a  list of 100 vendors waiting for spots. He added that several factors would bolster the new market: renovation of the Lenox Avenue subway line, increased parking for tourist buses and cooperation between city agencies.,''It has been a long, long struggle to achieve that,'' Mr. Pasha said. ''Now we have the government, private industry and the community working together to try to address and make something good out of a situation that was originally not so good.''",NINA SIEGAL,"FEB. 28, 1999",NEW YORKERS & CO.; Slow Blues in Harlem For Street Vendors,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-slow-blues-in-harlem-for-street-vendors.html

"David Neal Miller has lived in Columbus, Ohio, since 1980, teaching Yiddish language and literature at Ohio State University. ''In central Ohio, Yiddish is no more exotic than Spanish or any other language,'' he said. But to Mr. Miller, 53, who grew up in Crown Heights, near the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Museum and within earshot of Ebbets Field, his New York roots are everything. ''I'm a Brooklyn boy,'' he said, ''a graduate of P.S. 241, Lefferts Junior High and Erasmus Hall High School.'',Hence 1010 President Street, a Web site named for Mr. Miller's childhood home.

So far, there are 106 pages of reminiscences, and Mr. Miller says that he's at least six months behind in putting up dozens more.,Readers' reports range form the laconic to the verbose. Some have pictures. Contributors tell stories of their lives, whether in Canarsie or Carroll Gardens, Brighton Beach or Brownsville. Most of them seem to share a similar sentiment: Brooklyn is more than a place. It's a state of mind, as one contributor, Bill Pasternak, put it.,LINKS -- Many.

"For Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the euphoria of his historic peacemaking visit to Pakistan was short-lived.,The stories about high-stakes nuclear diplomacy were quickly bumped off the front pages this week by his Government's mad scramble to salvage its move to dismiss the government of the eastern state of Bihar, one of India's poorest and most populous.,After furiously lobbying some of its own partners in the coalition Government it leads, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday managed to convince the lower house of Parliament to ratify the central Government takeover of the state. The Government made the move on the grounds that two massacres of low-caste people there in the past month demonstrated a breakdown of law and order.,But the upper house of Parliament is still expected to vote against ratification, probably next week. The measure can be introduced anytime in the next six weeks. If it is defeated, the government of Bihar will be restored to power and the wobbly national coalition Government will have sustained yet another blow to its credibility.,Earlier this month, Mr. Vajpayee's Government removed the populist first couple of Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife, Rabri Devi, from power. It acted after a second massacre of low-caste people on Feb. 11. In less than three weeks, a private militia organized by upper caste landowners killed 34 men, women, and children from the caste known as the untouchables, or the Dalits.,Such butchery has occurred sporadically over the last 20 years in Bihar as an outgrowth of the struggle between landowners and poor farm workers who have sought to be treated with dignity and paid higher wages. Hundreds have been killed.,The Government had been confident that its takeover of the state would be ratified in Parliament, especially after Sonia Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party, declared that the government of Bihar had lost the moral authority to govern following the second massacre.,The Congress Party, which has led India for most of its 51 years of  independence, has itself invoked the constitutional provision that allows a national takeover of state governments dozens of times. Many critics say the provision has often been misused for partisan political gain.,But Monday, the Congress Party surprised the national Government by announcing that it would oppose a takeover in Bihar, making ratification doubtful in the upper house of Parliament, where the opposition is stronger.,Congress Party officials said the massacres, while ghastly, did not warrant the ejection of an elected government. They also accused Mr. Vajpayee's Government of installing a partisan, political official as governor of the state, betraying its self-interested intentions.,But both the Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the coalition Government, and the Congress Party could have political motives. A central Government takeover of Bihar would allow the governing party and its allies to use the patronage and power of the state to strengthen their weak political position there, political analysts say.,And the Congress Party, which trounced the Bharatiya Janata Party in state elections last November, needs to regain ground in Bihar and neighboring Uttar Pradesh, two powerhouses in the Hindu heartland, if it is to lead the national Government again without a heavy reliance on a patchwork of allies.,The Congress Party can ill-afford to let the governing party gain the upper hand in Bihar, experts say, nor does it wish to be seen as supporting the Hindu nationalist party that the substantial minority of Muslim voters in those states oppose.,For the last nine years, the state has been flamboyantly ruled by Mr. Yadav or his wife, who present themselves as the champions of the lower castes and religious minorities.,In the debate in the lower house of Parliament, Home Minister L. K. Advani portrayed the decision to dismiss the Bihar government as motivated solely by a desire to protect the people of the state. ''This decision has not been taken for or against any party,'' he said.,But Sharad Pawar, a Congress Party leader, accused the governing party of using the massacres for its own political ends. ''Of course politics has its own place,'' Mr. Pawar said. ''But for the sake of your political benefit, you should not use Dalits for that purpose.'',Mr. Yadav declared on the floor, ''You are attempting to destroy a government of the poor people.'',Human rights workers and advocates for the Dalits say they are skeptical that the violence against agricultural workers will stop, whether there is a takeover or the Laloo Yadav-Rabri Devi government returns to power.",CELIA W.

"THE police say that when drivers return to parking spaces or garages to find an empty space once occupied by their car, they often engage in a brief denial. Surely they must have parked it somewhere else -- perhaps on another street? Another floor?,Carole Blaufeld of Mamaroneck did not go through that. Her car, a 1992 Lexus, was stolen from her driveway, despite the fact that it was locked and had an activated security system. ''We're a two-car family with a one-car garage,'' Mrs. Blaufeld said. ''My husband went out in the morning to leave and came back and said, 'I think it's gone.' I thought he was kidding.'',The fact that auto theft has declined in Westchester is of little comfort to Mrs. Blaufeld or others among the owners of the 10 or so vehicles stolen in the county each day. The drop in auto theft mirrors a statewide trend, in which most felonies are down. Nonetheless, District Attorney Jeanine Pirro and the County Police Commissioner, Louis D'Aliso have formed a new unit to combat auto theft and related crimes, including auto insurance fraud and car jacking.,''Westchester is prime fertile ground for auto theft both because of its affluent character as well as its proximity to New York City and the Bronx,'' Mrs. Pirro said. ''It puts us in a unique situation where we could be a focal point for not just the theft of cars but also for the breaking up of cars.'',Mrs. Pirro said she was particularly concerned about chop shops, where stolen cars are delivered and dismantled and then sold for parts. Arrests have been made at businesses in Irvington, Mount Kisco and Port Chester, after the police found evidence of stolen vehicles.,The biggest raid took place last spring in Irvington at Autobahn Recycling Center, a repair shop that specialized in Mercedes-Benzes. The name was apt. ''Unfortunately, they were recycling other people's cars,'' Irvington Police Chief Richard Denike, said.,When the police investigated, they said they found eight stolen Mercedes-Benzes in various stages of being stripped down in the garage. Dozens of parts, including engines, transmissions and vehicle frames were recovered. In addition, the police found more than 100 vehicle identification numbers, or VINS, which are frequently taken from cars salvaged from junkyards and reattached to stolen car parts.,In Mount Kisco, a tip led the police to Dent Crafters, a car-detailing business, where several stolen cars were recovered. In Port Chester, Dominick Mecca was arrested at his business, Westchester Fiberglass, where he was charged with criminal possession of stolen property and 21 counts of illegal possession of vehicle identification numbers.,''What Mr. Mecca was doing was going to a salvage dealer, buying a total wreck at auction for a ridiculously low price -- because he was really buying the VIN number,'' said Lieut. William T. Carey of the New York State Police Special Investigations Unit, which worked on the case. ''He would then go out and acquire good parts through stolen cars and put together automobiles around that VIN.'',The district attorney's office said it was not sure how long the chop shop activity had been going on. ''There was no real focus on this in the previous administration,'' Mrs. Pirro said. ''I have no reason to believe that the chop shops we have just unearthed just popped up. My thinking is once we put more resources into this, we're going to find more chop shops.'',Mrs. Pirro said the new auto theft unit would bring a central focus to the issue, something that had been difficult when each of the county's 42 police jurisdictions handled investigations. The unit will be part of the District Attorney's Organized Crime and Criminal Enterprise Bureau and is supported by a grant from the State Division of Criminal Justice Services.,Detective Sgt. Patrick M. O'Reilly of the Mount Kisco police, said that the coordinated effort would be an enormous help to smaller departments like his own. ''There's no doubt crime is being pushed up north from the city,'' he said. ''We're a small village dealing with city crimes, and we haven't had the resources to investigate auto theft. We may stop a car that has a questionable VIN, but, unlike the city, we had no selective response team, so who could we turn to? This is going to be a great benefit.'',According to the latest available state figures, 4,130 vehicles were stolen in Westchester County in 1997, giving the county the eighth highest rate of vehicle theft in New York of 62 counties. The numbers had been declining. In 1990, 6,245 vehicles were stolen in Westchester; by 1993 the number had dropped to 4,809. Each subsequent year the numbers dropped slightly, until 1996 when 3,915 cars were stolen. The 1997 figures represent the first reversal in the downward trend.,The most commonly stolen car in the New York region in 1998 was the 1997 Toyota Corolla, according to CCC Information Systems, based in Chicago. Other popular candidates for theft were the 1997 Nissan Maxima GLE, the 1997 Nissan Maxima SE, the 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser 4  by 4, the 1996 Honda Accord LX, the 1992 Acura Legend L, the 1997 Honda Accord LX, the 1991 Acura Legend, the 1994 Acura Legend L and the 1993 Acura Legend. This report differs from recent national trends.,Cars are stolen for a variety of reasons, the police say. Occasionally, teen-agers steal cars for joy rides. Stolen vehicles are sometimes used in robberies or other crimes. There is also a large market for luxury cars to be sent abroad.,The biggest reason for theft, however, is for parts, an operation that law enforcement officials say they view as organized crime, given the fact that it requires different people to steal the cars, dismantle them and then sell the parts. ''This effort represents a significant undertaking in the dismantling of organized criminal enterprises in Westchester County,'' Commissioner D'Aliso said.,Fewer than half of all stolen vehicles are recovered, Lieutenant Carey of the state police, said. Mrs. Blaufeld did get her car back, but not whole. ''We got a call that they had found the car in the Bronx, and the guy said, 'Oh, it isn't bad -- it's just the hood and fenders are missing.' But when we had the insurance appraisal, they listed 195 parts missing. It was totally gutted.'',The police say there are steps that residents can take to help prevent car theft. Obviously, cars should be locked, and if possible, parked in a well-lighted area. If there is a security system it should be activated. Devices like the Club -- which locks the steering wheel -- deter thieves, and Lojack, in which a small homing beacon is hidden in the car, can improve chances of recovery.,But the police caution that if a thief wants a particular vehicle, the way someone wanted Mrs. Blaufeld's, there is little a car owner can do. There are, however, steps one can take to improve the chances of identifying the vehicle if it is stolen. One simple action is to slip business cards in different crevices of the car: down the window well, in the trunk and deep into the seats. Sometimes this enables the police to identify the owner, even if the vehicle identification numbers have been removed.,The new auto theft unit will also coordinate a new state program called ''Watch Your Car'' in which motorists can have their vehicle identification number etched into their car's windows or windshield at no cost. The etching has proved a deterrent to car theft because the thief would have to replace or discard all of the glass. The number to call for more information is (914) 285-3420.",KATE STONE LOMBARDI,"FEB. 28, 1999",New County Unit Aims to Deter Auto Theft,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/new-county-unit-aims-to-deter-auto-theft.html

"Darby A. Nelson and Mariama L. S. Johnson, both 9, are fourth-grade classmates in the program for the gifted and talented at Public School 9 on West 84th Street. Until about a month ago they expected, after graduation this spring, to attend the Delta Program, for gifted and talented students in fifth through eighth grades at Intermediate School 54, on West 107th Street.,But the girls fear that a proposed change in Community School District 3's gifted and talented program may alter their plans.,The Delta Program's coordinator, Frederick R. LaSenna, said that for at least 10 years, all fourth-grade graduates of gifted and talented programs at P.S. 9; P.S. 163, on West 97th Street, and P.S. 145, on West 105th Street, went on to fifth grade at the popular Delta Program. But district officials, citing limited classroom space at I.S. 54, say they may end automatic admission for the three feeder schools, and have asked them to consider not sending their students until sixth grade.,This is not the only concern to surface recently about the Delta Program. Some students and parents at P.S. 208 on 111th Street, which is also in District 3, are complaining that it is unfair that fifth graders from that school's gifted and talented program must take a test to qualify for the Delta sixth grade, since those from the other three schools are admitted automatically.,''I felt uncomfortable with the fact that there are children who are guaranteed a seat when I have to take a test for it and they don't,'' Angelique Angram, a fifth grader,  told local school board members at a meeting on Wednesday. ''It's a shame that my fifth grade gifted and talented class has to struggle to get into that program.'',P.S. 208's principal, Corine Pettey, said Miss Angram had scored in the 99th percentile on the city's reading and math tests, and should be given the same access to the Delta Program afforded to the other children. ''What we have now is an unequal situation,'' she said.,The school district plans to vote this week on a proposal that would end all automatic admissions to the Delta Program and would delay the admission of fourth graders from the three feeder schools until the start of sixth grade.,Miss Nelson and Miss Johnson express hope that the proposal meets with a resounding defeat.,''It's not really fair to us,'' Miss Johnson said, ''because we were working so hard to get into that school, and now we're going to have to wait.'',School officials, meanwhile, are making contingency plans. P.S. 163's principal, Jorge Izquierdo, said that while keeping the 56 gifted and talented students in his school for one more year would add to a burdensome overcrowding problem, he has requested portable classrooms from the district, and is interviewing teachers.,''It means more work for me, but we'll get through it,'' Mr. Izquierdo said.

"A few years ago, the west side of Broadway between 105th and 106th Streets resembled Swing Street, with two popular jazz bars, Birdland and Augie's. But Birdland moved to West 44th Street in 1997, and Augie's closed last August. Meanwhile, the small shops on the east side of Broadway continued to bustle with customers.,Last month, Tofu, the large Chinese and Japanese restaurant that had replaced Birdland, closed, and Chase Bank moved out of its large storefront on the northeast corner of Broadway and 106th Street. Several local business owners wondered if franchise stores would ride the winds of change into the area, as they have on most nearby blocks of Broadway. ''Once the franchises invade, landlords will think it's open season, and rents will go up too much and endanger us,'' said Gerry M. Wendrovsky, a lawyer with a narrow storefront office next to where Augie's had been.,John Alvarez, a manager for 32 years at Riverside Liquors, opposite the shuttered Tofu, voiced the same fear. ''It's just a matter of time before they come,'' he said. ''Knowing your landlord used to mean you were safe, but the big money will win out.'',Yes and no, at least so far. Duane Reade does plan to open a large branch at the Chase site, said an official at Stahl Real Estate, which owns the building. And a branch of Software Etc. recently opened next store. On the west side of Broadway, though, owners have kept rent increases minimal and renewed leases of smaller tenants.,The Birdland/Tofu site has been leased for 15 years by the Lusardi Group, which owns several Upper East Side restaurants, said Burt Wallack, president of Wallack Management, which manages the building. Lusardi plans to open an upscale Italian restaurant after a $1 million renovation, he said.,Augie's former manager, Paul Steche, said he had signed a long-term lease and would reopen the bar by the end of March. Osvaldo Rosado, the property manager for that and two small storefronts south of it,  said he wanted to keep small businesses in those spaces. The neighborhood is diverse, and many working-class Hispanic families live east of Broadway, with wealthier residents in large apartments along West End Avenue and Riverside Drive.,The executive director of the West Side Chamber of Commerce, Andrew Albert, saw the recent flurry of economic activity on the block as an uptown expansion of Broadway's current prosperity past 96th Street. ''That was a forgotten area for a while,'' he said, ''but Broadway is really hot right now, and it's spilling over.'',Mr. Wendrovsky said that while local landlords want to maintain the character of the block, ''there's also a financial incentive to keep rents slightly lower, because they know the local shopkeepers will pay the rent regularly and on time, whereas, with franchise clients, they can wind up with a dispossess in the commercial part of housing court.''

"The ruddy-faced man tucked the large large school bell under his arm and stared nervously down the block. Kevin P. Scanlon, the principal of St. Ignatius Loyola School, on East 84th Street, said he had long enjoyed ringing the bell outside the school entrance and greeting each of his 545 students, who range from kindergarteners through eighth graders.,But this school year he has been barely glancing down to return students' morning greetings, he said, because he is frantically deploying parents and teachers to help students navigate the busy intersection at Park Avenue and 84th Street,In past years there has been a crossing guard to keep a safe distance between children and the many cars and school buses dropping off students during rush hour. But there has been no guard since September, and Mr. Scanlon is tired of waiting.,''They keep saying 'soon,' but now I don't know what 'soon' means anymore,'' he said.,State Assemblyman John Ravitz said the 19th Precinct had not posted an officer at the site, despite his requests. ''I understand the need for background checks and care in picking someone to work closely with children,'' he said of the crossing guard selection process, ''but this has just taken too long.'',Sgt. Everett Oliver, who handles the placement of crossing guards in the precinct, said he had submitted three applications to headquarters. But for months, he said, ''we didn't seem to be getting anywhere.'',There are 17 crossing guard positions on the Upper East Side, Sergeant Oliver said, and three of them are vacant. ''We can't pull beat cops for that anymore,'' he said. ''We have no bodies.'',Replacing a guard takes a long time, he said, because there are few qualified candidates and the department must conduct background checks, complete Civil Service paperwork and organize a two-week training session.,''Nobody wants this job,'' said Giselle Casella, the crossing guard at 84th Street and Madison Avenue, a nine-year veteran. New guards make $7.21 an hour and work four hours each school day, she said, ''but you have to show up three different times a day for four hours' pay.'',Sergeant Oliver, though, sounds optimistic. He said St. Ignatius might get its crossing guard by the end of March.,''I'll believe it when I see it,'' Mr. Scanlon said.

"A battle is being waged on lower Broadway over a nightclub preparing to open at No. 372. Residents say they don't want the noise, traffic and  crowds they think that the 800-capacity club will bring. But the club's owner has vowed to press on.,On Wednesday, dozens of people who live on Broadway near White Street, the club's location, attended a  State Liquor Authority hearing to oppose an application by Mark Newberger to transfer a liquor license from the defunct Bowery Room, a bar he used to own at 1 Bleecker Street, to the new club, whose name is yet to be announced.,The liquor authority said it would look into the neighbors' concerns. The matter is scheduled to be taken up again this week.,''We oppose this club for many reasons,'' said Barry Mallin, a lawyer representing residents. ''There are other licensed establishments within 500 feet, there has been illegal construction done without a permit and there has been no analysis of the noise, traffic and other problems this would bring to the community.'',City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed and Community Board 1 are among the club opponents, who include many residents of Mandarin Plaza, a modern residential building next door.,''Already, they have shown us they are not going to be good neighbors,'' said Alan Zakin, who lives at Mandarin Plaza. Residents of that building have joined others in the area in forming a new group called the Eastern TriBeCa Family Association.,''This whole area has become very family oriented,'' said Bonnie Seegmiller, who lives nearby at 166 Broadway. ''We are working very hard to have a decent place to raise our kids, so this is the last thing we need.'',She added, ''Years ago, when the Mudd Club was down here, there were constant problems. But since this was mostly a commercial area, we had to look at it differently. But not now.'',Mr. Newberger, who applied to the Department of Buildings on Feb. 16 for a construction permit and a place-of-assembly permit, declined to be interviewed. His lawyer, David Lenetsky, said he had no knowledge of any illegal construction at the site. ''We don't want to have an adversarial relation with the community,'' he said, ''although we do have one right now.'',Mr. Lenetsky also disputed residents' assertions that noise from the club would come through a common wall between Mandarin Plaza and 372 Broadway. He said there is no common wall, but rather a sand-filled space.,Moreover, he said, 12 security guards would be present whenever the club was open, and valet parking would be arranged to reduce traffic congestion.,As for the neighborhood opposition, Mr. Lenetsky said some people were exaggerating. ''They really go overboard with this stuff,'' he said. ''It's like the Jacobins in the French Revolution.''

"Elizabeth Ernish met her future fiance in Prospect Park. On the night of their engagement last September, they rode their bikes under a canopy of London plane trees along the park's West Drive, stopping to admire the lantern-lighted Tennis House through a stand of trees.,So when she was planning her wedding to Alan Mukamal, a software engineer, Ms. Ernish naturally chose the Tennis House. ''I have always loved that building,'' she said of the neoclassical limestone-and-brick colonnade, which was built in 1910. ''I  fantasized about getting married there long before I had a fiance.'',But a month after sending a $625 deposit for her June 5 wedding to the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment, a nonprofit educational group that leases the Tennis House from the Parks Department, she received unhappy news.,With the invitations at the printer's, the Hawaiian swing band already booked and the wedding less than four months away, Ms. Ernish was told on Feb. 16 that she would have to find someplace else. The reason, officials said, was that in May the city would begin a major renovation of the vaulted, red-tiled roof of the Tennis House.,''They told me that the whole thing would be covered with scaffolding and a cyclone fence and that there was no way I could have my wedding there,'' Ms. Ernish said.,But Ms. Ernish refused to be mauled by the city's machinery. She  repeatedly phoned Tupper W. Thomas, Prospect Park's administrator. She sent E-mails to Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, imploring him to delay the project.,Ms. Ernish is a planner for the Sam Schwartz Company, a consulting firm run by a former city transportation commissioner, and is used to bureaucracies. But at first she had no luck. Ms. Thomas even became a ''de facto wedding planner,'' helping her scout out alternative sites, but the repair project was still on.,Then, by week's end, Ms. Ernish learned from Ms. Thomas that the project would be postponed until June 7, two days after her wedding.,''She was an absolute angel,'' said Ms. Ernish, referring to Ms. Thomas. Even more impressive is that Ms. Ernish is the former campaign director for Transportation Alternatives, a group that is fervently pushing for a car-free Prospect Park.,''I made Tupper Thomas's life really difficult,'' Ms. Ernish said.,No other events will be affected by the delay, said John C. Muir, head of the Brooklyn center.,Ms. Thomas said the mixup was a result of miscommunication.,Ms. Ernish said, ''They obviously felt it was not good for the Parks Department to boot a bride.''

"Last August and September, several residents along Lydig Avenue found their apartments burglarized and jewelry and electronic equipment stolen. A short time later, one victim alerted officers at the 49th Precinct that a necklace taken from her apartment was in a display case at G & J Jewelry, on Lydig Avenue between Holland and Cruger Avenues, according to the precinct commander, Capt. Hazel Stewart.,The complaint prompted the precinct's Special Operations Unit to conduct an investigation in which undercover officers sold jewelry that they said was stolen to G & J's owner, Yakov Babayev, three times last September, said Lieut. Anthony Vincent. The sales allowed the police to close the store on Jan. 27, citing the Nuisance Abatement Law, which allows padlocking of an establishment seen as promoting illegal activity.,But the store was reopened a day later after Mr. Babayev paid a $4,000 fine and agreed in Bronx Civil Court to sell the store, said Dana Jenkins, a Police Department lawyer. Ms. Jenkins said last week that he was to sign another agreement promising to sell the store within 90 days, a fact that pleased residents of the Pelham Parkway neighborhood.,''My neighbors were robbed and their goods and worldly possessions were sold to a neighborhood store,'' said Elaine Feder, who lives in the area and organized a tenants council for Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein. ''Things like that didn't happen in the neighborhood when we were growing up.'',There were 653 burglaries in the 49th Precinct last year, down from 1,079 in 1997. This year so far burglaries are down by 15 percent compared with the same time last year, Lieutenant Vincent said. He attributed some of the drop to similar undercover operations. ''You're closing down an avenue for these people to sell in the neighborhood,'' he said. ''It has to have an impact.'',In an interview last week, Mr. Babayev denied knowingly buying stolen goods from the police or anyone else. ''The only thing I did wrong,'' he said, ''was not ask whether the goods were stolen.'' Police officials, though, say the undercover officers explicitly told the him that the jewelry had been stolen.,Mr. Babayev's landlord, Alan Adler, a retired city detective who has owned the property for 21 years, said the Police Department would screen potential buyers of G & J to weed out those involved in prior illegal activity.

"The killing last year of Matthew Shepard, the gay Wyoming college student who was beaten and left to die on a prairie fence post, sent shock waves across the country and changed the national debate over social tolerance and hate-crime laws. Now, indirectly, it may also be changing a city policy that bars access to prescription drugs to people under arrest.,The issue of police confiscation of medication came to light Oct. 20, when at least 110 people were arrested in midtown during a march for Mr. Shepard that police said lacked a permit and was blocking traffic. At least eight people who were arrested complained that they had critical medications either confiscated or withheld while they were in custody, the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project said. Some of them, the group said, were H.I.V.-positive men who must take complex regimens of antiviral medications at regular intervals or risk developing resistance to those drugs.,Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, who represents the 64th District on the West Side of Manhattan, was among those alarmed by the police action. ''I had constituents involved in this, and as chair of the Assembly Health Committee, I felt the need to intervene,'' he said.,Last month, Mr. Gottfried said, he met with the criminal justice coordinator in Mayor Giuliani's office, Steven Fishner, who told him he had begun organizing several city agencies to deal with the issue.,''City Hall seems to share my concerns that something must be done to deal with access to medications for detainees,'' Mr. Gottfried said. ''The Mayor's office is coming close to having draft recommendations pulled together, although there's a long list of administrative complications to deal with. And the police raise legitimate issues about security and the like. But I think they can be worked out.'',Mr. Gottfried said the Mayor's office has brought together officials from the police, the Corrections Department, the Health Department and the Fire Department, ''because emergency medical technicians might be used to administer medications.'' In addition to H.I.V., he said, other conditions are also involved, like heart disease, epilepsy, asthma and diabetes.,A Police Department spokesman, Inspector Michael Collins, declined to comment. ''We're going to take our cue from the Mayor's office,'' he said.,A mayoral spokeswoman, Jennifer Chait, said, ''We are reviewing the policy and cannot at this time comment further because the matter is in litigation.'',David Braff, a lawyer representing five people arrested last October, said he has begun the process of suing the city in Federal court. He said three of his clients were denied medication for H.I.V., one for asthma and one for mental illness. He said he knew of at least three other similar cases.,Mr. Braff said his clients were told they had the option of going to a hospital to receive their medication, but that they were also told ''it would greatly delay things.'' One man with H.I.V. did go to a hospital, he said, only to find that it did not have the medication he needed.,The people he is representing, Mr. Braff said, were seeking ''monetary relief'' and  ''policies that would provide for adequate protection in the future.'',''This is pretty fundamental stuff,'' he said. ''We're talking about basic civil liberties here.''   DAVID KIRBY",DAVID KIRBY,"FEB. 28, 1999","NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE; Arrested?

"Since closing its shelter for homeless adults in 1994, Project Hospitality, a nonprofit social service agency, has sent people who go to its drop-in center to three small church shelters in New Brighton. Now the agency wants to buy a partly vacant warehouse at Jersey and Benziger Streets and turn it into a 24-hour shelter with 30 beds. Some residents have opposed the plan, saying that with 15 shelter beds across the street at New Directions Baptist Church, the neighborhood has enough.,The new shelter would house 24 men and 6 women deemed ready for vocational training and, potentially, housing of their own. But one opponent, Joseph Marotta, a member of Community Board 1, has expressed concern that it will not displace the existing ''emergency bed'' shelter at New Directions, as Project Hospitality has promised.,Last June, the board voted to support the shelter. But Mr. Marotta  raised a procedural objection that sent the matter to the board's human resource and rules committees for review. That allowed opponents time to organize and speak out against the shelter at board meetings through the fall and winter. In January, the board affirmed its endorsement of the new shelter, yet the opposition persists.,One board member, Janet Lynch-Brusco, said, ''I would rather that the church-based shelters remain, because they are scattered throughout the community.'',Bobbe Butler, a member of the New Brighton Citizens Committee, said: ''Jersey Street is already supersaturated with social services. There are two low-income projects in a 10-block stretch.'',The executive director of Project Hospitality, Terry Troia, said that ''in a show of good faith,'' 15 beds in two New Brighton churches have already been shifted outside the community, and 15 more will be eliminated when the new shelter opens. Ms. Troia said the agency has raised $800,000 from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and local bank foundations, but needs another $400,000 to renovate the space.,''We want it to be safe and esthetically beautiful,'' she said. She said that if enough money can be raised, the shelter will open in early 2000.,Meanwhile, Mr. Marotta is still fighting. He has urged the board to schedule a public hearing devoted solely to the subject of a new shelter. But George Caputo, the chairman of the board, said, ''We followed all proper procedures and the vote that we took will stand.'',One door down from the shelter site is a bodega owned by Aure Caba. Like several people in the area who were interviewed last week, Mr. Caba said he supports the shelter as long as it doesn't bring in drugs.  ''The people in this neighborhood need a place where they can get help,'' he said. ''Homeless people should live, too.''

"THE SETTING -- Right there, across the street from Planet Hollywood on West 57th Street, a bunch of women were making voodoo dolls on a Friday night. Sew Fast, Sew Easy, a fabric and notions shop that offers workshops in sewing, crocheting and the like, holds a voodoo doll class once a year, around Valentine's Day. This year, it was on Feb. 19.,The most evil thing about the proceedings seemed to be the supermarket-bought birthday cake with a blood-red jam streak. (Rarely do women gather and not snack.) The room was papered with ripped-out pages from fashion magazines, and the black pieces of cut fabric that had been laid out on a table looked a lot like gingerbread men. There were also white shapes with wings so the faint of heart could make guardian angels.,THE BUZZ -- The mood was cheerful, as a dozen or so participants, including a lawyer, a comedian, a couple of actresses and a 12-year-old and her mother, sat at sewing machines or stood at tables.,The proprietor of Sew Fast Sew Easy, Elissa Meyrich, explained the inspiration for the first voodoo-doll session: her landlord and his lawyer. ''Mine are fierce, really evil dolls,'' she said, bringing them out of a closet. Things are fine now with the landlord, she said. Satisfied with the relief she got from her doll making, Ms. Meyrich said, ''I thought people would really enjoy this.'',One participant, Liza McKee, 25, was apparently experiencing man trouble. ''I've never been angry until this year,'' said Ms. McKee, a comedian who does temp work in offices by day. ''I used to be really sweet.''  Her doll was a male figure, wearing a shiny cape to conceal its hairy back and holding a tiny felt book. On its chest was a big scarlet letter A. Ms. McKee declined to name names or to describe what she'd ever appreciated about ''the boy.'',Donna Menghini, 31, a lawyer, decided to make an angel: ''I have so much negativity at work, I needed something lighter.'',Kelly-Beth Foster, 12, and her mother, Brye Foster, worked quietly on their dolls. Ms. Foster's female doll was voluptuous. The focal point of her daughter's doll was its hair, made of multicolored, multitextured yarns. Kelly-Beth said she had been making dolls at home from cut-up Catholic-school uniforms she had outgrown.,Deborah Williams, a longtime customer at Sew Fast Sew Easy who came at Ms. Meyrich's invitation, said the class had ''a great vibe going.'',At the first one two years ago, Ms. Williams said, ''There were serious voodoo people.'' Last year, Ms. Meyrich said, ''People were out with a vengeance.'',Gina DiSalvo, 37, a legal secretary, put a hula skirt on what she called her ''Sports Illustrated voodoo doll.'' She explained, ''This one is for the 90 percent of us'' who do not look like models.,What would she do with the doll? ''I'll bring it to work and when I get frustrated with the copy room or a boss, I'll pound away.'' If you are a person who sews, she said, ''You always have pins on you.''   ERIN ST.

"For years, boaters and others who use the Hudson River waterfront have complained that NY Waterway commuter ferries batter boats and docks between the Battery and Chelsea. A new group is forming to address the problem.,''NY Waterway boats come screaming down the pierhead line,'' Adam Brown, the president of the Working Waterfront Association, a maritime advocacy group, said on Thursday. ''I was out there this week and saw them 150 feet off the bulkhead, charging downriver.'',His group recently created the Harbor Safety Committee, to address other problems in that crowded section of the river. Its first meeting is set for March 15 at the Coast Guard building in Battery Park.,Lieut. Chip Lopez of the Coast Guard said the wake problems are ''best solved by getting people to talk about it and come up with solutions that everyone can live with.'',Lieutenant Lopez said the Coast Guard can enforce only Federal laws, which do not cover vessel speed or distance from shore.'' Those matters are covered by the city's Department of Transportation. Agency officials did not respond to requests for comment.,Pat Smith, a spokesman for NY Waterway, whose headquarters is in Weehawken, N.J., said that the company has joined the committe. He also disputed accounts that the company's ferries, which run between New Jersey and Manhattan, travel at high speeds near the shoreline. ''They are operated in a safe and courteous fashion,'' Mr. Smith said, adding that the ferries make about 1,100 crossings each weekday, carrying some 30,000 passengers. ''They stay right in the middle of the river until approaching the dock.'',Not so, said Jim Gallagher, the owner of an old ferryboat, the Yankee, which he is restoring at Pier 26, near North Moore Street. Over the years Mr. Gallagher has helped organize other boaters buffeted by the wakes. ''We filed over 200 wake complaints,'' he said. ''The Coast Guard gave us complaint forms to fill out, but they never do anything. Nobody feels like it's their jurisdiction. The Coast Guard won't respond unless a life is at stake and the harbor police always say, 'We'll be right over to take a look,' but they never do.'',Mr. Gallagher said the largest wakes occur during morning and evening rush hours. ''The ferries come by every 10 minutes; the wake kills everything along this corridor,'' he said, ''It's like two small hurricanes every day. At high tide, it's spectacular, a giant wave rocking us like a metronome. The small boats jump out of the water.'',Boat owners and marina operators from North Cove, at the World Financial Center; the River Project and Downtown Boathouse, at Pier 26; Chelsea Piers; and Pier 63 Maritime, at West 24th Street, voiced similar complaints. They said violent ferry wakes damaged piers and the bulkhead, caused boats and floating docks to collide, posed serious safety hazards and made it impossible to sleep on smaller vessels. cents,Mr. Gallagher said would join the committe but still fight the company. ''We may be just a bunch of boaters, and they're a huge company,'' he said. ''But they didn't buy the river.''

"For 63 years, the John J. Harvey was part of the Fire Department's fleet of boats used to extinguish fires aboard vessels in the waters surrounding the city. Since 1994, when the John J. Harvey was taken out of service, it has languished in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But now eight investors have bought the rusty fireboat and plan to renovate it, perhaps to turn it into a museum. Last week it was transported, with the help of a tugboat, to its new home on Pier 63.,One investor, a boat builder named Jorge Phillips, said he first saw the John J. Harvey in the Brooklyn Navy Yard four years ago, while he was working for the South Street Seaport Museum. When he was invited last month to join a group raising $28,010 to buy the boat, he leapt at the chance. ''If you like boats, that one has everything,'' he said. ''It has engines, machinery, and cannons that throw water up in the air.'',Mr. Phillips was not the only one who had an eye on the 130-foot boat. John Krevey, an electrical contractor and officer of the North River Historic Ship Society, owns a restored lightship called the Frying Pan, which he berths at Pier 63 in Chelsea and rents out for private functions. Mr. Krevey, who leases the pier from the nearby Basketball City sports center, offered space there for the fireboat when he heard in late 1997 that the city was planning to dispose of it. Last month he was notified that the vessel was to be auctioned, and he quickly assembled a group to buy it.,''This boat was in service longer than any other fireboat in New York City, and when it was built it was the most powerful fireboat in the world,'' said Mr. Krevey, who is not an investor but is allowing the boat to dock at the pier free. ''It was also historically significant to New York Harbor.'',The John J. Harvey, named after the pilot of another fireboat who died in the line of duty in 1930, was built at the Todd Shipyards in Brooklyn in 1931 at a cost of $594,000. It has five diesel engines and eight water cannons that could propel 16,000 gallons of water per minute. In 1942, its crew fought a fire aboard the Normandie, then the largest existing luxury liner, which was being converted into a troopship.,''Now it's our job to bring this boat back to what it was,'' Mr. Phillips said.

"In the first public debate over the Police Department's 16-month-old practice of using video surveillance in and around Washington Square Park, residents and merchants credited the cameras with chasing away drug dealers and restoring an air of safety.,But some civil libertarians and park users at last week's hearing, which was  sponsored by Community Board 2, said the high-powered lenses invade privacy. Carl Rosenstein, a SoHo resident who led a petition drive against the cameras, argued that citizens should have ''the freedom to assemble without surveillance.'',If anything, people will be assembling, chatting and kissing under yet more police cameras. Officials from the Sixth Precinct announced at Thursday's hearing that two months ago new cameras had been installed on the corners of the Avenue of the Americas and West Fourth and Third Streets.,On Friday the precinct released statistics supporting the claim that the Washington Square cameras had reduced crime. In 1997 -- the cameras were installed in November of that year -- there were 670 drug complaints and arrests inside the park. But in 1998, such complaints and arrests dropped to 99. Moreover, the cameras ''serve as a deterrent to all crime'' in the park, not just drug crimes, Sgt. James McGrath said.,Yet Sergeant McGrath also noted that the cameras pushed some crimes to other places. Indeed, the two new cameras are used mainly to monitor areas where the police said drug dealing has spread as a result of the 11 cameras at the park.,Such patterns concern Robert McDonald, who belongs to a group that has held marijuana rallies in the park. The cameras are like scarecrows, he said. ''They're not solving a problem, just moving it.'',But Richard Uviller, a criminal-law professor at Columbia University, suggested that moving crime around eventually reduced it. ''I don't think it's fair to say that it is a zero-sum game,'' he said.,Attendees at the hearing asked such questions as, Should signs be put up warning people of the cameras? How long should the police retain the tapes before erasing them?,Christopher Goeken, attorney for the New York Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence ProjecHt, said the cameras suggest ''this is not a place where you can feel comfortable walking down the street with your partner.'',But Lucy Cecere, director of a senior citizen center, said that before the cameras,  ''Our seniors could not go in the park. They were even confronted by drug dealers who would say, 'Try it, you'll love it.'

"There is no mistaking the no-frills Internet cafe near the corner of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues for its counterparts in grander neighborhoods. This is a place to explore cyberspace in coach class.,Roberto Alvarez, the lonely barista, said most customers prefer a 50-cent cup of joe to cappuccino. There is a television set on the wall over the food counter and a bulletproof shield in front of the cashier at the rear.,But among students at nearby Brooklyn College, ''there's a need for it,'' said Chris Lyn, a partner in True Choice Inc., which opened the cafe eight months ago. Though the college offers students free access to computers and the Internet, long waits are common, Mr. Lyn said.,His cafe has all the ambiance of a bus terminal, but in Mr. Lyn's view, it is a student's dream. ''Here,'' he said, ''you can watch a little cable.'',Demand for computer and Internet use has been somewhat lower than anticipated, he said, adding that he expected it to build. About five to seven students and local residents use the services at the site each day, which is open seven days a week, said Matilde Velez, an employee.,Mr. Lyn said he and his partners, Mike Santiago and Alan Rabinowitz, have been experimenting with prices, which are currently less of a bargain than the 75-cent hot dogs: $10 an hour for off-line computer time, $12 an hour for the Internet and $10 for a first page of scanning. The cafe also rents time for playing video games, and sells beepers, cellular phones and moneygrams.,The store's main business, however, is the sale of discounted phone cards. Signs in the window advertise bargain calling rates to the Caribbean, from which many local residents emigrated. Phone cards are also the principal draw at True Choice's three other stores in East Flatbush, which also offer the other products but not computer time.,''You always have people who are first,'' Mr. Lyn said when asked why his company had decided to introduce a concept associated with higher-income markets to East Flatbush.,The venture might earn the approval of Carolivia Herron, author of ''Nappy Hair,'' the book that offended some black parents when used by a teacher in Bushwick. Dr. Herron's current project is developing materials to help African-Americans and other minority groups get on line. If those groups participate more on the Internet, everyone benefits, she said.

"When Rachel Treichler says she is  planning to spend a lot of Greenbacks soon, she is not using slang. Ms. Treichler is the owner of Eco Books, which opened this month on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope and became the first retail store to accept Brooklyn Greenbacks, a local currency printed on recycled United States notes.,''We had to print more money'' when the bookstore began to participate, said Craig Seeman, a founder of the group of Green Party members and others that issues the currency. There is about $8,000 of the money, which was first issued in June 1997, in circulation, he said.,The currency ''is a way for local businesses to compete with the megastores,'' Mr. Seeman said. It is perfectly legal, he added.,Greenbacks are the coin of a fairly small realm, mostly downtown Brooklyn and Park Slope, with plans to expand into Bedford-Stuyvesant. About 150 participants use and accept them, mostly carpenters, computer consultants and other service providers, who employ them mainly to buy one another's labor.,Participants are listed in a directory. ''It should bring in customers and costs them nothing,'' Mr. Seeman said.,Upon signing up, individuals get the equivalent of $48 in Greenbacks,  free. They can call Mr. Seeman's office at 718-797-0045 to join, or go to Eco Books, between Union and Sackett Streets, on Saturdays.,Some vendors accept Greenbacks for partial payment. At Eco Books, whose entry into the Greenback economy was reported last week in The Park Slope Courier, customers can pay up to 10 percent of the purchase price in Greenbacks.,''We wouldn't expect a store to accept 100 percent Greenbacks for all items,'' said Mr. Seeman, because rent and inventory have to be paid for in regular dollars. But service providers often take them as full payment, he added.,Ms. Treichler, whose store specializes in environmental books, said she expected to hire bookkeepers from the group's list, as well as people to hand out fliers.,Once the first goody bag of Greenbacks is spent, the only way to get more is by offering goods or services. ''It's not for the person who thinks just as a consumer,'' Mr. Seeman said. Everyone lists a skill. A lawyer and an optician are on the list, as well as dog walkers.,The Greenbacks are modeled on the Ithaca Hours, a currency that has circulated in that upstate city since 1991 and has issued the equivalent of $67,000, said Paul Glover, a founder.

"A bureaucratic quagmire created by the Federal Government's gradual deeding of Fort Totten to the city has thwarted efforts to save several historically significant but neglected buildings, preservationists say.,Under an interim plan developed by the Fort Totten Redevelopment Authority, the city's Fire Department, which is building a training academy at the fort, is acting as temporary landlord. But groups like the Bayside Historical Society say the department is not the best steward of the three dozen empty Victorian and Queen Anne Revival houses that once were officers' homes.,This winter, water pipes ruptured in at least two unheated buildings, damaging plaster walls and warping wood floors. In other houses, porches with teetering, weather-battered columns and sagging or missing planks have been cordoned off with fencing or yellow tape that reads: ''Fire Line Do Not Cross.'',While much of the deterioration occurred before the Fire Department took the buildings over, the department has done little to stop further damage, the Bayside Historical Society says. ''The Fire Department's role is not historic preservation, it's saving lives,'' said the group's president, Geraldine Spinella.,Ten years ago, the Army let the society take over the former Officers Club and has spent $800,000 to restore the 1870 Gothic Revival building. It also wants to preserve two other dilapidated buildings: the 1904 Bachelor Officers' Quarters and the  1867 commandant's house.,At the commandant's home, gaping holes left by several broken windows and a collapsed chimney remain uncovered. The society recently tried to repair a badly cracked chimney atop the officers' residence, Ms. Spinella said, but members were told they needed liability insurance to enter. She said that because of suspected presence of asbestos in the building, the insurance cost was high and the group could not afford it.,''If it's not in yellow tape, it's in red tape,'' Ms. Spinella said. ''We all just wait while everything collapses.'',Peg Breen, president of the Landmarks Conservancy, said, ''Everyone wants to see these buildings maintained.'' But, she said, ''the overlapping jurisdictions have to be straightened out.'' The redevelopment authority is trying to resolve the problem, she said.,A Fire Department spokesman, Frank McCarton, said it has spent some $3 million since 1997 to heat, maintain and fix buildings at Fort Totten. ''It's probably in the best condition it has been in years,'' he said. ''We are doing the best that can to keep it up to par.'' He said the department would look into uncovered broken windows and apparent asbestos at two buildings, which he said were cordoned off as unsafe.,Dan Andrews, a spokesman for the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, the co-chairwoman of the fort's redevelopment authority, said the Fire Department had done a good job maintaining the grounds and making sure most pipes did not freeze. He emphasized that the department was an interim landlord during a ''cumbersome, bureaucratic procedure.'',Though the city has worked hard to get the process moving, it could take another year before the fort is fully conveyed to the city, said the executive director of the Historic House Trust, Scott P. Heyl. Ultimately, he said, the nonprofit group and the city's Parks Department will be responsible for the buildings.,''We are very concerned about the rapidly deteriorating conditions of the buildings,'' Mr. Heyl said, adding that he would push for the House Trust to take a more ''proactive'' role in stabilizing the houses ''sooner rather than later.''

"The curtain closes today on the most financially successful campaign in the history of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.,In this, its 87th year, the fund has raised $6,582,341.37 for seven of the oldest, most respected charities in New York City. Although the series ends today, the fund will continue to accept donations for the 1998-99 campaign, if  they are postmarked before March 3.,The fund's primary purpose has always been to raise money for New Yorkers in need. Yet this year, it has also performed other vital functions. Workers at the seven charities said that for many of the lost and forgotten of New York City, the fund has served as a spotlight.,''The fund tells the stories of New Yorkers who ordinarily get kicked into the corner or swept under the rug,'' said Judy Milone, director of client services at the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. ''The articles give them a voice, a face, and a presence in our discourse.'',Some of the once faceless Neediest Cases will get a chance to tell their stories once more. David Hilton, the formerly homeless teen-ager who got help through the UJA-Federation and became a prep school basketball star in Connecticut, is to appear on ''Good Morning America'' today.,Dawn Lopresti, the Iona College senior who is making an amazing comeback from brain trauma with the help of a charity supported by the UJA-Federation, will soon be featured in Mademoiselle magazine.,Ms. Lopresti's story also helped several other New York families learn where they could get assistance for relatives suffering from brain injuries. These New Yorkers called FEGS, formerly the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, and were directed to the appropriate programs.,Several other people interviewed for the Neediest Cases articles said they hoped that by telling their stories, they would guide other New Yorkers toward programs where they could be helped.,Miriam Vanterpool, the Bronx woman who is recovering from an attack in which her husband stabbed her nine times, has become an advocate for abused women. She publishes a bilingual newsletter on the subject, which the Jewish Board of Children's and Family Services helps to distribute throughout the Bronx. The board is supported by the UJA-Federation.,''I agreed to the interview because I want to warn people that they can get out before it's too late,'' Ms. Vanterpool said.,Her message may soon be transmitted through another medium: The Annie Liebowitz Studio has expressed interest in photographing Ms. Vanterpool for a book on American women.,For Victor Anrranco, the man who lost his arms due to severe burns suffered when he tried to repair a live wire in his neighborhood in Ecuador, the Neediest Cases Fund may have changed his life.,After the article on Mr. Anrranco appeared last week, several New Yorkers called the Catholic Community Center of Western Queens to pledge money so that Mr. Anrranco could get the financial help and prostheses that he needs. The community center, which is run by the Catholic Charities Diocese of Brooklyn, received $8,600 in donations, and an anonymous donor volunteered to pay whatever remaining medical costs Ms. Anrranco incurred.,Then, on Friday, a pair of orthotists from Long Island agreed to provide the prostheses for free. Leonard Butler of All Care Medical Products will provide the materials, and Anthony Cappa of C.P.O.

"BLAZERS 82, WIZARDS 81,Jim Jackson, starting in place of the suspended guard Isaiah Rider, sank a 21-foot jumper with 39.4 seconds remaining last night to give the Portland Trail Blazers an 82-81 road victory over the Washington Wizards.,The victory was the sixth in seven games for Portland and the third straight loss -- all at home -- for the Wizards, who blew a chance to win when Terry Davis missed a layup after a nice feed from Rod Strickland with 26 seconds to play.,The Trail Blazers got the rebound and ran out the clock.,Rider, the Blazers' leading scorer, was suspended without pay for one game and fined $2,500 by the National Basketball Association for leaving the bench during an altercation Friday night at Charlotte. He stayed at the team hotel and did not attend the game.,That gave Jackson his first start of the season, and he scored 13 points with 3 assists and 3 turnovers. Brian Grant, who had a double-double by halftime, led the Blazers with 19 points and 18 rebounds.,Grant put Portland ahead by  80-79 with 1 minute 23 seconds left when he muscled his way into the paint and had his hook rejected by Ben Wallace.

"LAKERS 99, CLIPPERS 83,Nine months off the basketball court has not done a thing to dull Dennis Rodman's rebounding instincts. His ability to snag loose balls with the zeal of a player half his age had the Los Angeles Lakers marveling at their 37-year-old wonder.,''I ain't going to be doing that at 37,'' the 26-year-old Shaquille O'Neal said. ''I can't say enough about how impressed I am.'',Rodman had 11 rebounds and 6 assists playing 26 minutes off the bench in his season debut Friday night as the Lakers beat the Clippers, 99-83 before a sellout crowd of 17,505 at the Forum.,Yesterday though, Rodman generated his first small controversy with the Lakers. He ran into some traffic and was late for practice at Los Angeles Southwest College.,''Supposedly he was about 10 minutes late,''  the Lakers spokesman John Black said last night. ''It was no big deal. He got caught in traffic. It was the same thing for me.'',Speaking after Friday night's game, Rodman said: I felt a little shy at the beginning because I didn't want to mess up, but when I stepped on the court it all just came back to me, he said.,Only Rodman could describe himself as shy. He certainly didn't look it, with tattoos snaking down his limbs and his famous hair dyed a muted mix of yellow, purple and black.,''It felt kind of awkward,'' said Rodman, who helped the Chicago Bulls win a sixth N.B.A. title last spring. ''In a weird way, I really didn't want to put on a Lakers uniform because I've been on three different teams and have been a winner on all three. Coming to the Lakers is just a different feel.'',Even though he kept the Lakers dangling for weeks, Rodman easily won them over. Especially O'Neal, who wasn't so friendly last spring when he and Rodman mocked each other publicly.,He gets a lot of loose balls,'' O'Neal said. That's what I've been looking for, a player like that. You really don't know how good people are until you get a chance to play with them. He's pretty good and he's pretty smart.,Rodman heaved a couple of 70-foot outlet passes to his teammates for baskets, but the new coach, Kurt Rambis, liked Rodman's defense.,We had virtually no work with him, but he's already communicating. He talks, said Rambis, announced as the replacement for Del Harris just two and a half hours before tip-off.

"WHEN President Reagan and Congress joined forces in the 1980's to overhaul the nation's income tax code, the political circumstances were similar to the situation now: divided government (then there was a Republican President and Senate and a Democratic House), a lame-duck President, an ideological gulf separating the parties, little public consensus about the proper legislative course and no particular crisis that required the President and Congress to take immediate action.,Yet the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was adopted anyway. Tax rates were cut almost in half.  Popular deductions were scrapped. Tax shelters were abolished. The taxes of virtually every person and business in America were affected by the new law.,The experience is relevant today because the monumental tax measure was the only law enacted in the last generation that approaches the sweeping scope of the Social Security legislation President Clinton and Congress are considering.,Here are some of the lessons from the odyssey of the tax law that politicians who are now working on the Social Security system might consider:,Real Bipartisanship Is More Than Just Talk.,President Reagan, the genial Republican patriarch, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the bare-knuckle brawler from the Chicago Democratic machine, had little in common and no use for one another personally. But they shared the conviction that the tax system was out of whack and needed revision.,The evening Mr. Reagan announced his tax plan in a nationally televised speech, Mr. Rostenkowski, then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, went on the air to praise the President and urge viewers to ''write Rosty'' if they agreed. Not once in the 18 months between then and the day the measure was signed into law did either man publicly criticize the other.,In the Senate, when the tax measure seemed to unravel totally, it was put back together again, outside the public eye, by a small group consisting of the President's agent, Richard G. Darman, and seven senators -- four Republicans and three Democrats.,Nowadays, the bad blood and mistrust may be insurmountable, even though President Clinton and Republican leaders have proclaimed their fealty to bipartisanship almost every day since the impeachment trial ended.,Republicans are already accusing the White House of dishonest accounting practices. Clinton supporters have been quick to charge the Republicans with wanting to jeopardize retirement benefits by giving tax cuts to the wealthy. Badly burned every time they have touched Social Security in the past, Republican Congressional leaders worry that the President would rather have a campaign issue than a law.,When Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called the White House recently to ask to see the President one-on-one to talk about Social Security, he was told the time was not ripe.,Political Leadership Can Mean Wheeling and Dealing.,In 1985, at the outset of the tax debate, President Reagan transferred James A. Baker 3d and Mr. Darman, the two most talented political maestros on the White House staff, to the Treasury Department, made them Secretary and Deputy Secretary and put them in charge of the drive for tax reform.,Mr. Darman developed what he called ''the principle of binary choice.'' If a few key politicians had a personal stake, he reasoned, and if the rank and file in Congress were given only ''a binary choice between tax reform and no tax reform,'' a sweeping tax bill could pass against all odds.,That is exactly what happened. Over and over between early 1985 and late 1986, when the most thorough revision of the tax code in at least 40 years was enacted, the legislation itself was essentially dead. But each time it was revived because central figures like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Rostenkowski and Senators Bill Bradley and Bob Packwood were personally committed and because other lawmakers had no alternative but to vote for whatever measure was before them at the time or to kill altogether the idea of changing the tax system.,In the House, Mr. Rostenkowski was in total command. On the morning of the House vote, he was on the telephone in his committee's library calling lawmakers and lining up their votes. He promised, for instance, special tax breaks for a stadium in Cleveland, a parking garage in Memphis, a convention center in Miami and dozens of other projects. ''Politics is an imperfect process,'' he explained at the time.,Today, no one in the Clinton Administration has nearly the political skill and influence in Congress that Mr. Baker and Mr. Darman had. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has not taken a leading role on Social Security, and in any event, he may leave his post by this summer.,In Congress, the iron-fisted rule and conspicuous logrolling for which Mr. Rostenkowski was famous is out of fashion. It makes for cleaner government, but legislative accomplishment is harder.,If Goals Are Agreed On, The Details Can Be Worked Out,The individual pieces of the tax law that was eventually enacted bore little relationship to what President Reagan proposed or, for that matter, what came out of Mr. Rostenkowski's committee. The tax brackets were different. Investors lost their tax break on capital gains. Deductions of state and local income taxes were permitted, but those for medical expenses were restricted. Real estate tax shelters were ended. On balance, taxes on businesses went up, and those on families went down.,Brutal battles were fought over such details. But the basic goals were never in dispute: lower tax rates, fewer deductions, no change in the amount of revenue raised, no shift in the relative tax burden on the rich and the middle class. At issue was who the winners and losers would be within that framework.,In the case of Social Security, both sides agree on the basic goal: sufficient money must be found to provide an acceptable standard of living to baby boomers when they retire. But so far, neither President Clinton nor the Republicans who control Congress have conceded that reaching that goal will result in losers as well as winners. Some workers will pay higher taxes; some retirees will get reduced benefits.,So the debate so far has been over details like whether income-tax revenues should be used to pay retirement benefits and who should control payroll taxes invested in the stock market.,Those are important questions. But even if they are resolved, the basic goal will remain elusive.",DAVID E. ROSENBAUM,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Nation: Then and Now; How to Pass a Great Big Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/the-nation-then-and-now-how-to-pass-a-great-big-law.html
"HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON said last year that a Palestinian state was ''very important'' to Middle East peace, and it seemed like a monumental political gaffe. Many Jewish groups reacted with alarm. And her husband's Administration, which has never endorsed the idea, swiftly disowned her comments.,Now, after 10 months, Mrs. Clinton's words are back on the front pages of New York City's Jewish newspapers, thanks to the First Lady's announcement that she is thinking about running for the Senate from the Empire State next year.,One of her potential Republican rivals, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, has stoked the controversy, asserting that Mrs. Clinton's remarks were ''a very big mistake.'' And analysts are already predicting that the First Lady's position on Palestinian statehood will hurt her among Jewish voters, about 12 percent of the state's electorate.,But it's not necessarily so. A Palestinian state is not the same hot-button issue it was 10, or even 5 years ago, when endorsing the concept was akin in some peoples' minds to endorsing terrorism, many political analysts and Jewish leaders say.,''The Palestinian state is no longer the taboo subject it once was,'' said Thomas Smerling, Washington director of the Israel Policy Forum, an American Jewish group that supports the peace process. ''At a time when you have a Likud Prime Minister negotiating with the Chairman of the P.L.O. over the size of an eventual Palestinian entity, the idea of a Palestinian state no longer seems as alarming as it once did.'',Many Jewish leaders say that since Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization recognized each other's legitimacy in 1993, a growing number of Jews in America and Israel have come to accept that some sort of Palestinian state will be the likely outcome of a negotiated peace process.,Several polls of American Jews conducted over the past three years support that notion. A 1998 poll commissioned by the Middle East Quarterly found that 64 percent of American Jews supported the statement, ''The Palestinians should have their own country.'',But even if most American Jews believe a Palestinian state is desirable, or inevitable, Mrs. Clinton's statement could still cause her grief in a New York campaign. Many Jews were troubled not so much by the wording of Mrs. Clinton's remarks as by their timing. From Washington, she spoke up in the middle of sensitive peace talks between Israel and Palestinians. To many, weighing in at that moment seemed a crass attempt to push the talks toward a conclusion favoring the Palestinians.,''Many Jews viewed her statement as supporting a unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians, or at least granting Arafat a license to do it,'' said Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, referring to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.,But Mr. Foxman also acknowledged that ''the overwhelming number of Jews would be supportive'' of a Palestinian state if it were the result of a negotiated settlement. ''It's Israel's peace,'' he said.,I N a sign that she is serious about becoming a candidate, Mrs. Clinton has been trying to repair any damage from her remarks. Meeting with rabbis last week in Washington, she said she supported both the peace process and a Palestinian state. ''They are not mutually exclusive of one another,'' her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said.,After the meeting, Rabbi Jay Kornsgold of New Jersey told the newspaper Jewish Week, ''This may impress a lot of Jews in New York.'',IF supporting a Palestinian state is no longer the third rail of Jewish-American politics, what might Mr. Giuliani or other Republicans gain from keeping the issue alive?,A significant number of Jews continue to oppose a Palestinian state. But they tend to be conservatives who vote Republican anyway. It is more likely that Mr. Giuliani was using the Palestinian issue as a symbol for broader themes, political analysts said.,Raising questions about Mrs. Clinton's remarks is a way of raising doubts about her support for Israel, said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican consultant from New York. It also is another way of labeling her a liberal ideologue, said Ester Fuchs, a political science professor at Barnard College.,''Supporting a Palestinian state used to be the peacenik position, an extreme left-wing position,'' she said. ''And that's what Giuliani has to do: Paint his opponent into a left-wing corner.'',Mr. Giuliani says he has simply taken the same position as the President, who is very popular among Jews. But in helping to keep the issue alive, he risks a backlash, some analysts contend. Last year, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato accused Charles E. Schumer, who is Jewish, of missing votes on important Jewish issues. Mr. D'Amato lost the race and saw his share of the Jewish vote decline from past elections.,''I'm not sure the Mayor has the pulse of American Jewish opinion on this issue,'' said Seymour D. Reich, a past chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and a supporter of the peace process.",JAMES DAO,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Nation; New York's Palestinian State,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/the-nation-new-york-s-palestinian-state.html
"A woman suffering from breast cancer asks for a bone marrow transplant. Her health plan says no. A paraplegic needs a special wheelchair to achieve adequate mobility. The plan says no. Rarely a week goes by without a health maintenance organization getting hammered in the press or in court for denying payment for the care of a gravely ill patient. Clearly, the anecdotal evidence suggests, the scandal of managed care is rampant denial of treatment.,But guess again. The media, courts and consumer advocates are overlooking a problem that is precisely the opposite of the one everybody's complaining about. That problem is too many medical treatments rather than too few.,For a variety of reasons -- fears of consumer backlash, legislative intervention or large jury awards -- managed care plans appear to be denying little care, notwithstanding all the well-publicized horror stories and growing complaints as H.M.O.'s become commonplace in American society.,As a result, the cost savings that H.M.O.'s have already achieved are in jeopardy. Managed care also is not meeting its stated goal of improving the quality of treatment by second-guessing physicians who fail to follow the best medical practices.,Take a look at figures on care denial that New York and other states are just beginning to collect. While incomplete and problematic, they suggest that there have been few denials over the objections of enrollees or their doctors, raising the question of whether the persistent reports of callous behavior by H.M.O.'s provide a distorted picture.,For example, New York for the first time in 1997 required health plans to report each time patients or their physicians appealed a plan's denial of reimbursement for a physician-approved treatment. The plans reported a small number of appeals.,The Oxford Health Plans, covering more than a million New Yorkers in managed care, reported fewer than 1.5 appeals for every 1,000 enrollees. The six largest managed care plans in the state averaged about 2.5 appeals per 1,000 patients.,Mainly, the H.M.O.'s denied coverage for specialists not part of the plan's network of physicians; treatments deemed unnecessary for a patient's recovery, and procedures that the plan deemed experimental -- lacking scientific evidence of safety or effectiveness.,A similar picture emerges from reports in other states. New Jersey and Connecticut, for example, keep track of appeals that are not resolved by the internal procedures of managed-care plans -- a smaller category than that reported for New York. For 1998, New Jersey reported 69 such appeals from about 2.5 million enrollees in managed care. Connecticut reported 39 appeals from about a million enrollees. Appeals are rare even in managed care plans serving Medicare, despite the fact that appeals are automatic once the enrollee has exhausted the plan's internal review. Managed care patients in general win between a quarter to a third of their appeals to Federal and state authorities.,Could there be too few denials?  Don't snicker. A Presidential commission recently concluded that excessive procedures -- procedures that lack scientific justification -- could account for as much as 30 percent of the nation's medical bills. Surgeons perform mastectomies rather than breast-preserving surgery on Medicare patients 35 times more often in some parts of the country than in others, for no apparent medical reason. Roughly a quarter of the surgeries to implant tubes in children's ears are inappropriate.,There is, says Professor Alain Enthoven of Stanford University, an ''urgent need for managed care to second-guess decisions by physicians to subject patients to needlessly risky surgery and needlessly costly tests.'',Critics dismiss the self-reported New York data as unverified and unreliable. It is true that plans use different definitions of appeals and other grievances. Nor did some of the plans submit internally consistent or complete reports.,And it's not entirely clear how to interpret the low number of reported appeals. Most enrollees are healthy and present no occasion to deny care. Many denials never get appealed because patients give up easily or are unaware of legal options.,But before dismissing the data, take a close look at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. It reported twice as many appeals, about 38 per 1,000 patients, as any other plan, and about 15 times as many appeals as the largest plans. Upon re-examination, Empire has determined that it exaggerated the actual number because its accounting system tossed in non-medical complaints like protests of premium increases. When corrected, Empire says, its reported appeals will plummet. But is even its exaggerated estimate -- 7,300 appeals for about 200,000 patients -- an excessive figure?,A number of medical directors of large health plans say in private that fear of consumer and legal backlash has scared them from denying reimbursement even when they are convinced the treatment is ill advised. Dr. Gordon Norman of PacifiCare of California, a large managed care plan, points to another problem: ''Doctors often prefer to bend to the wishes of patients, agreeing to request diagnostic tests or procedures that they may not feel are truly necessary.'' The doctors put the onus on the health plan to deny their requests, leaving them ''in good graces with their patients, but making the plan look like the bad guy.'',Aetna U.S. Healthcare identifies another way health plans keep the number of denials and appeals low.  Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, Aetna's medical director, calls it a ''sentinel'' effect, by which his staff keeps physicians well informed about Aetna's standards. Critics might call this bullying physicians to cut costs. That is no doubt part of the story.,But Dr. Leibowitz defends Aetna's practices by pointing to a side of managed care that the public rarely sees. It is the side that focuses on raising quality. It often tells doctors to do more, not less.,BESIDES pointing out ways doctors do too much, research also exposes ways they do too little. Physicians often fail to prescribe life-saving beta-blockers for heart attack victims or proper inhalers for asthma patients. Aetna issues reports to its doctors tracing how their care stacks up against their peers.,Empire made available short accounts of appeals for the first eight months of 1998. The names of the patients were stricken, though Empire contacted a random sample of the patients to ask whether they would take follow-up phone calls from a reporter. The picture that emerges is murky.,Empire refers appeals about experimental treatments like bone marrow transplants to outside panels of independent experts. That has virtually eliminated contentious legal challenges of this type of denial, raising the possibility that external review might blunt some of the consumer backlash over managed care. But Empire's other denials trigger a tug-of-war between a plan that tries to control costs and supervise care, and patients who demand the freedom to get the care they want.,Many of Empire's cases lie in a gray zone. Empire tells of financially strapped patients who skip paying premiums, then get hit with crushing medical bills. Employers switch health insurers, forcing employees to switch to Empire's doctors -- a traumatic experience for many chronically ill patients. One parent refused to take her child, who suffered from speech and other development problems, to a doctor who had once screamed at her, triggering nightmares. Empire agreed to let the child see any other doctor in the same medical office, but the parent balked. In another case, a patient insisted on seeing a physical therapist who, she decided for unspecified reasons, was uniquely qualified to treat her back problems. Empire overturns about 30 percent of its initial denials, often after physicians produce better evidence.,The point is not that managed care does not make callous medical decisions and aggravate patients. Even if appeals are infrequent, complaints to state officials about managed care are rising, though some of the trend can be explained by rising enrollment in managed care plans, and many of the complaints involve nuisances like not answering the phone quickly or paying claims on time.,Managed care plans sometimes deny care when they should not, and sometimes pay for care when they should not. Both mistakes pose dangers. Mr. Enthoven offers a caution. ''The country risks making a terrible mistake if it overreacts and treats every denial as an assault on patients,'' he said. ''Denials are a necessary feature of a well-run plan.''",MICHAEL M.

"DEMOCRATS, who have not run Nassau County in three decades, sense an opportunity in the problems plaguing the county's Republican leadership. But many party leaders are worried that they will be unable to mount a credible challenge for control of the  Legislature and the county executive's office unless they get their own house in order.,The trouble starts at the top, with the fraud and perjury trial of the county Democratic Party chairman, Stephen Sabbeth. Mr. Sabbeth, who says he is innocent, has refused to resign or accept a temporary suspension while his case is being heard.,Even as a jury in Federal District Court in Hauppauge prepared to deliberate Mr. Sabbeth's fate, all five Democrats in the County Legislature were moving last week to oust him from his $104,000 job as Nassau's Democratic Elections Commissioner. Democrats have also been maneuvering to replace him as party chairman, a post he has held since 1994.,Mr. Sabbeth insisted that even if convicted, he would remain in both offices until all his appeals are exhausted. But some key Nassau Democrats said last week that no matter what the verdict, Mr. Sabbeth's days in the two pivotal posts are numbered.,''The battle is not predicated on what the Federal court will do but on what is good for the Democratic Party and the people of Nassau County,'' said Jay S. Jacobs of Woodbury, who twice unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Sabbeth for the chairmanship.,Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli of Great Neck has offered to serve as interim party chairman, but only if Mr. Sabbeth stepped aside. ''There is no vacancy in the office and I'm not sitting on the phone lining up support,'' he said.,Mr. DiNapoli pointed out that Mr. Sabbeth's term as party leader expires in September and that unless he resigns, ''you can't end it prematurely. There is no provision for throwing someone out.'',He insisted the Democrats ''needed to get organized and deliver issues and candidates from neighborhoods, not back rooms. The party has become a battle over the Board of Elections job, a small group of people trying to control a few patronage jobs.'',Mr. Jacobs and others also acknowledged that moves to dump Mr. Sabbeth would undoubtedly face a court challenge, delaying efforts to campaign against Nassau Republicans when they are most vulnerable.,''We have not had an opportunity like this since I don't recall when,'' said Lewis Yevoli, a former Oyster Bay Supervisor who ran against County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta in 1997.,He pointed to the county's huge budget shortfall, the scandal surrounding its decision to switch health insurance plans, allegations of brutality at the Nassau County Jail and the public backlash against Republicans stemming from the impeachment trial in Washington.,''The Republicans have brought the county to the brink of bankruptcy,'' Mr. Yevoli said. ''We have a distinct possibility of capturing another five seats in the County Legislature next November, which would give us control.'',Republicans, who hold a 3-2 enrollment edge in the county, now hold 14 of the 19 seats in the Legislature. Two of three town supervisors are Republicans and all of them face re-election in November. And Democrats also are viewing the county executive's seat as highly winnable when Mr. Gulotta's term expires in 2001.,But Bruce Nyman of Long Beach, the Legislature's minority leader, cautioned: ''We have been known to shoot ourselves in the foot before. The last time there was a budget crisis in the county in 1993, Ben Zwirn came close to becoming county executive. Some say our own problems kept him from winning and that it will happen again.'',Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat and Mayor of Glen Cove, voiced similar concerns.,''We're a wreck,'' he said of the party. ''Everybody is fighting with one another instead of focusing our energies on solving the problems of the people of Nassau County. Things are so bad for the Republicans now that, if we had good candidates who were credible, understood politics and could build an organization with people and money, we could win several legislative seats. If we can't win them now, we can't win.'',Among the Republican seats targeted is the First Legislative District, currently held by Darlene D. Harris of Uniondale. Mr. Nyman said she has twice won that seat in a heavily Democratic area because one Democrat got the party endorsement and another popular Democrat ran as an independent. But he said he is confident that only one Democrat would run this year.,Another seat the Democrats believe is winnable is the Fifth Legislative District, held by Thomas Glynn of Rockville Centre. The Republicans are vulnerable there, Mr. Nyman said, because they denied Rockville Centre and other villages a share of the $700 million in sales taxes collected in the county.,''If we can get at least seven Democrats on the Legislature, that would give us veto power over many of the fiscal proposals that the Legislature has to pass,'' Mr. Nyman said. ''We would be able to block bond issues and borrowing.'',In an interview during a break in his trial, Mr. Sabbeth said that recent election returns demonstrated that Nassau voters are prepared to bolt their party given an attractive Democratic candidate. He said Carolyn McCarthy of Mineola, who in November was re-elected to Congress, was one example. He said the number of elected Democrats has risen from 17 in 1990 to 38 today.,''I and the Democrats have the ability to raise money and get our message out,'' Mr. Sabbeth said. ''We saw that clearly in the statewide election last year when we beat Al D'Amato on the Democratic versus Republican lines. And we beat Bruce Blakeman by 30,000 votes.'',Mr. Blakeman, the presiding officer of the Nassau Legislature, was running for state comptroller. Mr. D'Amato was running for re-election to the Senate.,Asked whether his trial had hurt the Democrats, Mr. Sabbeth said: ''I think it hasn't had any effect. You should be judged by your accomplishments, and this has been a banner year.,''I don't think the Democratic Party has ever been stronger,'' he said. ''We raised close to $300,000 last year, 10 times as much as my predecessor. During my tenure, we raised close to $2 million.'',But Mr. Jacobs said ost of that money must have gone to consultants.,''Talk to anyone in the Legislature and ask how much they got,'' he said. ''They got 50 bumper stickers and 500 palm cards, if they were lucky. For him to claim that he had anything to do with the success of any Democratic candidate in Nassau County is a fabrication and an insult.'',Lisanne Altmann, a Democratic county legislator from Great Neck, said the party never helped her in her two elections. But she said that even without the party's help, the Republicans are so vulnerable this year that Democrats should be able to capture more legislative seats if they act quickly.,''It's like a moon shot where there is a window of opportunity that is going to close,'' she said. ''If we don't solve the Sabbeth situation quickly, we might lose it.'',Mr. Zwirn, who is in his family's confectionery business, said he also believes the Democrats need a strong leader ''to maintain unity and discipline and keep disagreements below the surface, like the Republicans.'',He criticized Mr. Sabbeth for holding both the party chairmanship position and the post of elections commissioner, something Mr. Sabbeth had criticized his predecessor, John Matthews, for doing. And Mr. Zwirn said Mr. Sabbeth was ineffective in getting candidates elected.,Mr. Jacobs said that he and many elected Democratic officials in the county have been working quietly to find good candidates and develop a fund-raising plan apart from Mr. Sabbeth and his followers.,''We're going to fight for every inch of Nassau County,'' he said. ''We are going to yield nothing to Mondello and the Republicans.'',Joseph Mondello is the Nassau Republican Party chairman. Anthony J. Santino, Mr. Mondello's executive assistant, insisted that his party is gearing up for the challenge.,''This is a ballgame and it's only the second inning,'' he said. ''We have a long way to go. The Republican Party has good candidates with a good message and a track record of performance. We have a strong following. We're going to be working very hard and taking nothing for granted. We're going to run a strong race everywhere. They are counting their chickens well before they are hatched.'',But Mr. Nyman insisted that ''Republican mismanagement is bigger than any of our self-imposed Democratic problems. We are going to keep our eyes on the ball long enough to unify ourselves, because if we can't win a couple of seats this year, we won't create the momentum for the county executive race in 2001.''",STEWART AIN,"FEB. 28, 1999","Nassau Democrats Primed for Inroads, but Have Own Problems",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/nassau-democrats-primed-for-inroads-but-have-own-problems.html
"GRANDPARENTS rule. There never was a time before when American composers of classical music were so old: Elliott Carter, Henry Brant, Milton Babbitt, George Perle, Lou Harrison, Leon Kirchner, Ralph Shapey and Gunther Schuller count among the most venturesome creative musicians of the present day, all of them going strong at ages ranging down to 73. The definition of ''young composer'' in this context has to be someone still under 50, and so far there are not too many high achievers among them, as a listener was reminded at the recent Focus festival of the Juilliard School, ''Toward the Millennium, Part 1.'',If we look back, say, 40 years, the contrast is alarming. Every one of the composers mentioned above had already established a reputation (though Mr. Carter, even then, was over the 50 limit), and we could add to the list people who have since died but were, in 1959, under 50 and nationally, even internationally, prominent: Cage, Bernstein, Barber, Morton Feldman, Irving Fine, Mel Powell, Ben Weber, Hugo Weisgall.,All these composers, those now elderly and those deceased, were probably stimulated by growing up at a time when American music was kicking itself into action: the period of the country's rise, more generally, in international power and prestige. As far as music was concerned, the center of gravity was shifting. American jazz and popular music were sweeping Europe, and some of Europe's most important classical composers were coming here, notably Schoenberg and Stravinsky. They had an influence, for sure, but they were also changed by America, and after the war, American composers went back to have a powerful effect on Europe: Cage and Mr. Carter in the 50's, Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the 70's.,Now our young, under-50 composers are unplayed in Europe and unregarded. This inattention must have something to do with the decline in American cultural authority abroad since the end of the cold war, but it is also a response to a lack of interesting ideas coming from this side of the Atlantic. Or perhaps those are linked phenomena, in that American artists may have been unsettled by uncertainty as to the country's role in the world, an uncertainty that may be much more confusing than the downright opposition to the Government that many adopted in the Nixon and Johnson eras. American music was always most typically outgoing, embracing. Now nobody in the world outside wants or needs to be embraced.,Another important difference for younger composers today is that they have had to work in a world where the dominant musical style is rock. The music Mr. Reich, Mr. Glass and others began to produce around 1970 is best seen not as a reaction against complexity within the classical tradition, nor even as a response to Asian and African music, but rather as a last attempt on behalf of classical music to abstract elements of rock without stylistic compromise. For them, classical music was still at the center and could hope to absorb rock, rather as, in previous ages, it had absorbed the minuet and the waltz. Admittedly, the means were extreme. A lot of classical music's intricacy had to be abandoned. But the superiority of the high culture was never in question.,That confidence has gone. Rock music does not need to be assimilated and memorialized by classical composers; through recordings, it has its own means of being remembered. And its lesser status is not at all to be taken for granted. Since rock has no use for would-be developers, classical music's powers of assimilation have been stemmed, and with them, its opportunities for growth. To be sure, a lot of classical composers have simply taken over rock's basic elements of pulsation and symmetry, but so have a lot of Broadway musicians, with results no more compelling.,Another factor at work here, no doubt, is current suspicion with regard to cultural hybridization. Valuing above all the authentic, contemporary culture seeks to keep traditions separate for as long as possible and thus makes it difficult for composers to learn from elsewhere. Instead, they are asked to explore their own roots, and a lot of time has been wasted. Artists cannot avoid their roots; anything they make will speak of themselves and of their inheritance. The interesting things have often happened when people have looked radically outside their own backgrounds: LaMonte Young studying Indian singing, John Cage reading Zen, Steve Reich playing African drums.,Any such endeavors now have to confront intellectual barriers founded on a false and unhelpful notion of ownership, and though, happily, there are still wall-jumpers around, they generally have to stay on the margins. Maybe it is there, on the fenced borderlands between classical and other traditions (rock, klezmer, gamelan), that the most valuable music of the next century will start to emerge. For the moment, though, the energy has gone out of downtown music, which was essentially an oppositional movement, and which has nothing to oppose now that professional composers have given up their claim to be authoritative.,Meanwhile, those professional composers, well inside the classical tradition, must work with what they find at home. Since this does not now include the finger of history resolutely pointing the way forward -- for the avant-garde movement began coming to a halt as soon as Cage wrote his silent piece, in 1952 -- no one should be surprised that the leading style of the last 20 years has been pastiche.,Even so, it is odd that nearly all younger composers should feel compelled to recycle the masters of the mid-20th century rather than those of any other epoch. Such recycling is sometimes justified, or at least explained, as being audience-friendly, though there is little evidence that the audience feels particularly friendly in return.,Also, pastiche is by nature ephemeral. Instead of constructing in stone, many composers are happily building sand castles to be washed away by the evening tide, and perhaps in doing so, they are simply being realistic. Despite active commissioning of new work, and performance of it by major orchestras and opera companies, the core repertory goes on from decade to decade unchanged. Composers are now bound to face the fact that their labors are unlikely to outlast a first performance.,Something else that has changed since the 50's is that classical music has lost its almost automatic eminence in the culture and its place in the educational system. No longer does any college student have at least a recording of Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons.'' The most regular contact people today have with a classical orchestra -- probably even if they are symphony subscribers -- is through the medium of the film score, where music rarely has a chance to grow beyond the obligation to enhance emotional atmosphere. There must be some link here with the debased Romanticism so much in favor among younger composers.,Only the old, who matured in more confident times, seem able to create music of expression springing from structural energy, music made to last -- even if the old, too, have been affected by retrenchment -- and the American works of the last decade that look to be most resilient are those of our most senior composers: Elliott Carter's ''Symphonia,'' Milton Babbitt's many chamber-music gems. Grandparents rule. But soon the grandparents will be gone.,American Young Lions,Here are some of the brighter lights among the younger American composers on the scene today.,DAVID LANG -- The dominant creative talent in the Bang on a Can group, he is capable of going way off beam (''Modern Masters,'' his opera on John Ruskin) but also of hitting home. The sound may often be aggressive, but the intensity is real, and the music has a mind as well as a hammer. His music can be heard on various Bang on a Can anthologies from Composers Recordings and Sony Classical, but important recordings -- notably, Steven Schick's of the percussion solo ''Anvil Chorus'' -- are no longer available.,STEVEN MACKEY -- A composer with a wild imagination and often a keen sense of humor, he is perplexingly underrepresented on record. His solo album, on Bridge, offers pieces for electric and acoustic guitars, including ''Cairn,'' a memorial made of gentle appeals and somber rippling sounds, and ''Lost and Found,'' a darting and sonorous counterpointing of Renaissance music and rock.,AUGUSTA READ THOMAS -- Big orchestral works show off her strengths: boldness mixed with sophistication, energetic lyricism and a somewhat Franco-American style of subtle and occasionally eerie coloring. Titles are another strong suit. An album in the Louisville Orchestra's First Edition series includes her Triple Concerto, which has the subtitle ''Night's Midsummer Blaze'' and confronts the trio of flute, viola and harp, for which she writes exquisitely, with surprisingly vociferous music for symphony orchestra.,JOHN ZORN -- He is so prolific and so various a musician that any quick characterization will have to await the Zorn scholars of the 21st century. Styles -- rock and classical -- are often freely thrown together, without intimidating expertise. Recordings of all kinds are available on his own Tzadik label, one of whose recent releases is his ''Aporias,'' a piano concerto whose multifarious strands include Messiaen, Varese and boy choristers.,LEE HYLA -- His CD ''We Speak Etruscan,'' on New World, contains music of compelling frustration, swerving between a mania of reiterative patterns that fit intricately together and a wistful meditative gloom. The works, all instrumental and neatly scored, include two string quartets and a piano concerto, as well as the title piece, rubbing together bass clarinet and baritone sax.,STEPHEN HARTKE -- Beautiful craftsmanship is his hallmark but not his limitation: the imaginative drive is fresh, partly in being so playful, though he can also be solemn. A disk of his orchestral music, on New World, includes his Violin Concerto, which starts with New York liveliness and ends with a Shetland Islands lament, and his Second Symphony, which again mixes moods but finishes slow.,GERALD LEVINSON -- A new CD, preferably including his Second Symphony, is needed to supplement his first album, on Composers Recordings. That disk includes one major work -- ''Dreamlight,'' for cello, piano and percussion -- which demonstrates his ability to create whole and convincing musical worlds between Western soul-searching and Oriental (Balinese) joy. It also includes ''Black Magic/White Magic,'' which shows off his inventive orchestral writing.,AARON JAY KERNIS -- Manifestly skillful in everything he touches, which is a great deal, he has moved in the 90's toward nightmare scenarios, whose expression is vivid, even lurid. The saving grace is his inability to be entirely comfortable with the grand gesture; often the real music is in the cunning surroundings and accompaniments, as in his English-horn concerto, ''Colored Field,'' coupled with his piano quartet, ''Still Movement With Hymn,'' on Argo.

"WHEN Andy Warhol began painting Campbell's Soup cans nearly four decades ago, it wasn't long before Pop Art became accepted as the Next Big Thing in the world of fine arts. The newest development in a modernist tradition that had already absorbed the shocks of Cubism, Dadaism and Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art was quickly recognized as a movement ready made for museum catalogues, history books and skyrocketing auction prices.,But if you turn the words Pop Art around and apply them to music, suddenly you have a debate about cultural values and hierarchy, about entertainment and art, that has never been fully resolved. The heart of that debate is a dialogue about the esthetic worth of the primitive versus the refined, an oral tradition versus a written one, spontaneity versus craft, populist versus highbrow and European versus American. Or as the rock critic Robert Christgau, a populist and leftist intellectual, declared in an essay on Chuck Berry: ''Unless we can somehow recycle the concept of the great artist so that it supports Chuck Berry as well as it does Marcel Proust, we might as well trash it altogether.'',The music that is loosely defined as art-pop -- music as diverse as that of Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel, Laurie Anderson, Beck, Pavement and Duncan Sheik -- doesn't have much to do with Mr. Berry's raw, euphoric synthesis of blues and country music. But Mr. Berry's role as a founding father of rock-and-roll and a maker of hybrids certainly paved the way for its development.,Generally speaking, the term art-pop refers to any pop style that consciously aspires to the formal values of classical music and poetry. At the same time, most art-pop is underwritten and marketed not by staid cultural institutions but by commercially voracious record companies who tout even the silliest, most juvenile acts as ''recording artists.'' All but the most stubbornly highbrow critics would probably agree that the mingling of pop and classical has had a genuinely liberating influence on music. But at what point does the convergence of so many musical streams muddy the water so thoroughly that distinctions of quality begin to vanish in an undifferentiated muck?,Many people would date the birth of art-pop to the mid-1960's when the Beatles first recorded with a string quartet and producers like Phil Spector and the Beach Boys' leader, Brian Wilson, brought a quasi-symphonic (or ''Wagnerian,'' as rock critics were fond of calling Mr. Spector's Wall of Sound productions) textures to pop recording.,After the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' established the so-called concept album as pop music's dominant format in 1967, rock bands of every stripe churned out albums (and even ''operas'' like the Who's ''Tommy'') that linked songs into suites and aspired to make grand artistic statements. A bombastic, classically inflected post-Beatles art-rock flourished, especially in England, whence came the Moody Blues; Pink Floyd; Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Yes; Genesis; Electric Light Orchestra; Procol Harum, and other bands.,Because of the influence of Bob Dylan and the Beats, North American art-pop took a more literary path through folk music in the singer-songwriter movement that produced Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen and Laura Nyro. Fusing Beat and confessional poetry with assorted musical hybrids, these artists chose the long-playing record instead of print as the medium for evoking a generation's collective experience. Mr. Dylan is today a certified cultural deity, while Ms. Mitchell immodestly likes to compare her importance to that of Picasso and Van Gogh.,As the generational wars of the late 1960's and 70's cooled, older pop styles were re-examined and canonized. Frank Sinatra, once viewed as a kitsch pop crooner, is today exalted as a great American artist who invented ''personal'' singing. Four decades before the Beatles recorded ''Yesterday,'' George Gershwin aspired to write highbrow music with a populist pulse. Even earlier, Scott Joplin's ragtime piano balanced a Mozartean order against the raunch of a New Orleans brothel. Gershwin and Duke Ellington, who emerged from the worlds of Broadway and jazz, have eclipsed Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein as American musical patriarchs.,Vintage Broadway scores have been dusted off and ''elevated'' in recordings featuring opera singers, and classically trained vocalists from Dawn Upshaw to Bryn Terfel have applied their talents to albums of popular standards. For her first solo album, the gifted Broadway mezzo-soprano Audra McDonald chose to record songs by young composers whose work thoroughly blurs the line between Broadway pop and classical art song.,To the diehard rock-and-rollers who championed punk rock's surge as a purifying fire, the upward mobility of non-rock styles is no cause for celebration, especially at a moment when rock has been commercially eclipsed by hip-hop and country and eroded by a tentative swing revival.,The same advancing technology that played a crucial role in the birth of rock with the near-simultaneous development of electric instruments, high fidelity and the long-playing record has contributed to the music's decline. By turning promotional materials into product, the music video undermined rock's integrity, subsuming the music to the values of television. In supplanting the LP, the compact disk, with its increased length, hastened the demise of the concept album, which couldn't comfortably support a song cycle longer than about 45 minutes. And as the world became more of a global village, music with few ties to Europe or the United States further called into question musical hierarchies both here and abroad. Meanwhile, a younger generation, turning its back on its parents, chose computers instead of music as its preferred mode of conversation.,Where a generation ago, rock critics and record companies announced the arrival of a new ''masterpiece'' every month or two, mainstream pop has reverted to the detached consumerist ethic of the pre-Beatles era. Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys rule, and audience loyalty to a new act rarely extends beyond one or two records. As for art-pop, the radio formats that sell records leave little room for sounds that don't conform to strict niche-market formulas.,But each year, great claims are still made for one or another promising performer. This year's recipient of hype is the talented pop-hip-hopper Lauryn Hill, who has been described as having Roberta Flack's voice and Joni Mitchell's songwriting gift. As enticing as that may sound, it's simply not true in either department. Not yet, at least.,As for the anti-establishment cultural war led by rock-and-roll, it was won hands down by rock in the mid-1970's. Beethoven and Proust have since rolled over in their graves many times and told Tchaikovsky the news in several languages. But that victory is not without a certain irony. Yes, we now have a Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and an entire cable television channel (VH1) devoted to promoting the pantheon. But our musical cultural values have become so relative that the Beatles, Mr. Dylan, Gershwin, Ellington, and Sinatra now rank side by side in public esteem with the likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Yanni, Celine Dion, Neil Diamond and Garth Brooks. For in today's musical climate, whatever you declare to be art must be art, and forget persnickety snobs who think differently. Come to think of it, maybe it is time to trash the concept of the great artist.",STEPHEN HOLDEN,"FEB. 28, 1999","MUSIC; They're Recording, but Are They Artists?",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-they-re-recording-but-are-they-artists.html
"THE composer Jack Beeson concedes that in the context of American contemporary music, his opera ''Lizzie Borden,'' which had its premiere at the New York City Opera in 1965, is probably considered musically conservative. Based on accounts of a horrific ax murder that took place in Fall River, Mass., in 1892 and was soon steeped in legend (''Lizzie Borden took an ax, and gave her father 40 whacks,'' goes the familiar children's chant), the opera has generally been praised as gripping theater. But despite its angst and dissonance, the score is tonally grounded, often hews to recognizable keys, has stretches of sweet lyricism and set-piece arias, and even incorporates a likeness of a Protestant hymn tune and a pastiche of a Victorian parlor song.,''By the standards of what was mostly around in those days and what was mostly being written about,'' Mr. Beeson said recently in his Upper West Side apartment, '' 'Lizzie Borden' was, like all my operas, I suppose, conservative, whatever that term means.'',So it is surprising to find that in the mid-1960's, when a schism was widening between the self-described modernists, who mostly championed Serialism, and the so-called traditionalists, who retained links with tonality, a striking number of knowledgeable critics considered ''Lizzie Borden'' to be on the musical cutting edge.,Robert Commanday, in The San Francisco Chronicle, referred to the complex score's ''apparent 12-tone procedure.'' And Leighton Kerner, then a young freelancer, wrote in Women's Wear Daily that the score ''stands on its own as contemporary music'' and is ''not in the least bashful about jumping into atonality or Serialism.'',In fact, there is not a trace of Serialism in the music. How to explain the confusion? ''Back then, if it was dissonant, it was thought to be 12-tone,'' suggested Mr. Beeson, who, at 78, is affable, dapper and has recently completed his 10th operatic work. ''I don't think 'Lizzie' will strike many people today as being all that dissonant.'',Operagoers can judge for themselves on Saturday evening, when ''Lizzie Borden'' returns to the repertory of the company that presented its premiere but in a new production directed by Rhoda Levine and conducted by George Manahan. Produced with the Glimmerglass Opera, it was introduced there, to considerable acclaim, in the summer of 1997. The mezzo-soprano Phyllis Pancella will sing the title role; the baritone Stephen West is Lizzie's miserly father Andrew Borden; and the soprano Lauren Flanigan will portray his manipulative young second wife.,But there is more to the story of the confused critical reception ''Lizzie Borden'' received in 1965, and the continuing, and pointless, attempts to pigeonhole it stylistically. The decades of the 1960's and 70's were a fractious time in every aspect of American life, and music was no exception. After the Second World War, composers increasingly took refuge in university music departments, a development both good and bad. That composers were shielded from the necessity of earning a living through their music was obviously beneficial. But many composers claimed the intellectual high ground at the expense of mainstream audiences, writing works of daunting complexity according to rigorous procedures to engage and challenge one another. Those who still cared about reaching the outside public, which included virtually every composer of opera, were considered panderers by many of their atonalist colleagues.,The split was evident in Columbia University's music department, where Mr. Beeson had been teaching since 1945. Mr. Beeson was fascinated and somewhat amused by conflicting accounts of the schism depicted by two American composers, who were born in the same year, 1938, and who attended the college at the same time. As reported by K. Robert Schwarz in a 1997 article in these pages, Charles Wuorinen ridiculed the idea that composers at Columbia during that period were under the stranglehold of Serialist bullies on the faculty. ''The reigning orthodoxy was, on one hand, a kind of Coplandesque Americana and, on the other hand, the symphonism of Howard Hanson and Roy Harris,'' Mr. Wuorinen was quoted as saying.,But the other composer, John Corigliano, who now writes luxuriously tonal works, insisted that Serialism was the ''official academic manner'' at the time. Mr. Beeson, who knew them both as students and respects them as composers, said he did not recognize the Columbia that either described. But he was not entirely surprised.,''An undergraduate is young, excited, combative, and thinks that everyone who isn't with him is against him,'' he said. ''Written all over Charlie's and John's reactions were their own rather strong personalities between the ages of 18 and 22.'',Mr. Beeson's perspective on the schism is refreshingly undogmatic. Moreover, to him, the central issue is not where his operas fit in the spectrum of 20th-century compositional styles. Opera is a world unto itself, with its own byways and practices, he says.,''People who write more than a few operas get to be known as opera composers,'' he said. ''I think they are set aside somewhat by the regular composers of so-called serious music, who don't necessarily look down on the opera composers, but look sideways at them.'' The sideways glance Mr. Beeson refers to is not free of a certain prejudice, he believes: ''An opera composer is often thought of by the serious composer of chamber and orchestra works as someone who is diluting the purity of music with words, lights, costumes and the rest of it, writing musical dramas for the great unwashed.'',Mr. Beeson believes that the pragmatic skills required to compose a successful opera can come only from experience in the theater. On this subject he agrees entirely with Aaron Copland, who divided composers like himself who ''play at writing operas'' from those ''hopelessly attracted to this 'form fatale.' '' Though Mr. Beeson has composed more than 110 nonoperatic works, he clearly considers himself among the hopelessly attracted few. And it took hold early in his life.,Born in Muncie, Ind., he grew up listening to the radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera in the early 1930's and started writing librettos as an adolescent, including an adaptation of Byron's ''Manfred'' and, closer to home, ''Red Wing,'' a tale of ''an Indian princess who was supposed to be buried under our boy scout camp,'' he said.,Lacking the musical skill to set his own librettos, he attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, then took private lessons with Bartok in New York. In 1945, he began his association with Columbia, first working as a rehearsal pianist, coach and assistant conductor in the Opera Workshop, which for nearly two decades produced innovative operatic productions, including significant premieres of American operas.,He learned first-hand that the best opera composers were those with a wide palette of styles. The music he wrote, in 1957, for ''The Sweet Bye and Bye,'' a story of Christian evangelists confronting revelers in Atlantic City in the 1920's, evokes evangelical hymns and flapper dances. But ''Lizzie Borden,'' which Mr. Beeson called ''a highly wrought-up and agonized affair,'' is expressionistic and harmonically pungent, though here, too, the music abounds with period touches. When the music historian Nicolas Slonimsky described Mr. Beeson's style as ''marked by enlightened utilitarianism,'' the composer could not have been more pleased.,The New York City Opera has selected ''Lizzie Borden'' to be telecast nationwide on March 24 as part of the ''Live From Lincoln Center'' series. Kenward Elmslie, the librettist, and Richard Plant, who prepared the scenario, based the work on the historical Lizzie Borden, who was accused of hacking not only her father but also her young stepmother to death. Though charged and tried, she was acquitted for lack of evidence. But the operatic Lizzie is clearly the murderer, and the act is depicted in music of slashing, visceral intensity.,There are listeners for whom operas like ''Lizzie Borden'' are hopelessly melodramatic, virtually a mid-century American continuation of Italian verismo. But it is hard to deny the subtlety and power of the characterizations. Lizzie is sullen and full of repressed anger but also terribly lonely. Her younger, more vulnerable sister, Margaret, is a role for lyric soprano, but her high-flying lyrical lines and coloratura twitterings suggest that Margaret, also a virtual prisoner in her father's home, is unstable and in danger. Andrew Borden's grim bluster is conveyed through pouting, sputtering vocal lines. But he is also powerfully attracted to his young wife, the scheming Abigail. Yet when Abigail sings of living in a house heavy with the presence of her husband's first wife, the unnerving music makes you feel she has a legitimate complaint.,The original 1965 New York City Opera performance is now available on a two-disk CRI recording, an important contribution to the discography of American opera. A 1974 recording of ''The Sweet Bye and Bye,'' by the Kansas City Lyric Theater, has also been reissued on CD by Citadel. These releases, plus others to come, should help Mr. Beeson's operas secure more productions, especially now that the climate for contemporary music is more tolerant of stylistic diversity.,And he is still composing them. His ninth, a one-act work called ''Sorry, Wrong Number,'' based on the 1944 radio play, will be given its premiere at the Kaye Playhouse in New York in late May. Mr. Beeson turned to a frequent collaborator, Sheldon Harnick, for a libretto, but Mr. Harnick wasn't interested: ''Sheldon said the story was too 'Grand Guignol' for him, and he didn't approve of the murder at the end. He told me to do it myself. So I did. Turned out just fine.''",ANTHONY TOMMASINI,"FEB. 28, 1999",MUSIC; The Opera That Takes an Ax To Strict Definitions of Style,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-the-opera-that-takes-an-ax-to-strict-definitions-of-style.html
"THE idea behind the One Earth Tour, the Kodo drummers' annual four months of performances outside Japan, is that drumming is a primal human activity and people everywhere respond to it. Including New Jersey? The Japanese ensemble's coming appearances in Newark, New Brunswick and Princeton suggest they think so.,The group's rigorous dedication to taiko, their percussive art, is akin to religious devotion. Taiko drumming is a traditional form of communication in Japan, originally for summoning gods and announcing emergencies, but Kodo's bravura drumming does not enact any ancient rituals. Rather, the flashy performance displays athletic grace and strength, as well as entertaining choreography and eye-catching costumes. It is adapted to appeal to a variety of cultures and styles, which habitually pollinate Kodo as freely as Kodo enriches them.,Kodo was founded in 1971 as Demon Drums. Its members live communally with the staff and crew on Sado, an island in the Sea of Japan. They wake at dawn to train and run (drummers used to run the Boston Marathon), building muscle power to beat the numerous drums ranging from snare-size to 900 pounds.,The biggest drum, carved from a single tree trunk and called o-daiko, is Kodo's signature instrument. O-daiko is poised on a lantern-decked cart, while its two heads are dramatically pummeled with bats by muscular young men wearing colorful loincloths and sweatbands. One beats steadily, while the other improvises rhythms.,Medium-sized drums are played from a sitting position, with legs extended, and side drums are carried, ''Yankee Doodle'' fife-and-drum style. Drummers kneel and use hands for the little high-pitched ones. (Kodo's American interpreter, Daniel Rosen, finds these ''very satisfying to hit, for some reason,'' and drums every chance he gets.),It goes without saying that this is loud, visceral fun, but even with intermittent shouts, the noise doesn't blast the eardrums so much as make the ground tremble underfoot or, up close, make the teeth feel funny. As an apprentice once put it, ''It's user-friendly sound, and you are embraced by its fullness, rather than assaulted.'',Japan has many taiko groups, and in 1981 this one, which made taiko an art form and tours Japan four months a year, began calling itself Kodo, from the Japanese word for heartbeat. The word consists of two characters: ko, which means drum, and do, from the word for child. Children of the drum, therefore.,In contrast to the relatively one-dimensional experience of attending symphony concerts -- the ears do the work, but to see one concert is to see them all -- much of Kodo's appeal is visual, and choreographed with stylized festivity. Drummers freeze into poses until they start to play, while active performers squat, plie and brace to increase the impact of their batlike mallets.,Kodo's compositions, for drums plus stringed shamisen, bamboo xylophone and flute, gong and wooden clacker, emanate from rural customs and traditions: harvest and transport, fishing, festivals and tales. But although Kodo's philosophy and performers are rooted and trained in tradition, they are not bound by it, and many of their compositions are from current times.,The smaller novelty numbers convey plots or moods. In a humorous one, players sit cross-legged in a line, playing small decorative cymbals whose sounds and manner of being played depict an argument and a fight. In another number, which has a new look, one man plays many drums positioned as a drum set. The mallet-swinging is loose-limbed, like a tennis lob, or forceful, like a serve. To play the big drums, men strip off their jackets to play the little ones.,There are kinder, gentler pieces featuring flutes, but because of Kodo's athletic drumming, stylized gestures and ersatz-ethnic dancing, the troupe is often reviewed by dance critics.,Of the 15 performers on this tour, 4 are women, a recent addition. Women began in Kodo by playing flutes, dancing with small cymbals or twirling fans as if they were batons. Now they do some drumming as well. Kodo's present policy is to accept 12 or 13 apprentice players a year. This tour's performers are all Japanese, but anyone 25 or under, from anywhere, may apply.,Kodo's year is divided by the international tour, a national tour in Japan, and time on their island training and rehearsing for tours and recording sessions. The newest recording, for Sony, is ''Ibuki,'' and a recent PBS broadcast featured interviews on Sado conducted by Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead.,The highlight of Kodo's four months on Sado is the annual Earth celebration, a festival of three days to a week that has become Japan's leading world music event. ''People make pilgrimages,'' Mr. Rosen said. Last year, for Kodo's 10th anniversary, 8,000 guests camped on the beach and took their own instruments for onstage collaborations. Max Roach has attended, as have Donal Lunny from Ireland and the drummers of Barundi.,The Kodo performance at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center was nearly sold out last week. Listeners who cannot make one of the other New Jersey performances may want to cross the Hudson to the Beacon Theater in Manhattan on March 2, but the real plum sounds like the pilgrimage in August to Sado, where drums will doubtless be on hand.,KODO,New Jersey Performing Arts Center,1 Center Street, Newark,Saturday at 8 P.M.,(888) -466-5722,State Theater,15 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick,March 8 at 8 P.M.,(732) 246-7469,McCarter Theater,91 University Place, Princeton,March 9 at 8 P.M.,(609) 683-8000",LESLIE KANDELL,"FEB. 28, 1999","MUSIC; The Art of Percussion, In a Japanese Mode",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/music-the-art-of-percussion-in-a-japanese-mode.html
"MUSSORGSKY, who either didn't finish his operas or finished them twice, has always been a yammerer's delight. His works inspire interminable discussion as to who he really was, what he really meant, which (or whose) version is best and why. Any review of a performance of ''Boris Godunov'' has to start with a description of just what it contains and an evaluation of the performers' textual choices before the quality of the performance can even be broached.,A new recording by the Kirov Opera of St. Petersburg, conducted by the indefatigable Valery Gergiev (Philips 462 230-2; five CD's), seeks to still the yammering by presenting both of the composer's originals -- the practically all-male 1869 version, and the 1872 score replete with a Polish princess and four little animal ditties for other women's voices -- in what are billed as meticulously faithful reproductions. Sorry, yammer I must -- but wait.,With Tchaikovsky it is different. Russia's first full-time composing professional, he wrote quickly and with a minimum of fuss. ''I sit down at my desk at 9 A.M.,'' he once remarked, ''and the Muse has learned to be on time.'' He finished what he started, and started something else. Reviews of Tchaikovsky recordings, especially of the more familiar works, are usually concerned with performance quality alone, measured against the reviewer's personal favorites. Tchaikovsky has never needed to be rescued from himself or from his rescuers.,But now come Andrej Hoteev (rhymes with Mendeleyev), a pianist, and Vladimir Fedoseyev (rhymes with Hoteev), leading the Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra Moscow (formerly the All-Union Radio Orchestra) in a new Koch/Schwann release (3-6490-2; three CD's), to tell us that the man we've been calling Tchaikovsky all these years has been an impostor -- a creation of ''the 'Party' and the K.G.B.,'' no less (and no kidding) -- and that they have brought the real Tchaikovsky back from Lethe.,They have done this by traversing his four piano concertos (yes, four, if you include the two-movement ''Fantaisie de Concert'') and a couple of miscellaneous works for the same forces in what is billed as the premiere recording of their ''unabridged original versions.'' The packaging befits the grandiose claims: extensive notes accompanying each CD, a deluxe booklet full of photos (including a gallery of the ''Women in His Life'' -- don't you believe that nasty K.G.B.), and ambitious essays by the pianist and by a pair of Russian specialists. There is even an ancient cylinder recording of Tchaikovsky's voice: piping, jovial, not at all what you would expect (especially if you've read those notes and essays).,No use beating around the bush. This misbegotten project is surely the travesty of the decade. The performers' claim about original texts turns out to be a fraud. The ''new'' and ''original'' Tchaikovsky they or their spokespersons so blaringly tout is their own deranged invention, a pseudo-musicological Frankenstein. Not only have they loosed on us a Tchaikovsky Tchaikovsky would not have recognized, they have managed to create a Tchaikovsky Tchaikovsky would have abominated and despised.,Does that matter? In principle, of course, it needn't. There is no reason today's performers must please a dead man, even if he happens to be the composer. But in this case I doubt that anyone not cowed by the bogus musicology will like the results. Whether artlessly or cynically, the performers and their consultants are abusing musicology the way the worst Early Musickers once did, to justify inept and absurd performances. Yet beyond Early Music, and beyond musicology, this loony release reflects some of the most cherished assumptions of ''classical'' music-making and music-thinking in a funhouse mirror. That aspect makes it, in its inadvertently hilarious and improbable way, important.,I will not speculate about motives. Mr. Hoteev is new to me. But that Mr. Fedoseyev, a much-decorated Soviet hack, should be involved in this farrago is not surprising. He began his career as a player of the bayan -- a Russian-style accordion with buttons instead of a keyboard -- and achieved fame as the leader of an ''orchestra of folk instruments,'' one of those shimmering balalaika bands that dispensed Soviet kitsch to tourists under the old regime.,When he took over the All-Union Radio Orchestra in 1974 -- a reward for faithful party work, it was widely assumed -- the members staged a protest that led to a famous scandal. The string players, greeting the new maestro, put down their bows and met his signal to begin by presenting their violins and violas in balalaika position, right hands poised to strum.,Like many classical musicians coming from the other side of the tracks, Mr. Fedoseyev compensated with bombast. (And like many loyal Soviet artists in post-Soviet times, he now professes an abiding interest in whatever the Party and the K.G.B. proscribed: in the case of Tchaikovsky, his ''mystical, visionary, romantic'' side.) Mr. Fedoseyev's performances of Russian classics have always been the ''deepest'' and most ''serious'' around, for which read the slowest, the thickest-textured, the most bloated in dynamics. And so it is here with Tchaikovsky, except that the level of sluggishness and tumescence breaks all records.,Wherever it is possible to compare the tempos adopted by the present performers with published metronome markings -- that is, in the Third Concerto and the ''Fantaisie de Concert'' -- the discrepancies are wondrous to behold. The opening tempo of the ''Fantaisie'' is given as 76 beats per minute. Mr. Hoteev and Mr. Fedoseyev begin at 53 and actually slow down from there. Where in the midst of the first movement's central cadenza the score says ''a little faster,'' Mr. Hoteev slows down again.,The second movement begins Andante cantabile, at 66 beats per minute. Mr. Hoteev starts off at 44, reaching the prescribed initial speed only where the score specifies a faster one (84). Where the music accelerates to Molto vivace, Mr. Fedoseyev again unaccountably slows the tempo. Where Tchaikovsky writes Vivacissimo (Very lively) and sets the beat value at 96 per minute, Mr. Fedoseyev grudgingly rises to 76, which is slower than the tempo prescribed for a section marked Moderato assai, ''Very medium'' (whatever that means -- but whatever it means, it is not very lively).,The tempos in the Third Concerto, a posthumously published work, range even farther afield. The opening Allegro brillante (never to be forgotten by anyone who has seen Balanchine's ''Ballet Imperial''), marked at 138 beats per minute, loafs at 70 or less: precisely half-tempo. A piano solo, marked Poco meno (A little less) and set at 126, goes at 55: appreciably under half-tempo. A passage in the cadenza, marked Allegro vivace (literally ''Merry and gay'') and set at 152, rises to a leaden 100. But when the next marking arrives -- Allegro non tanto (Not quite so fast), at 116 -- Mr. Hoteev plunges to 60, half-tempo again.,These are extraordinary deviations. You won't find Horowitz committing anything of the sort, or even Glenn Gould, to name two notorious meddlers. But of course, Mr. Fedoseyev and Mr. Hoteev bill themselves as the opposite of meddlers. They claim a puritanical fidelity to the composer, and all the authority to which the claim entitles them. By what argument can they reconcile their preaching with their practice?,By the oldest dodge in the book. As noted, the Third Concerto was a posthumous work. Tchaikovsky left the first movement more or less complete but the two others in an unorchestrated ''particell,'' or sketch score. The three were published (by two different publishers) as two separate works, the Allegro brillante as Concerto No. 3 (Op. 75, 1894), the ''Andante and Finale'' as Opus 79 (1897). Both publications were edited by Sergei Taneyev, a brilliant pianist and revered composer and pedagogue, who au thored a celebrated textbook that reduced the study of counterpoint to a set of mathematical principles. He began his career as a protege of Tchaikovsky and remained a lifelong friend.,Here is what Eckhardt van den Hoogen's notes to the recording assert about Taneyev: ''This former 'teacher's pet' had no understanding at all of Tchaikovsky's music and felt that it was his mission to approximate it to his own mathematical-speculative ideas.'' In particular, Tchaikovsky's tempo markings ''had to rub the 'numbers man' Taneyev the wrong way.'' Consequently, ''the metronome markings that he assigned to a number of different scores were much faster than the composer had imagined.'' And since it was the nefarious Taneyev who played the premiere performance of the ''Fantaisie de Concert'' as well, he must have meddled with the published tempos there, too.,So we can blame the spectacular tempo discrepancies not on Mr. Hoteev and Mr. Fedoseyev, but on Taneyev, to whose list of crimes against Tchaikovsky venality is eventually added as a banal clincher. ''There were good commercial reasons for bringing the master's unpublished works out on the market,'' Mr. van den Hoogen raves in righteous wrath; ''after all, Taneyev's labors should bring in at least a few rubles.'',Is there any evidence to support these allegations? Don't be silly. Their purpose is to eliminate evidence that contradicts the performers' absurdly swollen performances, in support of which Mr. Hoteev offers no facts of his own but rather 12 oracular dicta under the rubric ''Tchaikovsky's Piano Concertos for the Third Millennium.'' They set a new benchmark in the annals of pseudo-musicological huff and puff.,Every button in sight gets pushed. ''The four piano concertos by Pyotr Tchaikovsky have the same significance for Russian music as do the five piano concertos by Ludwig van Beethoven for the world of Western music,'' reads one. They are ''really symphonies for piano and orchestra,'' another predictably asserts, which allows another flattering comparison: ''In this case Tchaikovsky resembles the Johannes Brahms of the Piano Concerto No. 2 and the Double Concerto.'' Tchaikovsky's music exhibits all ''the classical logic of musical form'' while at the same time ''revolutionizing the piano concerto genre.'',In sum, ''it is clearly evident that Tchaikovsky was far closer to the sources of Western culture at that time -- Wagner, Bruckner and Mahler, not to mention Schopenhauer and Spinoza -- than has generally been assumed over the past 100 years.'' What 19th-century figure Mr. Hoteev had in mind when name-dropping the 17th-century Spinoza is anybody's guess, but the remaining names are all dependably German, giving Tchaikovsky the pseudo-musicological equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal.,Now here is what Tchaikovsky, on a visit to Vienna, wrote back to his patron Madame von Meck in the fall of 1877: ''Altogether, it seems to me Germany is deterioriating as regards music. I believe the French are now coming to the fore.'' He wrote this in reaction to the First Symphony of Brahms, ''a composer whom the Germans exalt to the skies.'' Tchaikovsky's verdict: ''He has no charms for me. I find him cold and obscure, full of pretensions but without any real depths.'',Eleven years later, in a letter to another correspondent, Tchaikovsky returned to the subject with even greater vehemence: ''Isn't Brahms, in essence, just a caricature of Beethoven? Aren't his pretensions to profundity, strength and power detestable, when the content he pours into those Beethovenian forms is so pitiful and insignificant?'',Whether this is an accurate description of Brahms can be debated some other time. But I can attest to its accuracy as a description of Mr. Hoteev and Mr. Fedoseyev's turgid renditions, which in their pretensions to a spuriously Germanic profundity, strength and power make Tchaikovsky's aristocratically sumptuous and festive music seem pitiful and insignificant indeed. All that these performers succeed in proving is that Tchaikovsky makes an awful Bruckner, which is something Tchaikovsky could (and should) have told them.,But their dogmatic insistence that Tchaikovsky's ''originals'' were sacrosanct, and that all attempts at revision (whether by Taneyev or by Alexander Siloti, who with Tchaikovsky's blessing published a widely used abridgment of the Second Concerto) were ill-intentioned, has an authentically Brucknerian ring. It is the claim that Bruckner scholars, beginning with Robert Haas, have long been making against the shortened Schalk and Loewe editions, which helped the master's symphonies overcome early resistance, just as Rimsky-Korsakov's colorfully orchestrated abridgement of his friend Mussorgsky's ''Boris Godunov'' helped the opera achieve its present status in worldwide repertory.,Recent investigations by Benjamin Korstvedt, Bryan Gilliam and Morten Solvik have shown the Bruckner question to have been tinged with anti-Semitism. Well, what German question isn't? The ugly specter makes people eager to turn away from the problem and, as one critic put it recently, consign it to ''some leafy campus.'' The subtexts that inform our knee-jerk pieties are no mere academic matter, though. We need to bring them to consciousness if we ever want to shake free. The cases of Mussorgsky and, now, Tchaikovsky show that the dogmatic anti-editorial stance has other roots as well.,Taneyev and Siloti, Tchaikovsky's mediators (or ''adulterators,'' to use their present accusers' ugly word) were not Jewish. Even though Siloti, of Italian descent, was in the eyes of rabid Russian nationalists also ethnically suspect, the peremptory rejection of their interventions is tinged, rather, with another sort of blanket intolerance. Its source lies in the ancient and inveterately asocial modernist principle Jean-Paul Sartre enshrined in the motto of his once-famous play ''No Exit'': hell is other people.,Not only editors, in this late-late-Romantic view, but also performers, critics and (especially) audiences are a composer's natural enemies. All, that is, are potential threats to the sanctity of the creator's individual genius and his autonomy of action and decision. It is by now the most tedious cliche of 20th-century criticism that ''an eagerness to please'' (to quote another recent reviewer) is the worst composerly vice. After thus lumping and damning the work of six young composers, the reviewer found a seventh item ''refreshing in its disagreeableness,'' for that connoted authenticity.,It is easy to see how an attitude of extremist individualism, bone-tired in ''the West,'' might still appeal to Russians recently released from Soviet tyranny. But again, compare Tchaikovsky, who wrote of Wagner (with whom Mr. Hoteev and Mr. Fedoseyev now want to associate him) in solidarity with the audience. ''Before, music strove to delight people,'' he complained. ''Now they are tormented and exhausted.'',The only sort of performance misanthropic modernism might sanction would be a reconstruction of the earliest authorial text, preferably one that existed before the work was ever performed -- before it was exposed, that is, to the corrosive atmosphere of social mediation (or, more simply, to Other People). As it happens, an ideal test case lurks among the Tchaikovsky piano concertos: the famous First. Its initial exposure to an Other was a famous fiasco, when Tchaikovsky played it at a private Christmas Eve gathering in 1874 for Nikolai Rubinstein, its intended soloist, and received a cruel rebuke.,This Rubinstein, who as director of the Moscow Conservatory was then Tchaikovsky's employer, was the brother of the more famous Anton (Tchaikovsky's main teacher) and a virtuoso of commanding authority in his own right. As Tchaikovsky reported to Madame von Meck, the pianist pronounced the concerto ''worthless, absolutely unplayable; the passagework so broken, so incoherent, so unskillfully written that it could not even be improved.'',''The work itself was bad, trivial, common,'' Tchaikovsky (and Rubinstein) went on. ''Here and there I had stolen from other people; only one or two pages were worth anything; all the rest had better be destroyed, or entirely rewritten.'',Acting for once (and practically the only time in his life) like a good modernist, Tchaikovsky published the concerto, in defiance of Rubinstein, ''without altering a single note,'' as he thundered to Madame von Meck. That was the version originally performed by Hans von Bulow in Boston in 1875 but not printed in full score until 1955.,I assumed, from the proud proclamation that the present CD's contain nothing but ''unabridged original versions,'' that I would finally get to hear it. And while resurrecting superseded first drafts (like the notorious Sibelius Fifth Symphony issued a couple of years ago by Bis) is often just a bid for attention, and touting them as revelations is nearly always folly, hearing them (once) is always interesting. The prospect of hearing the ''Boston'' version of the First Concerto, the very one reviled by Nikolai Rubinstein, is what sparked my interest in the present set.,Imagine my disappointment, then, when the piano entered with the familiar chords banged out by hands crashing from a great height in three distinct keyboard registers, rather than rolled sonorously by hands in constant contact with the keys and in the low-to-middle register alone. The crash-bang effect was Siloti's idea, actively solicited by Tchaikovsky and first published in an edition of 1889, the last to appear during the composer's lifetime. Ten years earlier, in a previous revised edition, Tchaikovsky, now over his pique with Rubinstein, had gratefully incorporated the suggestions of Edward Dannreuther, the pianist who had given the English premiere, and who sent Tchaikovsky proposed revisions for 145 measures in the first movement. They simplified and regularized -- yes, and made more conventional -- the passagework, which in Tchaikovsky's ''unpianistic'' original had tended to slow the performer down.,Mr. Hoteev and Mr. Fedoseyev's Brucknerian Tchaikovsky would surely have rejected Dannreuther's help, or even made additional complications to heighten viscosity. Yet while they continue to insist on tempos on the far side of molasses that might easily have accommodated the original figuration, Mr. Hoteev and Mr. Fedoseyev remain unaccountably faithful to the familiar Siloti-cum-Dannreuther text. They excuse the apparent contradiction with a typical pseudo-musicological rationalization: Tchaikovsky is known to have conducted from the 1889 score.,That gives evidence of his preference, all right. For those who need the composer's permission to leave the room, that makes the version recorded here ''authentic.'' But it is no more ''original'' than your Cliburn or your Horowitz. All it shows is that Tchaikovsky did not fetishize his unabridged originals the way modern pseudo-musicologists do, and that his blustery restorers, like most performers who have made similar claims, practice what they preach only to the extent that it suits them.,So is there nothing at all worth hearing here? There is one thing. In addition to the four concertos and a little Allegro in C minor composed while Tchaikovsky was studying with Anton Rubinstein at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, the set contains a concert fantasy in F minor called ''Ungarische Zigeunerweisen'' (''Hungarian Gypsy Tunes''), by Sophie Menter, a rich pupil of Franz Liszt, who got her teacher to write (or sketch) the piece for her shortly before his death in 1886, and Tchaikovsky to orchestrate it in 1892. It is a hoot. And it is given a relatively de-Brucknered performance (Bruckner being as unlikely a gypsy as Tchaikovsky is a Bruckner) in which Mr. Hoteev shows that he can play the piano after all. The opening cadenza, which sounds the way a cimbalom would sound if played by the Phantom of the Opera, is almost worth the price of admission. If you buy it, though, please remember that I said ''almost.'',OH, and ''Boris''? It turns out that Mr. Gergiev is no more serious about keeping textual matters straight than Mr. Hoteev and Mr. Fedoseyev. The recording gives the 1869 and 1872 versions of the opera as they appear to one casually perusing the 1975 Oxford University Press score, edited by David Lloyd-Jones. To learn what was really in the two versions (which overlap considerably) you need to read the footnotes and critical report, and Mr. Gergiev evidently hasn't bothered. Thus, the ''1869'' cell scene has the offstage choruses added in 1872, and the ''1872'' opening and death scenes still sport passages Mussorgsky cut from them when revising.,Does it matter? Not if you are merely offering yours as another subjectively motivated performance. As such, Mr. Gergiev's readings have much to recommend them. They are exceedingly brisk, effective, efficient. The orchestra digs into Mussorgsky's oft-scorned scoring with a gusto and an eclat that make you wonder why Rimsky-Korsakov was ever called in to doctor it. But the conductor is clearly the star of the show, and that makes for a considerable flattening-out of the drama. The only place where real characters emerge is the 1872 Polish act, thanks particularly to the forceful Marina of Olga Borodina, who sings like a real prima donna. All the others, including both Borises (Nikolai Putilin and Vladimir Vaneyev), sing like troupers on good modernist behavior.,So we have here the only ''Boris'' on records, maybe the only one ever, to be dominated by the Polish act. And that kind of a ''Boris'' is not Mussorgsky's kind. Claims of textual fidelity turn out, as usual, not to be much of a guarantee of authenticity. But textual fidelity will matter greatly to those who buy this set out of legitimate curiosity, thinking that now they will really hear the two versions plain. They won't. Which is in every way a shame.",RICHARD TARUSKIN,"FEB. 28, 1999",MUSIC; Russian Originals De-  and Re-edited,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-russian-originals-de-and-re-edited.html

"WHEN I was in my early teens, my father and I spent countless Sunday afternoons driving around the Hudson Valley in his Volkswagen Beetle. We often sang -- rather, he sang and I sometimes joined in. I didn't know many of the hundreds of Tin Pan Alley and Broadway show tunes in his repertory; besides, their shapely melodies, full of sharps, flats and key changes, were daunting.,If I ventured to add my voice, my father quickly left the melody in my quavery custodianship to improvise a flawless harmony. Hitting an especially piquant interval, he would turn to me and say something like, ''Flatted sixth,'' his feigned complacence masking the pleasure he took in the sharpness of his ear. I wouldn't have known a flatted sixth if it had come crashing through the VW's roof and knocked me on the head.,My father was unusually musical, but that's not the point. He grew up in an America whose pop tunes, the music he and his friends imbibed as youths, were often highly sophisticated pieces of work. (My mother is from a musical culture, too, but that's another story; she's Viennese.) My father's generation, raised on Berlin, Gershwin, Porter and Kern, developed a harmonic acuity, a suppleness of ear, that mine lacks.,I grew up on the three chords of rock-and-roll, on Phil Spector, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones (and the Beatles, of course, but they were an anomaly, their chord progressions unpredictable, their melodies hard to harmonize to). Music meant as much to my friends and me as it had to my father and his contemporaries -- more, I think, for it was the emblem of our resistance to the conventions we considered our parents trapped in. Lyrically, our music was more interesting than all but a few show tunes. That was Dylan's significance, after all: to give pop lyrics the resonance of literature. But Dylan's harmonies are crude compared with Gershwin's and Porter's. We and our musical heroes were, and are, stuck in the blues, in simple triads and major keys that would have bored Gershwin to tears.,I'm not saying that everyone who grew up in the 30's can sing perfect harmony and identify tricky intervals; I'm saying that music fans today have a less intuitive grasp of two of music's essential building blocks, harmony and melody, than they had 50 years ago.,I can't marshal much hard evidence for my argument. But given the millions of hours of piano lessons my father's generation collectively squirmed through, once as standard a feature of middle-class family life as the upright in the parlor; given the harmonically rich tunes that once floated daily from Times Square office buildings out across the nation; given that America's favorite dance hits once had enough intellectual meat to pique the improvisational genius of a Charlie Parker or a Lester Young -- given these facts, these vanished aspects of everyday American life, it's hard not to suspect that the average pop-music listener, circa 1940, was more alive to the full range of musical expression than his or her baby-boom offspring.,Forty-five and graying, almost as old as my father was when we took those drives, I eye my future uneasily. Am I going to spend the rest of my life listening to rock-and-rollers chase threadbare melodies across three chords? And what about the generation after mine, the Tone-Def Generation, reared on music in which melody and harmony are even more attenuated? It would be easy to argue that the last five decades represent a wholesale dumbing-down of America's musical public.,Culture's path is never that simple. My father's hummed bass lines may have been harmonically ingenious, but their four-to-the-bar uniformity always irked me. In rock and its spawn, rhythm has supplanted harmony and melody as the creative motor. You don't need to be a hip-hop fan (although you do need a good sense of rhythm) to hear the skill and creativity of more than a few rappers, deejays and remix artists. Is it possible that the young people who flock to today's dance clubs are developing an awareness of rhythmic nuance equal to an earlier generation's harmonic sophistication?,Rhythm's new prominence reflects a seismic cultural shift. As the world shrinks, Euro-America is awash in influences once beneath its notice. The rhythm-rich sounds of Africa and the African diaspora, whether Nigerian juju, Brazilian samba or African-American funk, now pervade pop music. Today's musicians draw on, and today's listeners absorb, rhythmic riches that were unimaginable 40, or even 20, years ago.,Still, how excited can you get about pop's expanding rhythmic possibilities if our awareness of harmony and melody is atrophying? Nor am I at all comfortable with some of the social implications of rhythm's hegemony. When The New York Times critic Jon Pareles recently wrote that in an era of overload, rhythm organizes time and information in manageable, pleasurable ways, he touched on a troubling state of affairs: the enervating sensory glut that makes serenity all but impossible today. And Mr. Pareles's judgment that contemporary pop's reduced melodies are the victims of shrinking attention spans -- well, it's a chilling thought.,My father and I weren't just tooling around the suburbs, of course; we were traversing the century, navigating its currents. He died 20 months ago. As the months lengthen into years, I miss him more and more. A small part of that ache, I think, is that his death severed my living connection to an already faraway place: an America whose pace was leisurely enough for its pop music to be elegant. My father's ear thrived on the music of those centenarians Gershwin and Ellington, whom my generation may admire but does not love. Our souls belong to Elvis, and we pay the price.",TONY SCHERMAN,"FEB. 28, 1999","MUSIC; Oh, Remember the Days When Music Could Sing?",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-oh-remember-the-days-when-music-could-sing.html
"BOSTON'S great musical event of 1869 was a ''Peace Jubilee'' organized by Patrick Gilmore, who, before John Philip Sousa, was America's most famous bandmaster. A gargantuan wooden structure -- big enough to hold 50,000 people, including a chorus of 10,000 and an orchestra of 500 -- was erected on the Back Bay. The opening program included overtures by Wagner and Rossini, patriotic airs, choral numbers by Martin Luther, Mozart and Rossini, and -- the piece de resistance -- the ''Anvil Chorus'' from Verdi's ''Trovatore'' with 100 anvils, 100 firemen and synchronized cannons. Credible observers reported that this ''monster concert'' was dignified, well prepared and tumultuously received.,But Gilmore's Peace Jubilee worried John Sullivan Dwight. More than anyone else, Dwight influentially pursued an agenda of rarefied ''classical music'' and fostered an esthetic that insured the extinction of hybrid musical entertainments intermingling ''incongruous, internecine elements.'' By ''classical music,'' Dwight meant music different from, and better than, ''popular music'': a distinction now hoary and untenable as we approach the new century. If it is not time to retire the term ''classical music,'' it is past time to reconsider its meaning.,Though American writers distinguished between classical and popular music as early as the 1830's, Dwight was decisive in crystallizing and promoting this weighted terminology, beginning with the founding of Dwight's Journal of Music, the most important such 19th-century American periodical, in 1852. The first issue, in fact, announced Dwight's intention to ''insist much on the claims of 'classical' music, and put out its beauties and its meanings.'' This elevated subject matter expressly transcended ''styles more simple, popular or modern.'',The music thus privileged, comprising a Germanic canon beginning with Bach and Handel and stopping with Mendelssohn and Schumann, was judged superior by Dwight not merely esthetically but also morally. Beethoven, in particular, was literally ''sacred.'' His symphonies ennobled the listener. Concomitantly, listeners to popular music were thereby debased. Dwight termed Stephen Foster's ''Old Folks at Home,'' the best-known American music of its time, a ''melodic itch.'',Though Europeans were sacralizing classical music at the same moment, Americans like Dwight were peculiarly intent on achieving the purest of pedigrees. This zeal reflected insecurities that came with a borrowed high culture. It also reflected a native Puritanism that stressed and guarded the moral content of art. Buttressing Dwight was the conductor Theodore Thomas, whose itinerant Thomas Orchestra implanted an American symphonic tradition. Thomas called his concerts ''sermons in tones.'' He regarded popular music as ''having more or less the devil in it.'' Like Dwight, he mistrusted opera; it connoted theater: popularity and sin.,A third crucial early influence on American notions of classical music was Henry Lee Higginson, who created the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1881. Higginson insisted that his musicians not play for dancing on days they rehearsed or performed for him. He hired sober conductors like Wilhelm Gericke and Karl Muck. He implemented ''popular concerts'' -- later, the Boston Pops -- by way of segregating lighter symphonic fare. Unlike the Vienna Philharmonic and other European orchestras of comparable attainment, Higginson's orchestra never played in an opera pit. In fact, Boston, schooled by Dwight, resisted opera, and also Brahms and Wagner.,New York fostered a more liberal ''classical music.'' In the 1880's and 90's, the New York conductor Anton Seidl, high priest of America's Wagner movement, extended the canon to Berlioz, Wagner and Liszt. Such was the potency of Seidl's efforts that they not only effaced popular music but also captured popular venues.,At Manhattan Beach, Gilmore and then Sousa led the band. At neighboring Brighton Beach, Seidl led the orchestra in such weighty repertory as Wagner's ''Flying Dutchman'' Overture, ''Les Preludes'' by Liszt and excerpts from Berlioz's ''Damnation of Faust.'' Implausibly, the 3,000-seat seaside Music Pavilion, filled to capacity, became a classical-music shrine holier than Carnegie Hall. In one Brighton Beach address, Seidl advocated ''good music'' over popular airs. He named, as exemplars, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Liszt and Wagner: a remarkably progressive list. Never before or after was the classical canon this dynamic.,A decade later, in 1909, Gustav Mahler took Seidl's onetime place at the helm of the New York Philharmonic. Mahler's symphonies were criticized in New York for mixing classical and folk influences. The same purist critics -- most prominently, Henry Krehbiel of The New York Tribune -- considered incipient ''jazz'' vulgar and barbaric.,In Europe, Debussy and Ravel had already discovered Indonesian gamelan music. Bartok and Kodaly had begun notating Hungarian peasant songs. American composers, following Dvorak's American agenda, had begun investigating ''Negro melodies'' and American Indian chants as source tunes for symphonies and operas. Classical music was softening -- and hardening. The canon, once a nascent and necessary cause, grew old and static. Sacralization, once applied to composers newly discovered and promoted, was conferred on conductors -- in particular, Arturo Toscanini -- of music long familiar.,Whatever one makes of the popular music condemned by Dwight and Thomas (''Old Folks at Home'' was admired by Dvorak), by the 30's jazz had become a notably sophisticated and -- at least in European eyes -- prestigious popular genre. But Paul Rosenfeld, the central critical advocate of Aaron Copland and other American composers ''come of age,'' called jazz ''a product of second-rate feelings.'' He greeted Copland's Piano Concerto of 1927 as a triumph over George Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue.'' Rosenfeld dismissed Gershwin as insufficiently highbrow, a verdict implicitly endorsed by music-appreciation writers who simply ignored him.,Even Dwight, in the context of his time, embodied intellectual vitality. He promoted pure high culture at a moment when it needed to be set apart from polkas and operatic potpourris if a canon was to form.,A century later, intellectuals and classical music had parted company. Today, many of the leading instrumentalists and composers who turn up on our symphonic programs -- Gidon Kremer, John Adams, Steve Reich -- cannot be termed ''classical'' musicians. Even the rules governing eligibility for the Pulitzer Prize in music have been changed, resulting in the selection of Wynton Marsalis's jazz oratorio, ''Blood in the Fields,'' as the 1997 winner. As the musicologist Robert Fink remarks in the current issue of the journal American Music, the classical canon has lost its role as a ''cultural validator'' defining ''art music.'',''The canon of Western classical music is now just one among many and not the most culturally prestigious anymore, at least in America,'' Mr. Fink writes. ''Classical music will never be paradigmatic or hegemonic again.'',WHAT does ''classical music'' mean today? If the term is to retain anything like its old aplomb, it must refer to a moment now past: to a genre and its attendant prestige and influence. In fact, we can already look back on classical music as a cultural phenomenon peaking in the 19th century and declining after World War I.,It is no wonder that a 1997 Salzburg Seminar on the future of classical music spent hours asking what ''classical music'' means these days, or that the last annual convention of the National Association of Schools of Music devoted a session to the same question. If musicians, music scholars and music educators have grown uncomfortable identifying with classical music, what can they identify with instead? I call it ''post-classical music.'',What comes next for the onetime canon in these post-classical times? We will find out. Certainly, we will not abandon Bach and Beethoven. Bruckner's symphonies will continue to afford cathedral experiences in the concert hall. But the new direction of things, notwithstanding conventional symphonic wisdom, is away from the Higginson-style separation of ''sermons in tones'' from ''pops.'' Something like Gilmore's hybridized musical extravaganzas may be in the offing: not cosmetic crossover concerts, but a considered or rambunctious interplay of genres -- post-classical, pop, folk, vernacular -- as yet rarely attempted.,Four months ago, this section of The New York Times quietly abandoned the distinction between its ''classical music'' and ''popular music'' pages. This sign of The Times is also a sign of the times.",JOSEPH HOROWITZ,"FEB. 28, 1999",MUSIC; Learning to Live in a Post-Classical World,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-learning-to-live-in-a-post-classical-world.html
"THE good news from most of the world's major classical-music labels is that the gloom of recent years has largely been dispelled. Granted, classics account for only 2.3 percent of the American record market, just less than jazz (2.5 percent), according to Soundscan, a company that tracks sales. But the executives who run most of the major labels say their divisions are profitable and the future is secure.,The bad news is that this profitability has been attained through a series of bloodlettings in recent years. Staffs have been cut, artists have been jettisoned and project lists have been pared. All these things have happened before, of course: the marketplace has long dictated expansions and contractions that occur with almost tidal regularity. But in the last five years, the rules of engagement have taken a radical turn. Now, the standard repertory -- the Romantic symphonies, chamber works and operas that were formerly a safe haven -- has become a target.,This is the latest development in a corporatization of artist and repertory decisions that began in the late 1970's, when pop-dominated labels rebelled against the expectation that their profits would subsidize the classics. A series of takeovers in the 1980's and 90's looked promising: when Bertelsmann took over RCA and Sony acquired CBS, their recording programs increased exponentially. Warner joined the fray, buying Erato, Teldec and Finnadar. And Seagram's, having just bought Polygram, has assured Deutsche Grammophon, Philips and Decca/London that they will be unscathed.,But the multinationals have shown a tendency to micromanage, and companies that were profitable and healthy quickly stopped taking a benign view of divisions that produced less startling yields. Even freak hits like the Three Tenors disks, which helped subsidize more serious, slower-selling recordings, became mixed blessings: they persuaded corporate number-crunchers that classics could sell in the millions if only artists and label executives would choose the right projects.,Right now, definitions and expectations are shifting wildly in the classics world, and as executives try to determine their companies' missions -- and as performers juggle conscience, artistry and ambition in a struggle to find their places -- the business has become peculiarly amorphous.,Conductors in particular are waking up to a hostile new world, as several whose recording careers seemed solid have been cut adrift. Charles Dutoit and Christoph von Dohnanyi, who recorded plentifully for Decca/London, have lost their exclusive contracts, and now work project by project. Leonard Slatkin, long RCA's great American hope, was dropped at the end of last year, when the company decided to throw its full weight behind the more recently signed Michael Tilson Thomas on the ground that Mr. Thomas's dynamic personality and his unusual repertory ideas were more easily marketed.,Mr. Slatkin brought the company his share of novelties, from Leroy Anderson vignettes to works by Ginastera and John Corigliano. But he also recorded the Tchaikovsky symphonies, and had hopes of making his way through the rest of the standard canon; that, in today's climate, is an unhealthy desire.,The likelihood that a conductor will get the go-ahead to record, say, a Beethoven cycle for a major label in 1999 is virtually nil. Label heads are unanimous on this point. And it seems not to bother consumers much, either. The principal reason record companies are reluctant to keep recording the warhorses, after all, is that people are not willing to buy the newest interpretations -- certainly not enough to justify the enormous recording costs, which are around $200,000 for an American orchestra (without soloists or chorus) and roughly a third as much in Europe.,WHY have these recordings lost their appeal? An undiplomatic answer is that in the core repertory, few of today's conductors are able to create the kind of excitement that made their predecessors' recordings hot commodities.,And the fact is, times have changed. In the 1950's, when LP's were new and the business was coming of age, Beethoven and Brahms cycles, let alone Mahler and Bruckner recordings, were sparse enough that each new release was an event. People bought those disks, memorized their interpretive quirks, engaged in impassioned debates and waited for other performers to weigh in. But after 50 years -- more if you factor in reissues from the 78-rpm era -- the catalogues are awash in recordings of the standard works.,In trying to determine who might buy a new Beethoven cycle, the record industry looks at a model of the market divided into three segments. ''Core collectors,'' who have traditionally sustained the business, can be expected to buy at least 40 new disks a year. Recordings that appeal to them generally sell fewer than 10,000 copies. ''New listeners,'' who have come to classics recently, might buy six or seven, but are more strongly drawn to new works -- say, Kronos Quartet recordings -- than to the standard repertory. Still, they can push sales toward 70,000 copies.,Beyond them lies the Promised Land, or more prosaically, the mass market: buyers uncommitted to classical music but who, with the right media push (a PBS special or a film connection) can be induced to snap up recordings by the millions. The champion here is James Horner's ''Titanic'' film score, on Sony Classical, which has reportedly sold 9.3 million copies.,The problem for a label with a new Beethoven cycle is that none of these groups have much use for it. Core collectors own cycles on CD by Toscanini, Walter, Bernstein, Szell, Karajan, Furtwangler and Mengelberg, and perhaps period-instrument traversals by Frans Bruggen and Roger Norrington, along with individual symphony recordings. New collectors gravitate toward classic accounts as well, partly because of the aura of reverence that surrounds them and partly because, as reissues, they are comparatively inexpensive. Forget the mass market.,The preference for reissued older recordings serves labels' interests, too. These sets were recorded when costs and royalty rates were low, and have long since been amortized. And with classic status translating to steady demand, they require only the slightest promotion.,Reissues, in fact, are now mentioned in the same breath as crossovers when executives speak of the lifeblood of the business. At RCA, which now releases only 30 new recordings a year (down from 120 three years ago), reissues make up 75 percent of the annual release schedule. Having enjoyed recent successes with boxed sets devoted to Sviatoslav Richter and William Kapell, the label is planning a 99-CD Rubinstein box (to be priced at about $1,500) for September, and a big Heifetz box and a more expansive Richter set for next year.,The ratio of new releases to reissues is less extreme elsewhere. Still, most labels know the value of their archives: Sony Classical's beautifully packaged Masterworks Heritage series has set a high standard for the presentation of historical recordings; EMI has sold Maria Callas every which way and is reviving its Great Recordings of the Century line; Deutsche Grammophon's Originals series was a nostalgic hit as well.,But the masters of ''secondary exploitation,'' as it is called in the business, are on staff at Philips. Having cobbled together a complete Mozart edition in 1991, using recordings from all the Polygram labels, Philips is now issuing a 200-disk series, Great Pianists of the 20th Century, which surveys the work of 73 pianists, with recordings licensed from all the major labels and plenty of material not previously available on CD.,The hunger for old recordings is so pronounced that orchestras have started mining their radio archives to produce and market sets of their own, with impressive results. On the heels of a pair of high-profile mail-order sets from the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic issued its ''Historic Broadcasts,'' a 10-disk survey of varied repertory, in 1997, and a 12-CD Mahler cycle this year. Remarkably, ''Historic Broadcasts,'' priced at $185, sold 5,000 copies in its first year; at $225, the Mahler box sold 2,500 copies in six months.,Where does all of this leave living, developing artists? Instrumentalists seem to be finding support, and period-instrument bands are flourishing. As for conductors, the ones willing to shelve their Beethovenian dreams in favor of unusual projects are having an easier time. Who would have thought, a decade ago, that EMI executives would speak with unbridled enthusiasm about a young English composer who writes in an alternately accessible and thorny style? Yet the company lists Thomas Ades's opera, ''Powder Her Face,'' among its best sellers.,Deutsche Grammophon, which had an enviable new-music series in the early 1970's but has since maintained a fairly staid image, has just introduced 20/21, a series named for the changing century, with disks devoted to Pierre Boulez, Toru Takemitsu, Mauricio Kagel, Elliott Carter and Arvo Part.,Singers have it made, sort of. The Alagnas, Matthias Goerne, Ian Bostridge, Cecilia Bartoli, Jennifer Larmore, Ben Heppner, Thomas Quast hoff, Renee Fleming, Bryn Terfel and Anne Sofie von Otter, new to the record bins in the last decade, are now bankable stars, churning out recital disks. Yet operas, like symphonies, are expensive and therefore less plentiful. There, too, unusual works -- and works with links to other media -- have an edge: Deutsche Grammophon released Andre Previn's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' within months of its premiere, thanks to the PBS broadcast, which yielded the live recording.,The major labels have long been overdue to explore new repertory, and if they lag behind independents in that regard, their marketing and distribution power will help them take over the areas the independents have pioneered. But the independents are unequivocally devoted to classical music, something that cannot be said of most multinational majors now. Conductors and soloists know they can get a green light for projects involving popular young composers like Mr. Ades, Aaron Jay Kernis, Richard Danielpour, Tan Dun or John Tavener. But they also see a contrary trend, which is that if they really want to see executives' eyes light up, they should propose recordings built around film scores, nonfilm works by film composers, or hybrids that draw on folk, pop, tango and world music, perhaps bringing together stars from each world.,Such projects ''treat the recording as an art form rather than just a preservation medium,'' in record company parlance. Fair enough: Glenn Gould approached his recordings that way, as does the Kronos Quartet. ''We're extending the definition of classical music'' is another commonplace. Who, at this late date, is against that? Yet the projects themselves often have the aura of something dreamed up in a boardroom, with sales projections discussed intently, and questions of their appropriateness for a classical music label not at all.,It may be unfashionable to say so, but definitions and boundaries are useful in music. To argue that distinct styles should inhabit their own realms is not to imply the superiority of one over another, to preclude honest cross-fertilization or to suggest that listeners should not experiment. But record labels have implied charters, and if they regularly abrogate them, neither the music nor its listeners are well served.,Crossovers, like them or not, have become part of the charter. But Sony Classical has started down a path that goes well beyond crossover, and if other labels follow suit, classical labels as we know them will be fundamentally altered. Michael Bolton giving bad performances of opera arias is crossover; but Marcus Roberts playing Joplin rags with wide-ranging improvisatory freedom is jazz. Offering it on a classical label misleads listeners who don't know Joplin and bypasses jazz fans who would appreciate its subtleties.,Similarly, ''Appalachia Waltz'' is a folk music album, Yo-Yo Ma's presence notwithstanding, just as Joe Jackson's ''Heaven and Hell'' is progressive rock, and Eileen Ivers's ''Crossing the Bridge'' is Celtic folk-rock. Nothing about these disks strikes the ear as classical, yet because they are on a classical label, that is how Soundscan registers their sales. The 2.3 percent of the market accorded to classics, then, may be inflated by ringers.,SONY may be responding to corporate pressure to make every project profitable, pressures that executives at other labels say they feel as well. If they all respond as Sony has, the effect may be devastating in years to come. Classical labels, after all, have always depended on the depth of their catalogues, and the current passion for reissues suggests that they always will. The only way to insure the strength of the back catalogue is to approach new projects not just with a sense of their immediate sales potential but also with an eye to their future usefulness, either as perennials or as material that can be recompiled to suit different needs.,It is hard to imagine that collectors a few decades from now will hanker after ''Appalachia Waltz'' the way buyers today seek out, say, Rubinstein's Chopin. The question is: will future collectors look back at the turn of the 21st century as a time of adventurous repertory expansion or a time when record labels abandoned art music to chase the quick buck?",ALLAN KOZINN,"FEB. 28, 1999",MUSIC; Classical Labels Are Profiting but Paying a Price,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-classical-labels-are-profiting-but-paying-a-price.html
"HERE'S one you may have heard before: Jazz is America's classical music. It's a declaration that is always intoned with great seriousness and a touch of argumentative pride; the intent is to grant jazz the respect it undeniably deserves. But that formulation has always left me skeptical, and I've come to think that it does current jazz more harm than good.,In bygone decades, conflating jazz and classical music had some remedial effect; it helped non-musicians understand that jazz is a serious discipline, and helped jazz make headway in institutions, with its media image and among arts donors. Now, the equation of jazz and classical music only interferes with drawing new listeners and helping them understand what they hear.,It's easy to see why people linked jazz and classical music. Both are music for music's sake, in a separate commercial realm from the windfalls of pop, rock and hip-hop. Both styles are primarily instrumental and wordless, without the easy signposts of pop verses and choruses. They both reward knowledgeable listeners, though they can easily be enjoyed without a music degree. And both call for their performers and listeners to be mature, emotionally if not chronologically: to have long attention spans, to understand depth and nuance.,Simply to enter either field as a performer is to make a huge commitment, because only virtuosos need apply. Musicians must be willing to practice until their hands ache, to absorb a long and rigorous tradition, and only then, after years of work, to find out whether they have the mysterious inspiration that will make them worthy soloists.,Classical music and jazz also share a recording esthetic: both are centered on real-time group performances, not recording-studio assemblages (though editing and retakes are common). Compared to pop albums, jazz and classical music are relatively inexpensive to record: days of studio time compared to months or years. At recording companies, classical music and jazz are often in the same corporate division, as the two specialized styles that connote prestige.,Yet the similarities end when it comes to the music itself. In almost every way except the high standards they impose on musicians, jazz and classical music are diametrically opposed. Every esthetic criterion is different: the smoothness of instrumental and vocal delivery in most classical music versus the smears and growls of jazz, well-tempered classical intonation versus the blues inflections of jazz, the central role of rhythm in jazz versus the peripheral one of rhythm in classical music, and, most important, the fixed classical composition versus the improvisatory disciplines of jazz. Classical performances are almost entirely premeditated, resuscitating scores from the distant or near past; jazz insists on surprises and lives in an eternal present tense.,In classical music since the Baroque era, the composer has been exalted above all. Performers are expected to be distinctive, but only because they have different ideas on how best to realize the grand formal architecture and fine details of a composer's work. They are, with more or less humility, interpreters. And despite the efforts of living composers, most of what classical musicians interpret is from the repertory, not new work.,In jazz, the performer trumps the composer. Jazz musicians do treat some material with reverence, but they can also bring to it irony, bemusement, savage wit, irreverence or elaborate one-upmanship. Compositions are still important; whether it's Ellington or Monk or Wayne Shorter or Tin Pan Alley standards, jazz musicians prize the combination of musicianly intricacy and indelible melody. But for jazz musicians, the underlying structure is less important than what happens to it on the bandstand. To a form-minded classical listener, the typical jazz structure of theme-solos-theme may be banal. But just as Bach and Beethoven built monumental sets of variations on modest material, a great jazz improviser can turn a trivial pop ditty or a rudimentary blues into an unforgettable performance.,While classical music works toward a finished whole, jazz is about process and interaction: about the thought and reflexes involved when the saxophonist suddenly switches into double time and the drummer answers with an approving flurry of cymbal taps. Classical chamber groups, like jazz quintets, are cooperatives, but they know what notes they'll play before they step on a stage. A jazz group doesn't.,Of course, there's a significant exception in the jazz tradition: big-band music, jazz's orchestral side. Section players, like classical musicians, are expected to play the notes on the page. Big-band composers and arrangers have nearly the same unquestioned authority as classical composers, and they use big bands to explore concepts involving precise orchestral sonorities and large-scale forms. But jazz composers like Ellington always acknowledged that they wrote for performers, not for posterity; they built their pieces around the musicians who would bring them to life, hearing the individual voices in the ensemble work. As they wrote, they kept the music participatory rather than entirely autocratic.,As the ''America's classical music'' line has settled in, jazz repertory groups have established themselves at institutions like Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. They treat important jazz compositions with due admiration and work on some of the same issues -- like historical authenticity versus present-day needs -- that have also engrossed the classical world. That's a worthwhile development; it keeps jazz in touch with its history, gives musicians a stylistic education and makes sure that important American music is heard not as an unyielding recording but with live musicians taking chances. Major works like Wynton Marsalis's ''Blood on the Fields'' and the reconstruction of Charles Mingus's ''Epitaph'' would not be possible without jazz repertory groups. Yet no one pretends that jazz repertory is all of jazz.,Meanwhile, classical music's fascination with form has also been filtering through to young mainstream jazz musicians who are exploring musical structure in small ensembles. Unlike classical composers, they keep their forms volatile, improvising with the shape of a piece as well as with the solos and interplay. But they're not trying to bring back ''third stream'' music, the largely stillborn attempts to unite contemporary classical music and jazz; they're just trying to spur some new improvisational responses. And they don't aspire to the repeatability of classical performances.,As a marketing slogan, the jazz-equals-classical formula is like handing an anchor to a drowning man. It's not as if jazz covets classical music's popularity. Jazz and classical music each account for less than three percent of sales of recorded music in any given year (and less if Kenny G. and the ''Titanic'' soundtrack are factored out). Luckily, both can count on dedicated audiences for live performances.,Still, many potential listeners are put off by the solemnity of classical music. The ritual of classical concert-going -- with a silent audience contemplating a certified masterpiece by (usually) a dead composer -- carries an aura of European elitism, which may well be inseparable from music that long depended on the European elite.  Listeners who do give themselves over to silent absorption of classical music find how gratifying it can be; the music thrives in its formal setting.,But jazz has always been a more informal, more participatory medium, true to the call-and-response of its African ancestry and its roots in parade music and dance tunes. Fans whoop or applaud for a great solo, or laugh at a clever allusion; toes tap, heads bob. Jazz musicians shouldn't have to perform amid conversation -- the best jazz audiences are serious listeners -- but concert-hall decorum can inhibit musicians as well as fans. Positioning jazz as ''America's classical music'' could keep people away from jazz's earthiness and exaltation.,Putting the ''classical'' stamp on jazz is a way of insisting on the music's discipline and significance. Yet jazz is already important without getting all high-toned. One of jazz's all-American advantages is that, like important popular idioms around the world, it rose up from under: out of bordellos and speak-easies, dance halls and rent parties came genius after genius. Jazz legends weren't commissioned by churches or counts; they had more colorful patrons. And in upstart America, an outlaw heritage confers a touch of glamour that jazz should use. Jazz is as complex, intelligent, passionate  and profound as classical music; we know that now. Far from having to borrow status from classical music, it should get respect on its own very different terms.",JON PARELES,"FEB. 28, 1999",MUSIC; Don't Call Jazz America's Classical Music,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-don-t-call-jazz-america-s-classical-music.html
"WHO were the giants of 20th-century composition? Well, it depends on what you mean by giants, and the yardsticks of musical stature are changing all the time.,Thirty years ago, scholarly opinion judged 20th-century classical music on the basis of how far it traveled on the road from tonality (bad) to Serialism (good). The giants formed a tight and exclusive club: Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Bartok, Stravinsky. If you said you liked Rachmaninoff or Poulenc, you branded yourself a philistine or a sap.,Go back another 20 years, and the standard was anti-Romanticism. Stravinsky, Hindemith and Milhaud dominated the textbooks, and if you liked Rachmaninoff or Puccini you were a hopeless Romantic. In the 30's, art was judged by its political content. Shostakovich, once he saw the light, was the model composer for the proletariat, and Rachmaninoff was bourgeois. Go back another two decades, and the test was genius, as measured by originality and force of personality. Richard Strauss and Debussy were the giants, and if you liked Rachmaninoff or Glazunov, you couldn't tell fake genius from the real thing.,Today, few would deny that Rachmaninoff and Puccini are giants, though few would claim that Hindemith and Glazunov are. The rules have changed, and it is hard to say what they are now. Some critics, especially feminists, have held that any ranking of artistic excellence is inherently oppressive and sexist. There is a general skepticism about the way Top 10 lists, or academically speaking, canons, are created and used. But in fact, far from living in an age of free-fall relativism, we have already seen the makings of a new consensus.,The new landscape is visible in these very pages, where jazz, pop and classical articles now share space. The advertisements nearby announce concerts of jazz and popular songs in halls once reserved for the classics. Music today is one interconnected world rather than a constellation of separate spheres.,And with the map of music decisively redrawn, the old guideposts for measuring musical value will obviously be of limited use. Genius, after all, is supposed to be a discredited Romantic notion, though don't tell that to those who recently thronged the Museum of Modern Art to see the Jackson Pollock show. Anti-Romanticism, which Aaron Copland saw as the touchstone of 20th-century music, never appealed to audiences or critics, though composers still seem attracted to it: Minimalism is a late form of anti-Romanticism. The absurdly oversimple story of modern music as the collapse of tonality and the rise of Serialism is also pretty much dead, though few composers have retreated to the harmonic language of Brahms.,Equally dead, at least in major concert halls, is the old avant-garde idea that the proof of artistic greatness is the ability to shock. We've been shocked, thank you.,Clearly, it is time to test some critical values for a musical culture that has broken down the old barriers between high art and low, and more interestingly, between performance and composition. To foster such an exercise, I offer a short and glaringly incomplete list of musical giants, seen from both old and new perspectives. I won't offer a Top 10 list, because lists turn art into homework.,RICHARD STRAUSS -- Old values: Traitor to the cause. New values: Gender researcher, exhibitionist and cross-dresser.,Strauss has been politically suspect since the turn of the century, when he played the role of the philistine instead of the artist-hero he portrayed in his music. After the German defeat in World War I, he was viewed as a relic; after his dangerous liaisons with the Nazi regime, he became an emblem of evil banality. Any composer whose works could survive all of that would have to be a giant.,Strauss's status goes beyond his technical prowess or his way with a waltz. He was the century's great eroticist. He dared to take music into the bedroom, even his own bedroom. In the ''Symphonia Domestica'' he let the musical cameras roll as he and his wife made love, and the music tells all. The Prelude to ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' in its representation of the sexual adroitness of a very young man and an experienced older woman, manages to be clinical and wildly funny at the same time.,More than any other male composer, Strauss celebrated the varied erotic feelings of women. I like to think that as a creative personality, he switched genders midway through his career, going from masculine tone poet to feminine opera maker.,The operas present women of many ages, temperaments and voices, and the music follows the long slow curve of female ecstasy. The most interesting men in the operas are also women, either trouser-roled women like Octavian and the Composer or polymorphously grotesque madmen like Herod and Ochs. The straight men function like straight men in comedy teams or like balletic porteurs. This reactionary was a hundred years ahead of his time. The respectable philistine still shocks.,THE TUNESMITHS (Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Harold Arlen) -- Old values: Tinsel makers unless they went classical. New values: The real Les Six.,One of the persistent dreams of 20th-century art music was the creation of non-art music, music that would fit right into everyday life. Satie, the godfather of the French composers known as Les Six, called it ''musique d'ameublement,'' furniture music, wallpaper music. Hindemith called it ''Gebrauchsmusik,'' useful music. Most of Les Six (including Poulenc and Milhaud) also pursued this goal, but they were doomed to failure. No matter how hard they tried to produce non-art, it came out as art music, for better or worse. We listen to Satie's furniture music, even though we know we are not supposed to, and Poulenc's intentional banalities are far too elegant and cleverly contrived to remain banal. Hindemith's useful music has turned out to be pretty useless, except for violists.,Few 20th-century art composers have had a real gift for everyday music; to put it another way, the people who did have this gift went into popular music. They made the artsy, utopian dream of everyday music a reality and, to a great extent, also took over the religious function of classical music. Irving Berlin's songs were like benedictions. They turned the events of everyday life -- drinking coffee, talking on the telephone, getting dressed up, dancing cheek to cheek -- into rituals.,In the past, classical music performed this sanctifying function: we still depend on Wagner and Mendelssohn for weddings, and Elgar for graduations. But Irving Berlin created an entire hymnal of secular anthems. We use his songs to mark the seasons (''Easter Parade,''  ''White Christmas''), to celebrate the nation (''God Bless America''), even to sanctify the act of singing a song (''Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ''There's No Business Like Show Business''). The other tunesmiths followed suit, giving us songs for summertime, stormy weather and Valentine's day, for lonely nights, casual flings and love at first sight. It is a mistake to call this music vernacular; it translated the bible of modern life into a new vernacular.,LOUIS ARMSTRONG -- Old values: A great trumpet player and entertainer; not a classical giant. New values: The man who reunited composition and performance.,Louis Armstrong a composer? He did write a few songs, but he also composed every time he picked up his horn. His choice of notes and the way he shaped a musical line influenced every jazz and pop performer to come. His impact went far beyond jazz. He changed the world's sense of rhythm. He changed the sound of the trumpet. He changed the sound of the singing voice. He redefined the musical expression of happiness for the first time since Haydn.,Like Berlin, Armstrong reclaimed an aspect of classical music that 20th-century art music had lost and was unable to find. Armstrong made the performer a creator again, not a recreator. He redefined virtuosity in a way that makes even the greatest classical soloists seem sterile in comparison. While classical musicians became increasingly inhibited in their interpretations by fidelity to the printed score, Armstrong made every performance an act of reshaping the original into something new, even when he was singing it as written.,Armstrong's genius for on-the-spot composition brought wit and spirit to songs that had seemed lifeless. His performances restored the relation between composition and performance that once existed in the art of the great opera singers, piano virtuosos and organ improvisers. And they exposed the deadening literalism that passes for interpretation in the classical world.,DMITRI SHOSTAKOVICH -- Old values: A conservative; maybe a bad guy, maybe a good guy. New values: The J. S. Bach of the 20th century.,These days when people speak of Shostakovich, the conversation immediately becomes political. Was he or wasn't he? I leave the question to others.,As a composer, I am more intrigued by the way his music is anti-Schoenberg than by any way in which it might be anti-Stalin, for Shostakovich proves that Schoenberg was both right and wrong: right when he said that there was still much music left to be written in C major; wrong when he thought that the 12-tone system would give music an order equal to the older tonal practice. Schoenberg's atonality pulled his music away from the past, for all his love of the tradition, and from popular music. Shostakovich's tonal approach reconnects concert music to the past and at the same time to jazz and popular song.,I begin every day by playing a Debussy prelude, a Ravel waltz or minuet (the fast pieces are too hard) and a Shostakovich fugue (well, one of the easier ones). Shostakovich connects the present to the past: the awful present, the terrifying present and the consoling past. His fugues follow the same rules as Bach's, not just the strict devices of fugal constuction but also the even stricter demands of tonal harmony, which Shostakovich stretches without ever breaking.,Shostakovich was the most profound conservative of the century. His belief in the language past was so strong that he could use it without irony to express a world of feelings Bach would never have imagined. When I want to leap away from harmonic certainty, Shostakovich reminds me of all that I am giving up.,ARNOLD SCHOENBERG -- Old values: Terminator of tonality, emancipator of dissonance, creator of the 12-tone method, the composer from hell. New values: Action painter.,Serialism is dead, and Schoenberg should be the god that failed. Performances of the music, like the recent ''Moses und Aron'' at the Metropolitan Opera, seem to strain the critical thesaurus for grudging praise to the breaking point. Why didn't the critics just come out and say they hated every minute? No one I read saw the unique quality that keeps the music maddeningly alive: Schoenberg's music is really tolerable only when it is extraordinary. Only when you get to the impassioned violin line at the very end of ''Moses und Aron'' do you suddenly understand why you have been so bored by the hollow technical bravura of the previous two hours.,When Schoenberg was inspired, he could turn out a half-hour opera in a couple of weeks. He was a volcano that erupted erratically and incandescently; his music either singes your eyelashes or just lies there, dormant. The writer of this century Schoenberg most resembles is his fellow autodidact D. H. Lawrence, who was similarly pedantic and preachy when uninspired, but unmatchable when the lightning actually struck.,Schoenberg's best music, for all his talk about the great German tradition, is musical action painting, the notes flung on the page white-hot. Schoenberg admitted as much when he wrote that he often set texts to music as he read them, without knowing how they would end. But the best single example of a Schoenberg thunderbolt is a brief piano piece (Op. 23, No. 2). The Schoenberg who lives on is the composer who could take such a flying leap and leave his parachute at home.,IGOR STRAVINSKY -- Old values: Great Russian, pretty good rootless cosmopolitan. New values: Mr. Cool.,More than Schoenberg, Stravinsky represents the ''problem'' of modern music. Schoenberg's music was always a little weird; it just got more so. By contrast, Stravinsky gave sophisticated listeners the thrill of a lifetime for the first 15 years of his career, creating works that shocked and rocked one day and were classics the next.,Then something went terribly wrong. He turned himself into a glacier, calving a glistening masterpiece every year that dazzled composers and choreographers but left concert audiences cold. Making things worse, he rubbed audiences' noses in his new-found hauteur, dressing like a dandy, lecturing like a stuffy professor, even composing an oratorio in Latin and a ballet full of echoes of Delibes. It was all a pose, but audiences rarely got the joke. He was cooler than thou then, and he remains Mr. Cool today.,All the composers I know have Stravinsky's music in their blood and brain cells, but audiences still resist most of the music he wrote after ''Les Noces.'' With stunning recent recordings conducted by Robert Craft and Oliver Knussen, and a Stravinsky festival planned for June by Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony, we may be on the verge of a Stravinsky revival that will push the musical world toward post-post-modernism.,Stravinsky's music never says, ''Love me.'' His cool, his edge, separates his art from everyday music, demanding that we stop what we are doing and indulge ourselves in a world of wit, elegance, humor and, at times, tenderness. His cool is a frame for an art that is always ''high,'' even when it is intended for circus elephants or a Broadway show. Once the music world has got beyond antimodernist accusations and recriminations, it may even find itself cool enough to dig Stravinsky's act. Until then, just put on a recording of ''Dumbarton Oaks,'' and see if he's still cooler than thou.",DAVID SCHIFF,"FEB. 28, 1999",MUSIC; A New Measure for Heroes in Music's Valhalla,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-a-new-measure-for-heroes-in-music-s-valhalla.html
"MUSIC lovers rarely have a chance to be voyeurs. But ''Great Pianists of the 20th Century on Film,'' a Lincoln Center series that has run for the last month and ends today, has given audiences at the sold-out Walter Reade Theater a glimpse of what performers look like up close and has on occasion let the same audiences overhear what pianists say about what they do.,Sixteen programs and, by my count, 59 pianists have offered interviews, musical snippets, sometimes complete pieces, even complete sonatas or concertos. Briefly, people were able to watch Paul Wittgenstein butcher Ravel's Left-Hand Concerto in silence; butcher, at any rate, in the opinion of the composer, who, helpless before the pianist's contractual rights as commissioner of the piece, could do nothing to stop the bloodshed. The conductorial hands seen in the film were Ravel's own.,Lincoln Center's inclusions have been as remarkable as the several prominent absences. Searches of film and television archives turned up no Rachmaninoff. Nothing, either, from Walter Gieseking or Dinu Lipatti. Sviatoslav Richter and Vladimir Horowitz, on the other hand, are everywhere. Horowitz became a virtual one-man media industry in the 1970's and 80's; Richter, despite protestations of puritan reclusiveness, seems to have placed himself in front of cameras at every opportunity.,We should be grateful for what Lincoln Center and its curator Allan Evans have turned up. Historians did them no favors. Getting the films here took sweat and serendipity; obtaining the rights was a gargantuan effort, played out many times in many places. We may never see some of these items again.,There have been delightful appearances from pianists on the margin of fame: Yvonne Lefebure, the teacher of choice in my days at the Paris Conservatory, and Guiomar Novaes, a Brazilian who in the postwar years played Schumann as gracefully as anyone who ever lived. (Her excerpts here were mostly Chopin.) One relished bedrocks of German style like Wilhelm Kempff, Edwin Fischer and Wilhelm Backhaus. Clifford Curzon, Solomon and the disgraced collaborator Alfred Cortot have appeared; also, Benno Moiseiwitsch and Mieczyslaw Horszowski.,The post-Liszt school of virtuosity was represented by Ignaz Friedman, Vladimir de Pachmann, Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhevinne. There have been exotic birds like Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and Samson Francois; also, the eminent Soviet-era teacher Heinrich Neuhaus. Add to them an evening of jazz, including the 20th century's master of omission, Count Basie.,The ground rules for these events were curious, for here was often a live audience witnessing a filmed audience witnessing a performance. The nature of public playing, Claudio Arrau said in an interview, is the one-time nature of the exchange between player and audience. Yet here was unrepeatable spontaneity being repeated spontaneously again. No one, at least, seemed to insist on sitting at the left of the hall to watch the pianist's hands.,Mr. Arrau at one point addressed the ever enigmatic question of composer and interpreter, and how much of each should go into what the audience hears. Fifty-fifty was his answer: an unsatisfactory one, but then, so is every other. Perhaps the pianist was talking more to himself than to us.,Bernard Gavoty, Ms. Lefebure's television interviewer, took up the argument with words like ''execution'' and ''interpretation.'' But such verbal delicacies seemed less an explanation of musical performance than a descent into intellectual self-abuse. Language-obsessed as they are, the French have a hard time with music criticism and insist on translating musical thought into literary thought.,It was certainly the right place to ask such questions. The series, by definition more about musicians than about music, begged them. In terms of repertory, there was little to amaze the ear. Chopin showed up 44 times, Beethoven 20, including 4 concertos (the Fourth twice) and 14 sonatas (the ''Appassionata'' three times).,No explorations here; rather, well-traveled repertory used to to demonstrate the pianist's acumen. No surprises either. The culture of recordings has already turned us away from discovery and toward comparative shopping. It was hard not to overhear ardent cogniscenti in the lobby arguing the merits of Myra Hess's Opus 110 versus Lefebure's. (Not a word about Beethoven's Opus 110.),The idea of composer as prop was abetted by some strong performing personalities. Richter's enormous assets, grimly applied, were a powerful presence: uniformly menacing, always deserving of respect, hardly lovable. Richter seemed to crush music with his integrity.,I wish I could speak more lovingly of William Kapell's appearances. I remember his electric energy, but electricity could not rescue performances of Scarlatti and Chopin that had little grace or color and only a halting sense of continuity. Kapell was magnetic for the excitement he generated in up-tempo music, and then there was the sad romance of his early death at the beginning of a successful career. Public reputation can be vague: Kapell on so many lips; Novaes, infinitely more talented and also well recorded in her time, virtually forgotten.,DID we ever attain Arrau's ''50 percent solution''? We came close in Lefebure's masterly organization of Bach's A minor Organ Fugue (BWV 543, in the Liszt arrangement). Arthur Rubinstein may have done it outright when he played the Chopin Barcarolle for an audience in St. Petersburg. Rubinstein raised his hands, and all the silliness of ''execution'' versus ''interpretation'' faded away.,For the playing of a piece of music is not the superimposition of an artist's personality on the composer's; nor is it a balancing act between the two. It is the executant's response to the music's concrete statement of needs.,How naturally, indeed how amorously, Rubinstein bent to the harmony's gravitational pull; how naturally he felt the end of a phrase when he was at its beginning. Witnessed here was something simple, divinely so: a song without words and a musician under its spell.

"THESE haven't been the best of times for Monica L. Tripp of Columbus, Ga. ''It's been an awful year -- I now hate telling people my name,'' said Ms. Tripp, who happens to have a 7-year-old daughter named Chelsea.,Since Monica S. Lewinsky and her loyal friend Linda L. Tripp became household names, Monica Tripp, 33, a 911 dispatcher, has had to endure a constant barrage of crank calls, sophomoric jokes, sexual innuendo and brazen leers. ''Even my co-workers give me flak, always asking, 'Where's your blue dress?' '' she said.,Many a Monica and a lot of Lewinskys have been accidental victims of a scandal that has produced few heroes. ''Monica Lewinsky has actually cost me money,'' complained Marisa Lewinsky -- no relation -- a psychology student from Florida. To thwart obscene phone callers, Ms. Lewinsky now subscribes to caller I.D. ''Not a week goes by without someone making a crude comment,'' added Ms. Lewinsky. ''People have even told my boyfriend: 'Hey, you're set. You must get a lot of oral sex.' The first joke was funny. It gets old fast.'',For the record, Monica Barrett, 38, a paralegal in Wisconsin, doesn't own a dry-cleaning business. (Wacky Monica jokesters will often ask about this.) ''I used to answer the phone at my law firm: 'Hello, this is Monica speaking. How may I help you?' '' Ms. Barrett said. ''Nearly every time I did that, I'd receive some sarcastic comment, mainly from men. They don't realize that what they're saying is hurtful and demeaning. I mean, I'm not Monica Lewinsky. We just share a first name.'',Pre-scandal, the moniker Monica enjoyed a pristine, even pious standing, having been long associated with Saint Monica, Augustine's devout, overbearing mother. The New Dictionary of Baby Names concludes, rather arbitrarily, that the name Monica evokes a ''frighteningly healthy, pig-tailed girl.'',Not anymore. ''Giving a Monica'' and ''the full Monica'' have become part of the vernacular, stigmatizing, perhaps permanently, a perfectly upstanding name.,''I expect a moratorium on baby Monicas for the next 30 years,'' said Anne Bernays, co-author of ''The Language of Names.'' The numbers seem to back her up. In 1997, Monica was the 73d most popular girl's name; it had fallen to 97th place a year later, according to the Social Security Administration. Still, Ms. Bernays offered encouraging words: ''Hold your heads up high, Monicas. Anyone, even Adolfs, can transcend a name.'',Why all the gibes at Monicas' expense? ''The name makes all sorts of lights go on in the head,'' explained Steven Stroessner, a social scientist at Barnard College. According to Mr. Stroessner, the Lewinsky scandal lurks in the memory, poised to erupt whenever discipline flags. ''We have so many associations about Monica that you almost can't help but have thoughts activated,'' he said. ''Whether we blurt them out or not is another matter.'',Jean L. Cohen, a professor of politics at Columbia University and author of a forthcoming book on sex and the law, judges anti-Monica outbursts as aggressive, sexist behavior. ''Sexual jokes and comments are rarely good, chummy fun,'' argued Ms. Cohen.,''The traditional gender roles have been destabilized,'' she added. ''The real Monica couldn't be cast as innocent victim or evil seductress. She was an agent of her own sexuality. That makes men uncomfortable. How do they deal with that uneasiness? They can't attack Monica Lewinsky, so they express their discomfort by putting down some random Monica.'',To combat the problem, two lawyers in Milwaukee -- neither named Monica -- recently founded Monicas With Attitude, a consciousness-raising group.,''Women named Monica will band together,'' declared its mission statement, ''celebrate their names in a positive way and develop activities that will preserve and promote the good reputation that so many earlier Monicas have enjoyed.'' The organization's latest campaign: a boycott of ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' which it accuses of misogynistic Monica-bashing.,SOME Lewinsky namesakes have devised their own strategies for coping with wisecracks. Marisa Lewinsky smiles broadly before revealing her name to strangers. ''It disarms people, makes them less prone to be rude,'' she said. Since taking her husband's last name when she married five months ago, the former Monika Lewinska, a 24-year-old from Poland, has cut her grief in half.,Not one Monica interviewed for this article has seriously contemplated changing her name legally. Monica Monica, an ophthalmologist from New Orleans, is running for the Republican nomination in the upcoming special election to fill the House seat of Robert L. Livingston, the Speaker-designate who resigned, a casualty of the Lewinsky scandal. Ms. Monica considers her double moniker an asset.,''On the campaign trail it has evoked curiosity and attention,'' she noted. ''It's a wonderful way to open doors. There are many Monicas, from Monica Seles to Monica, the singer, to Monica, the character on 'Friends,' who love the name. If a negative perception exists, we are going to change it.'',With the scandal lingering on life support, some Monicas expect the unwanted attention to die down. ''In a few months,'' mused one Monica from New Jersey, ''Monica won't be a thought in people's minds.'',Don't bet on it. Charles (call me Chuck) Manson, a customer service representative at a New York computer company, still endures frequent taunting even though his namesake nightmare began 30 years ago.,''I always tell people my name, then follow it up with, 'No relation,' or, 'I've never killed anyone,' '' he said.

"THESE are some of the things we think about when we think about female beauty, according to a new book, ''The Survival of the Prettiest'' by Dr. Nancy Etcoff: parasites, low androgens, nullaparity. That whirring sound you're hearing when contemplating the appearance of another is coming from within. It's your ancient reptilian mind, sorting data and selecting, tediously, for sex. Not for pleasure, just plain old reproductive sex, wherein you succumb to your DNA's demands.,Clear skin makes you swoon because it is parasite-free (always a plus in a mate, don't you think?). Tiny chins, a trait of individuals with low levels of androgens, or male hormones, are also attractive, because they mimic the proportions in a baby's face, reminding you of another biological must: protect the young. A high waist-to-hip ratio is a third biggie, maybe even the prize in the Cracker Jack box. It is the formula for a Barbie hourglass torso -- the shape of an uninhabited womb, otherwise known as the nulliparous female.,These are among the conclusions collected in Dr. Etcoff's book, a kind of scientific survey with cultural analysis of the universal attraction to, well, attractiveness. Dr. Etcoff, a psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a teacher at Harvard Medical School, marshals a gruesome number of studies proving the world loves a babe. You've heard of most of them before: beautiful children are called on more in school, beautiful adults are favored for jobs, and they make more money than their doggy counterparts. Folks are just plain nicer to the beautiful.,In one study cited, two women waited by the side of the road, each next to a car with a flat tire. The better-looking one was picked up first. Surprise! Even babies will gaze longer at more attractive faces.,What links the Maxima reader to the reader of the Borneo equivalent of The New York Review of Books, Dr. Etcoff says, is an interest in the parts of human physiognomy that suggest reproductive fitness. Because certain body types and facial shapes are universally attractive, she concludes, notions of beauty are not generated by society or culture. In other words -- hold on to your hair -- biology is destiny. And ''The Beauty Myth,'' Naomi Wolf's 1991 book that convinced a new generation of feminists that the cosmetics industry was anti-woman, gets a pummeling. Yawn.,Here are other facts from ''Survival of the Prettiest'': Studies show that animals, including human animals, are attracted to that which looks most like them (quails, since you asked, will stare at their first cousins longer than they will at birds that aren't related). But when there is competition for partners -- ''the precondition for Darwin's sexual selection,'' Dr. Etcoff writes -- sex markers tend to become exaggerated, and you get the peacock's gaudy tail. Or Liv Tyler's lips.,''I wrote the book because I felt that there wasn't any true intellectual discourse on beauty,'' Dr. Etcoff said the other day from her perch on a velveteen banquette at 44 in the Royalton Hotel in Manhattan. ''There's so much study on the subject -- the biology of beauty, the politics of beauty -- but no attempt at synthesis. I also wanted to counter the beauty-bashers.'' That is, Dr. Wolf and others who argue that beauty is ''socially constructed.'',Dr. Etcoff, in town to promote her book, was a little breathless, having come from the Betsey Johnson fashion show, which in her view was an exuberant display of beauty in the service of status. ''We watched the entire Tyler family,'' she said. Those lips again! ''And we all watched Lou Reed sleeping in the front row.'',''The Survival of the Prettiest,'' published by Doubleday and whose subtitle is ''The Science of Beauty,'' wasn't born in a vacuum. The field in which Dr. Etcoff fits, evolutionary psychology, is buzzing now. The discipline applies Darwinian principles to seek the roots of human behavior.,Dr. Jacque Lynn Foltyn, a sociologist at the University of Redlands, near San Diego, is finishing her own book, ''The Importance of Being Beautiful,'' in which she ''definitely takes exception with the view'' of the evolutionary psychologists, she said. Dr. Foltyn explained: ''A lot of the research seems to me to be incredibly sexist, and generalizes a lot from animal studies, and it just isn't borne out by empirical research.'',Dr. Foltyn said that 20 years ago, when she was an undergraduate researching beauty, it wasn't such a hot topic. ''Since then there's been an explosion,'' she said. ''Why is beauty important? Why did the beauty stakes go up? Here's where the beauty evolutionists are wrong. The value of beauty is always changing in a society. And sometimes, beauty is selected against.'',If this academic back and forth makes you want to take a nap, you are not alone. Like the topic of killer storms, books about the scientific and cultural basis of beauty have become a familiar publishing niche, one that has already jogged the careers of Ms. Wolf, Camille Paglia (''Vamps and Tramps'') and Nancy Friday (''The Power of Beauty''). Cynthia Heimel, the author of ''Sex Tips For Girls,'' said: ''I sort of feel like, duh, no kidding!'' Can't somebody make some interesting conclusions?'',The debate over whether biology or culture determines beauty standards is a soporific even for those whose job it is to care. ''Oh, that again,'' groaned Linda Wells, editor of Allure, the beauty magazine. ''Doesn't it just make your eyelids droop with ennui?'',I'm not saying that our sexual preoccupations aren't worth talking about. It just seems, as Ms. Heimel pleaded, that the conversation needs to be smarter. Or maybe just simpler. Some of the most interesting conversations are going on between painters, canvas to canvas. Look at the work of Lisa Yuskavage, who paints anatomically distorted women with the bodies of sex toys, or John Currin, who depicts Venus as a Breck girl, to see how conventions of beauty can slide into freakishness.,Another nice place to start might be in Dr. Etcoff's laboratory at Massachusetts General. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology, she is mapping the parts of the brain aroused by beauty. ''We're guessing that it will involve the face-recognition places, as well as those parts of the brain connected with craving and pleasure,'' she said,The storm in the brain. That's the ticket. I like this idea of mapping the brain more than I do the calculation of beauty extrapolated from the vogue for tiny chins or big eyes or clothes that show your belly button.,After dinner with Dr. Etcoff, we strolled over to the grim crush that was the Marc Jacobs fashion show. Churlish fashionistas in black down jackets pressed against us, as even more churlish security guards pressed us back. We looked in vain for beauty on the runway, but it was too far away, and all we could see were the models' eyes, set and hard and squinting a bit.,Bruised and shaken, we staggered out into the night. A photographer caught my elbow. ''Child,'' he said, shaking his head, ''you won't find what you're looking for here.''",PENELOPE GREEN,"FEB. 28, 1999","MIRROR, MIRROR; Biologically Speaking, Isn't She Beautiful?",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/style/mirror-mirror-biologically-speaking-isn-t-she-beautiful.html
"A FEW years ago, my wife, Christine, and some colleagues had an emergency at work. One man suggested an outrageously expensive solution. My wife said that there must be a cheaper way. He shook his head, saying, ''Money is cheap; it's time that's expensive.'',Which means most of us are very poor. If anything is universal among the butchers, bakers and automobile makers, it is that they are all spending incredible amounts of time at work, which is leaving everyone with little for the things that really count.,It seems as if everyone is working hard to pay for a house in a neighborhood with good schools, a comfortable life and then college for the children. So we're not getting home for dinner, sometimes not for the kids' bedtime. Then they see us with a cup of coffee in the morning, and we're out the door again.,Time isn't just expensive; it has become priceless. So we ask a question with no easy answer: What is more valuable to us and to our children's development? The money we earn from working so much, money we hope will get them through a private university? Or would they be better off growing up with less, but with parents who were home more?,''That is a critically important question, said Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute in Manhattan. ''We should not have to wait until we have a critical illness or a life-altering event to ask if we are living life to its fullest.'',When I have to teach my grade-school daughter, Marian, how to send a fax to my office so I can help her with math homework, it's a good time to reassess.,EVERY parent I know frets about this issue. But most, like me, do little about it, because our economic responsibilities are so daunting. Some companies have shortened the work week to allow more family time, but such moves are rare and not always popular. The Kellogg Company was a pioneer of the shorter work week in the 1930's, but according to Benjamin Hunnicutt, a historian at the University of Iowa who wrote ''Kellogg's Six-Hour Day (Temple University Press, 1996), the company abandoned it in 1985. ''The men, especially, wanted the longer week,'' he said. ''They would rather go to the plant than go home. Work was their identity.'',Juliet B. Schor, the Harvard economist who wrote ''The Overspent American,'' says she understands why parents want to work so hard. Poor parents can improve their children's lives once they can afford better neighborhoods. And just about every parent wants to give the children the educational tools to compete. ''If you have a view of the world that only the top third of the population is going to get a good job, you can see why families are making sure their children are in the top third,'' she said. ''It's a highly competitive economy.'',But as we work harder, we also spend more. Here, she said, we may be making the wrong choice.,''Consumption norms have increased pretty dramatically the last 15 to 20 years,'' she said. ''Part of that has to do with the kind of things that people are providing for their children'' -- like bigger homes, travel and more consumer goods. ''As a society, it would be better to work less and spend more time connecting socially.'',Mr. Hunnicutt said that during this century, the reasons we work have changed. We're not working just for necessities anymore. For many, he says, work has replaced religion in providing meaning in life. ''We are now getting beyond economics,'' he said. ''The thought was that as we got enough, instead of larger houses and more things to eat, we would turn to those freer parts of our life, such as the family and the community. That hasn't happened. We are left with empty front porches. We had living rooms where families talked. Now we have television.'',Ms. Schor points to a 1995 study by one of her students, showing that the less time parents spent with their children, the more they spent to buy them items like videos and toys. The more time, the less money. Absent parents felt guilty, the student concluded.,Ms. Schor said these parents are on a dangerous course. ''We have to ask ourselves, as a society, 'Do we want to be substituting a video for ourselves?' '' she said. ''Do we think that is a good trade-off?''",JAMES SCHEMBARI,"FEB. 28, 1999",MIDSTREAM; A Price Not Paid in Money,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/midstream-a-price-not-paid-in-money.html
"Michael St. Clair, director of the Babcock Galleries in Manhattan for 40 years and an influential dealer in American art, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86 and also had a home on Fire Island, N.Y.,A dapper, exquisitely mannered man who rarely talked about himself, Mr. St. Clair was one of the deans of American art dealers. His main accomplishment lay in reviving, through exhibitions and publications at his gallery, the reputations of several neglected American painters, including the early 20th-century modernists Alfred Maurer and E. Ambrose Webster and the Impressionist Childe Hassam. But it was the legacy of Marsden Hartley that Mr. St. Clair probably affected the most, partly because he was able to acquire so many of the artist's works,  and partly because Hartley's achievement sustained the most dramatic upward re-evaluation.,Mr. St. Clair was born in Bradford, Pa., and grew up in the oil fields of Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, where his father worked. Intent on becoming a painter, he studied with Thomas Hart Benton at the Kansas City Art Institute from 1934 to 1939, and then with George Grosz at the Art Students League in New York and with Boardman Robinson and Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Colorado Springs Art Center. In the early 1940's he was director of the Works Project Administration Art Center School in Oklahoma City and had his only solo show there, in 1942, at the Oklahoma Art Center.,During World War II, Mr. St. Clair served with the 328th Fighter Squadron in North Africa and Europe, earning a silver star and three bronze stars for bravery during a battle near Salerno, Italy, in September 1943.,After the war he settled in New York City and pursued painting for more than a decade, supporting himself as a window designer and also as a private art dealer. In 1959 he joined Babcock as director and subsequently purchased the gallery, which was founded in 1852 and is the country's oldest commercial gallery devoted exclusively to American art.,That same year Mr. St. Clair also took over the Hartley estate from the dealer Paul Rosenberg, who had become frustrated by the lack of interest in the artist's work. Mr. St. Clair drove to Maine and acquired the works held by the artist's executor, returning with a small truck full of Hartleys. The works ranged from the artist's exuberant semi-abstract ''German Officer'' paintings of 1914-15 to the soft elegiac landscapes and stark portraits from the years before he died in Maine, in 1943.,Between 1959 and 1980, Mr. St. Clair mounted 11 Hartley exhibitions and began carefully placing Mr. Hartley's work in public and private collections. He ultimately sold Hartley paintings to nearly 70 museums, often earmarking certain paintings for specific museums long before the museum showed any interest in the artist. In 1978 the Whitney Museum of American Art staged the first Hartley retrospective in a New York museum in more than 30 years.,The living American artists Mr. Babcock exhibited in his gallery included Ben Ben, Bessie Boris, Jerome Hill, Byron Burford, Margo Hoff and Stephen Edlich. He remained involved with Babcock, which was purchased by John Driscoll in 1988, until recently and was an adviser on its current exhibition of Hartley prints.,In 1998 Mr. St. Clair established the Babcock Galleries Endowed Fund for Art History at the Department of Art History at Pennsylvania State University. He is survived by his companion, Paul M. Jones.",ROBERTA SMITH,"FEB. 28, 1999","Michael St. Clair, 86, Dealer In Unsung Artists of America",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/michael-st-clair-86-dealer-in-unsung-artists-of-america.html

"An armed man attacked two women and stole money from a theater early yesterday, and Bergen County authorities began an intensive manhunt for the suspect, who was seen by the victims and at least two other witnesses. In both attacks, the man held a silver or gray handgun, possibly a .25-caliber pistol, the Bergen County Prosecutor, William Schmidt, said.,In the first instance, the suspect accosted a woman inside the Highway Theater in Fair Lawn at 12:05 a.m., held a handgun, and ordered, ''Do what I say,'' the authorities said.  The woman broke free and ran away. The man then stole $3,500 from the theater. He drove away in a bright blue two-door 1988 or 1989 Chevrolet Cavalier with a luggage rack on the trunk.,Less than an hour later, the man followed a woman who was driving home, the authorities said.

But after she  walked through the door, she shoved him back through a screen door, ran inside and slammed the main door shut, locking it.,The man fled in a Chevrolet that matched the description of the car in the first attack, Mr. Schmidt said.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"FEB. 28, 1999",METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW JERSEY; 2 Women Are Attacked By Man Wielding Gun,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/metro-news-briefs-new-jersey-2-women-are-attacked-by-man-wielding-gun.html
"IN Paris one summer, my husband, Michael, and I were sitting on the sunny steps of the plaza outside the Musee d'Orsay, having just spent hours glutting ourselves on the Impressionist paintings. Like our fellow footsore tourists, we were thumbing through newly purchased postcards and art books. Suddenly, a van pulled up, the rear doors opened and two skinny youths in T-shirts pushed an upright piano onto the pavement. The pianist produced a stool, plopped himself down and began to play a riff, while his companion assembled a clarinet. Soon, the squiggles and syncopations of jazz and honky-tonk entertained a delighted audience who rewarded them with a large pile of francs.,We have a phrase -- ''the mind's eye'' --  for remembered sights, but no such expression exists for sound. Whenever Michael and I travel, we dutifully preserve the views in photographs, which we eventually plaster into albums. But it's the musical experiences, both planned and serendipitous, that often evoke the most pleasurable memories: the nostalgic notes of the odd oboes and brass playing the sardana in front of Barcelona's cathedral; the mellow tones of the artful flutist in a Roman metro passageway; the robust oompahs of a band in the Strasbourg town square; the icy tremolos of Vivaldi's ''Winter'' played by a chamber orchestra in the church of St.-Julien-le-Pauvre in Paris.,Every European city abounds with old cathedrals, through which tourists doing the requisite sites traipse; some might find it almost impossible to transcend the crowds  and get a true sense of the spiritual. In Salzburg one summer, turned off by the commercialization of Mozart -- they even sell Mozart balls, chocolate confections wrapped in foil decorated with a portrait of the impoverished composer -- we took a detour from the throngs pressing us through Mozart's birth house and alighted on a pew in the spacious Franciscan church. Drawn in by the churning notes of a Reger fantasia that an organist was practicing, we listened while he repeated passages in different registrations, sending his assistant scurrying back and forth to check the sound. Tributaries of musical lines flowed into one grand river.,As New Yorkers, we often go to Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall to revel in the sounds of some of the world's great orchestras from cities like Berlin, Cleveland, Vienna and Philadelphia. But there is nothing like hearing an orchestra on its home turf. A few years ago we flew to Amsterdam on a brief trip and, though jet-lagged, were enthralled by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra's nuanced performances in its richly resonant hall, the Concertgebouw. At one point, the harpist gently, almost imperceptibly, plucked the ultimate note of a diminuendo, which wafted toward us in the balcony in soft distinctness.,A few years ago, while roaming the lush grounds of Fontainebleau, the splendid chateau a short jaunt outside Paris, we heard the faint, sweet strains of Debussy. Was it our imaginations imbuing the landscape with the appropriate auditory effects? We followed the acoustical trail, arriving at an obscure wing of the chateau. Piano music emanated from one of the rooms, and we spotted a French horn player packing up his instrument. He explained that we had stumbled upon the practice rooms of the American Conservatory of Music and that on that very evening there was to be a faculty concert. Would we like to come? Gladly, we said. There was just enough time to grab a snack close by and return for the recital.,The concert featured a dazzling flutist who had just resigned from the Orchestre National de France to pursue a solo career. Afterward, we introduced ourselves to the musicians and were invited to dine at the faculty-student dining hall. While I conversed with the musicians in French, my monolingual husband, a retired professional violinist, and the school's Francophone theory teacher began to whistle passages of Debussy's ''La Mer'' and Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' to and fro across the table. The surrounding chatter subsided as the students and faculty members became mesmerized by the impassioned exchange of musical excerpts.,Music can often infuse a site with a certain texture. A flute and guitar jazz duo that transformed our Paris metro ride and the instrumentalist playing ancient airs on an assortment of old rebecs, viols and a hurdy-gurdy near the entrance to Strasbourg's cathedral come to mind. It was music that drew us two nights in a row to the same outdoor restaurant on the cobblestone plaza  of the main cathedral in Granada in Spain. The paella the first night and roasted pork the second somehow tasted more authentic,  accompanied by a guitarist's renditions of Granados, Albeniz, and Falla. In Paris, the peaceful ambiance of the Place des Vosges on a warm summer evening was enhanced by an impromptu string chamber group performing under the square's vaulted archways.,On another sultry night, we were savoring our Berthillon ice-cream cones while strolling on the Pont St. Louis. From somewhere came the echo of haunting strains unattributable to any musical instrument we knew. Planted in the middle of the bridge was a man with a tray. Approaching, we noticed that the tray was arrayed with partly filled water glasses of many sizes -- a glass harmonica. He gently stroked the rims, teasing out the melodies and exotic chromatic harmonies of a languid Ravel waltz.,IN my mind's ear some humorous musical experiences also resonate. In London, walking through the Victoria Embankment Gardens, we happened upon what was meant to have been a serious outdoor performance of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' in the band shell, presented by three amateur singers with piano accompaniment. In the final act, the soprano committed the requisite suicide a bit prematurely. After plunging the ceremonial dagger into her abdomen, she slumped to the floor, and then, realizing her mistake, suddenly popped back up to warble her final notes.,A few years ago, we heard a concert at Bargemusic in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. A violist in an advanced stage of pregnancy serenaded the audience with a Brahms sonata. Since the barge sways when jostled by the wakes of passing boats, she had removed her high-heeled sandals and continued barefoot. The sky in the picture window behind her darkened into summer umber to the deep notes of her viola. We were on the river, a special place where eye and ear become one. Nestled in the barge's moorings beneath the looming bridge, we rocked gently on the soft swells.",BARBARA COMINS,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Melody Lingers On,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/travel/the-melody-lingers-on.html
"THE Federal Reserve is worried about unleashing inflation. But makers of semiconductors and computers are in bitter pricing battles.,Unemployment is at historically low levels. But companies are aggressively seeking mergers so they can dismiss workers and keep costs low.,The economy is growing more quickly than anyone expected. But Wall Street is worried that corporate profits are not rising fast enough to justify current stock prices.,These peculiar relationships between the financial markets and the economy can be summed up using the Hopi Indian word ''koyaanisqatsi,'' which means, roughly, ''life out of balance.'',''I believe the way the economy is being driven now is 180 degrees opposite from how it was driven for more than 40 years after the end of World War II,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''We are used to having excess demand and a shortage of goods, so whenever we had faster growth, we got rising inflation. Now, it's falling prices that are stimulating the economy. I call it a deflationary boom.'',Last week, bond traders seemed to be following their instincts and the familiar rules. Signs that the economy was growing faster than expected led to fears of a revival of inflation. Traders sold bonds -- and yields, which move in the opposite direction from prices, rose to their highest level in six months.,Higher yields, in turn, are bad for stock prices, because investment managers who have been paying 70 times earnings for shares of a fast-growing technology company are more likely to weigh that relatively high valuation against the new, lower price -- and lower risk -- of bonds.,''If we get a couple more strong economic indicators coming out in the next few weeks, we could see long-term rates up close to 6 percent,'' said John Y. Kim, chief investment officer at Aeltus Investment Management, a subsidiary of Aetna Inc.'s Retirement Services unit. ''That could cause real problems for the equity market, because that could cause asset allocators to edge out of equities and into bonds.'',The equity market is probably not on the verge of collapse, but after a strong run in the first two months of the year, stock prices are stuck or declining. The price-to-earnings multiples that investors are willing to pay for fast-growing technology companies are falling. And until the Federal Reserve makes clear its intentions on interest rates, investment managers are likely to be more choosy about where they advocate putting the nation's retirement money.,Individual investors should take a similar look at their portfolios, which after the big run in equities over the last four years may be out of balance, too heavily tilted toward stocks.,A bigger portion of the financial assets of the nation's households is invested in stocks than at any time since the end of World War II, according to Federal Reserve statistics. And the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, reported last week that the portion of mutual fund assets invested in bond funds fell below 15 percent last month. That is a record low -- roughly one-third lower than the level of four years ago, just after the bond market rout of 1994 and just before the stock market began its upward march.,Vanguard Asset Allocation, which in the last five years has been one of the most successful mutual funds at divvying up money among stocks, bonds and cash, has 40 percent of its $7 billion in bonds, with the rest in stocks, Thomas F. Loeb, the fund's co-manager, said last week.,Mr. Paulsen said that now might be a time to err on the side of caution. ''I'm very much a bond bull,'' he said. ''My stance is to be much more diversified this year. And with bond yields at the high end of their recent range, bonds offer a good value again.''",EDWARD WYATT,"FEB. 28, 1999",MARKET WATCH; The Echoes of a Deflationary Boom,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/market-watch-the-echoes-of-a-deflationary-boom.html
"INSURANCE is like broccoli. It's good for you, but many people find it bland.,Still, lots of savvy investors are piling insurance company stocks into their portfolios as the number of companies peddling the stuff shrinks. Last year was a record for insurance company mergers, according to Securities Data, a Newark, N.J., research firm, with more than $100 billion of transactions completed worldwide.,According to the experts, that trend is almost certain to continue. Michael Frinquelli, a partner at Renaissance Fund Advisors, a New York investment fund that focuses on companies that stand to benefit from consolidation in the industry, took time last week to look at the dealing, and at who might be next.,Q. People justify banking mergers by saying there are too many banks. Are there too many insurance companies?,A.  Yes. There are roughly 7,000 licenses to sell one form or another of insurance in this country. About half of these licensees are active, operating companies. But the economics favor the biggest companies.,Let's take auto insurance as an example. Five companies control 60 percent of the business. Then you have another 2,000 or so that are fighting for the other 40 percent. Slowly but inevitably the rest has been going to the top five, largely because auto insurance is a business of scale, and the big companies have lower expense ratios.,Q. Cost-cutting is a mantra that is recited by managements in many industries. Why is it so important in insurance?,A.  In property and casualty insurance, the business is simply not growing. The absence of inflation has reduced the need for insurance. When home values go up, you are insuring the value of the house. But when that stops happening, the cost of insurance, or total premiums being brought in, is not going to go up. From the mid-1960's to the mid-1980's premiums grew about 9 percent a year. In the 1990's, it has been about 3 percent a year.,In life insurance, the important thing is how do you sell the product. Years ago, life insurance was sold through captive agents. But now, life insurance is as much about selling a retirement savings vehicle as it is death protection. With the aging of the country, there is more interest in saving for retirement than protecting the family.,In effect, that means you are competing with mutual funds as much as other insurance companies.,Q. If banks have their way, they will be able to sell insurance, too. If Congress goes along, what sort of impact will that have on the industry?,A. The proposed changes in bank legislation have more to do with life insurance than property and casualty insurance. If the legislation ever gets through Congress, there will be major events in the life insurance business in the year 2000 and beyond.,I think banks will fall all over themselves to buy life insurance companies. But I don't think they will be interested in property and casualty companies, because it isn't a very attractive business.,In property and casualty, you have to be willing to say no. And if you say no to someone on auto insurance, for example, then you might lose other business.,Q. How many more acquisitions will there be? And which companies have developed the best acquisition strategies?,A.  There may be another dozen combinations among the big companies. But there are a whole slew of smaller companies just waiting to get picked off. There are literally hundreds of those that will be acquired over the next three to five years.,As far as who is being smart about what they are buying, two Bermuda-based companies, Exel and Ace Limited, have come up with good acquisition strategies that add to earnings immediately and add to their distribution or product platforms either in the United States or globally. Shares of both companies trade here.,American International Group hasn't done much by way of acquisitions, but what they have done is brilliant. Their purchase of SunAmerica was expensive, but it gave them a door into the retirement savings business in the States. But because they are global, it allows them to introduce SunAmerica's products to the rest of the world.,Q. Are there other companies that you expect will be active acquirers?,A.  The other two I would mention are All-State and Hartford Financial Services. To date, AllState has done nothing in the acquisition area, and Hartford relatively little. But we keep waiting.,Q. How about targets in the insurance brokerage or reinsurance businesses?,A.  Aon is a pure insurance brokerage play. Marsh & McLennan has Putnam Investments, so it does more than just brokerage. But reinsurance would be a lovely business for banks to get into: Everest Re is the most obvious candidate left.",KENNETH N.

"MAYOR GIULIANI made a New Year's resolution to share some of the credit for the city's rejuvenation, acknowledging that it takes more than a mayor to raise up a city.,Mr. Giuliani will get a chance to make good on that pledge this week, when he presents the annual Sloan Public Service Awards to eight city workers.,This year the awards, which are sponsored by the Fund for the City of New York, honor a firefighter with the spirit of Thomas Alva Edison and a warehouse manager with a gusto for efficiency.  Other honorees include a court liaison officer who juggles dozens of cases of probation violators and a deputy commissioner helping to overhaul shelters for the homeless. Each winner receives $7,500.,Since starting at the Fire Department in 1978, Lieut. Timothy J. Kelly, 43, has had what firefighters call a ''knack for size-up.'' When he arrives at a fire, Lieutenant Kelly has a sense of what strategy and tools to use. But he doesn't just think of the tools he already has. He dreams up ones that don't exist.,In February 1995, Lieutenant Kelly, a lieutenant and a decontamination specialist with the Special Operations Command, was called to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where firefighters at a blaze were covered with asbestos. At the scene, Lieutenant Kelly found it difficult to get lights into the park. Afterward at his Roosevelt Island office, he began to draw a plan for a hand truck outfitted with a detachable generator and powerful lights.,Today, the Fire Research Corporation of Nesconset, N.Y., manufactures the Kelly Kart, the offspring of that office doodle. Since September 1997, the city has used the Kelly Kart at several emergencies, including last summer's elevator collapse at the Conde Nast tower in Times Square.,''I know what it's like to be in a fire without light,'' Lieutenant Kelly said. ''I know it will save some lives and protect property.'',Injured in January 1998 after he leapt onto a fire truck to secure a falling light, only to slip and fall, Lieutenant Kelly will retire next month. The city will feel the loss, said Chief Raymond M. Downey of the Special Operations Command. ''If you had a business and needed five people you would only need two Tim Kellys,'' he said.,The fund will also honor two officials who are improving city services in less dramatic  ways. During the last five years, Marcia Stevenson, a deputy commissioner in the Department of Homeless Services, has helped bring in nonprofit organizations to take over the daily operations of shelters.  Now Ms. Stevenson, 56, is overseeing another transformation in the shelter system:  instead of checking in for ''three hots and a cot,'' people at the shelters must work at finding jobs, addressing substance abuse problems and resolving other troubles that have led them to homelessness.,This mission, which is based on new policies of both the city and the state, has put Ms. Stevenson in the crossfire between politicians and advocates for the homeless. But she has won praise from colleagues for bringing these camps together and for being flexible, fund officials said.,''A procedure or policy is a piece of paper which represents your best judgment at the time,'' Ms. Stevenson said. ''Within a few months there are indications of how you need to tinker, and you have to be willing to do that.'',Like Ms. Stevenson, Donald Campbell has had to overcome suspicions. Mr. Campbell, 52, the director of the central storehouse for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, has consolidated the warehouses of six city agencies into one depot. Mr. Campbell has 2,500 types of items spread across his 500,000-square-foot fief in Middle Village, Queens.,He stocks everything from No. 2 pencils to 55-gallon drums of oil to 80-pound bags of rock salt. Despite agencies' concerns that service would decline, Mr. Campbell said, the new system has improved the availability of supplies and cut costs as well.,''Instead of running their own warehouse,  they can come to us,'' Mr. Campbell said.,The fund will recognize other winners, not for a specific accomplishment, but for their exemplary work in the face of huge and often disheartening caseloads.,Edna Muriel, the only H.I.V./AIDS nurse clinician at Bellevue Hospital Center, walks  the halls with her beeper practically punctuating her steps. Many days she is a slave to the beeper, as patients, doctors and family members vie for her attention, intellect and sympathy. Miss Muriel, 45, has called on more than medical expertise in her 10 years of counseling patients. Some of her charges are unemployed, others have no insurance.,''These patients require lots of support,  and a lot of these people have no support,'' Miss Muriel said.,Every day, Wayne White seems to sprint from one courtroom to the next at Manhattan Supreme Court, his arms wrapped around case files. Mr. White, the court liaison officer for the Department of Probation, handles up to 50 cases a day of convicts who have violated the terms of their probation.,At hearings, Mr. White, 33, supplies information about each case, offering exhaustive reports to the judges who prefer comprehensiveness and pithy summaries to those who like conciseness. ''We work for the judges, we try to get them everything they want,'' Mr. White said. ''Is a guy reporting, is he doing what he's supposed to, is he working? I try to give that extra effort to get the extra information.'',In a system burdened by an expanding caseload, Mr. White's thorough work has won judges' admiration.,This year, one prize morphed into three, recognizing the leaders of the appeals division of the Law Department. Leonard Koerner, division chief for 20 years, has  argued cases before the United States Supreme Court five times and has shaped the city's law and lawyers. His career highlight is a 1978 United States Supreme Court victory that gave the city the power to make Grand Central Terminal a landmark.,A defeat, Mr. Koerner said, ''would have undermined and done away with landmark preservation around the country.'',''It gave cities, including New York, the ability to preserve historic structures,'' he said.,Mr. Koerner, 56, will share the honors with his two deputies, Stephen J. McGrath, 49, and Frank Caputo, 52. Mr. McGrath, who specializes in tort law, struggles to undo costly verdicts that juries have decided against the city. He recently succeeded in  overturning a $30 million judgment against the Board of Education.,''That's an area that is always growing,''  Mr. McGrath said of tort suits. ''Everyone seems to sue.'',Mr. Caputo, procedural expert and legal scholar, handled a 1986 case involving a challenge by theater owners to the city and state plan to redevelop Times Square. Mr. Caputo won, clearing away one of the last legal hurdles to rebuilding the area.,But the three lawyers don't have time to dwell on past victories. Their work is constantly growing.

"THE nonstop season is about to engulf Gary Cohen.,Mr. Cohen, a five-year resident of this community, has begun his 11th year as the radio voice of the Mets. In addition, he broadcasts all St. John's University basketball games and the N.C.A.A. tournament. In about 10 days, all will be crowding into the same spot on the calendar.,The Mets will be playing exhibition games. St. John's, one of the top teams in the country, is certain to be in the N.C.A.A. tournament and is likely to stick around for a while. And the entire three weeks of the tournament known as March madness looms on Mr. Cohen's travel schedule.,''March is a bit of a whirlwind,''  Mr. Cohen, relaxing at home here, said. ''I'll do all the St. John's games as long as the team is in the tournament, and where the schedule permits, I'll spend as much time as possible in Florida with the Mets. It's obviously a fun time, too.'',Not for his travel agent.,''The toughest was last year at tournament time,'' Mr. Cohen said.  ''I was at the Winter Olympics in Japan. I flew home for 27 hours, then drove to Syracuse in a blizzard for an N.C.A.A. tournament game.,''But it's a relaxing time in a certain way, too. You're preparing for an all-out assault on baseball, seven days a week, for a full season.'',And through it all, a major goal is ''to spend as much time as I can at home.'',Home is with his wife, Jean Bratman, who, as a singer-songwriter currently preparing her first album, also uses her voice for her work. She has sung the National Anthem before Mets games.,And home is where 7-year-old twins, Trevor and Kira, romp. Both have already shown an artistic bent.,''We wanted to go beyond the suburbs, to get some land,'' Mr. Cohen said of the choice of South Salem.  ''It's a wonderful community. I'm sure we'll be here forever.'',For the twins' parents, it has been a twisting road to South Salem since Ms. Bratman, a Barnard student from the Washington area, and Mr. Cohen, a Columbia University student from Queens, met at WKCR, the Columbia radio station.,''We pretty much knew right away,'' Ms. Bratman said of their romance. She also pretty much knew it would mean evenings apart. ''He's sort of been preparing for this his whole life,'' she said.,Mr. Cohen, 40, said: ''Actually, growing up in Queens and rooting for the Mets, I always wanted to be a shortstop for the Mets and a power forward with the Knicks. Those weren't going to work out, so announcing was the best other thing.'',That announcing is crisp, professional and knowledgeable and delivered in a friend-talking-to-a-friend style. And his completeness and sense of history are invaluable in baseball, a leisurely game with lots of nonaction air time to expose those not immersed in the sport's lore.,''He describes every last thing to you,'' Chris Leible of the Mets' public relations staff, said.,Mr. Cohen's drawn-out description of an in-doubt home run -- ''It's . . . OUTTA HERE!'' -- has become a fan favorite.,''I love hearing Gary do baseball games,'' said Ms. Bratman, who loves baseball, too. ''He makes it so exciting.'',Exciting but impartial. No root, root, root for the home team.,''We don't do that in New York,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''I grew up listening to Marv Albert: you play it down the middle.'',Mr. Cohen's career did not start in New York. There were stints behind the microphone for the Durham Bulls and the Pawtuckett Red Sox, both minor league baseball teams, as well as doing basketball and hockey for Providence College.,Durham, N.C., is, of course, the setting for Kevin Costner's classic baseball movie ''Bull Durham.'' But Ms. Bratman remembers it for other reasons.,''The day after our honeymoon,'' Ms. Bratman said, ''he went to Durham for five months, and I had to stay in Norfolk for my job.'',Such things could happen anew with the next generation.,''My son has already told me he wants to be a baseball announcer for the Mets,'' Mr. Cohen said.,'' 'And if I can't,' he said, 'then I want to be a major league baseball player.'

"MEMORIES of Mount Vernon flowed as the palm trees swayed. It was Mount Vernon Day in Florida and 635 people gathered at the Crystal Lake Country Club in Pompano Beach to reminisce about their hometown.,Some remembrances were more recent than others. ''I just left New York two days ago,'' Nancy Shea Webster said.,The reunion has become so popular that people who live in Mount Vernon travel to Florida for Mount Vernon Day. ''I like to see everybody,'' said the retired Fire Chief, Henry Campbell, who also traveled from New York.,So why not have a Mount Vernon Day in Mount Vernon? ''Because nobody's up there,'' Rose Kaplan Levine of Delray Beach said. ''Everybody's down here.'',For the few who are not, the day is held during winter school vacation, this year on Feb. 17, ''so that more can come,'' said Ruth Kaplan Weiser, the co-chairwoman of the reunion. John Branca is the co-chairman of the event.,And they do. From New York and all over Florida. ''Roots are roots,'' said Richard Limato, a former lieutenant in the Mount Vernon Police Department. ''And Mount Vernon is home.'',Home, he added, is where the heart is. Although the hearts of many of these New Yorkers now beat in Florida, Mount Vernon remains their hometown. To pay tribute to it, they traveled to Pompano Beach -- in Cadillacs and Camrys, by plane and train.,Men wore dark suits and pastel blue jackets. Women dressed in cocktail black and aqua pant suits. Although the temperature was 75 degrees outside, Betty Gayle wore her mink jacket. ''Because it's cold in here,'' she said. Florida air-conditioning can rival a frost-laden  Westchester morning.,Those attending this year's Mount Vernon Day included  Mayor Ernest D. Davis, a former Mayor, Ronald A. Blackwood, and a soon-to-be candidate for mayor, City Controller Maureen Headley Walker, who said in an aside in Florida that she would run for mayor in Mount Vernon  this year. ''I haven't made a public announcement yet,'' she said. ''But I am going to run in a Democratic primary against the mayor.'',When told of her plans, Mayor Davis looked at the sea of New York faces and said, ''She's probably not the only one.'',Mount Vernon Day started 27 years ago as a way for those retired in Florida to get together. With each year came more expatriates, as Roland Joffe calls himself and the others. The event grew and grew until finally those left in Mount Vernon started asking why  the retirees in Florida should have all the fun.,Residents began traveling to Florida for the day, which is actually an afternoon filled with a reception, lunch and dance. If they sent their checks by Jan. 17, the cost was $23 a person. Late reservations cost $30.,The event has grown so large that the committee coordinating it now holds it only every other year. ''It was a lot to organize,'' Mrs. Weiser said, ''and we are all in advanced ages.'',Some of the original founders are dead, she added, and their children now help in the planning.,''The day is really for anybody who has had anything to do with Mount Vernon,'' Stan Wolar, another organizer, said. ''You could have lived there, gone to school there or worked there.'',Mr. Joffe added: ''I now have 3,500 names in our database. This year we have people from the high school classes of 1929 through 1979.'',There was also a 1994 graduate -- Todd Prattella, son of Dr. William C. Prattella, the former Superintendent of Schools.,Dr. Prattella was one of those honored at this year's event. He retired in 1997 after 25 years, the longest term in one district for a superintendent in New York State, he said. Although he and his wife, Mary, have a condo in Boca Raton, this was their first Mount Vernon Day in Florida. ''I just saw someone I haven't seen since I was 10,'' he said.,As the City of Homes, as Mount Vernon sometimes refers to itself, met the land of condos, there was shrieking and hugging. Frank Grieco approached his former high school friend Michael Ferraro. ''We graduated together,'' Mr. Grieco said. ''It was the class of '46. Or was it '47?'',''It was '46,'' Mr. Ferraro said. They headed off together. A few minutes later Mr. Grieco returned, alone.,''We're embarrassed,'' he said. ''We figured it out. We graduated in 1947.'',Memories can blur but friendships remain. There was a police table. And a firefighters table. Past and present teachers and school administrators mingled with government employees.,Shaking hand after hand was Ms. Walker, the Controller. ''I send out the checks,'' she said. ''A lot are sent to pensioners and retirees in Florida.  It's good to put a face to a check.'',One of those retired is the gregarious Mr. Blackwood, Mount Vernon's Mayor from 1985 to 1995. He now lives in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. ''I miss my city,'' he said. ''And my friends and the relationships I've built over 40 years.'',As a man hugged Mrs. Weiser (''He was my neighbor,'' she explained), she added: ''We all have such wonderful memories of Mount Vernon and lifelong friendships.'',In the dining room, Mount Vernon street signs hung over the tables:  Gramatan Avenue, Fleetwood Avenue, Hartley Park.,Sitting under Memorial Field was Beatrice Alperin Freedman of Delray Beach. ''I remember the free concerts there when I was young,'' she said.,On each plate rested a chocolate-dipped strawberry, courtesy of Michelle Satriale Palisi, class of '64. ''I now own a chocolate store in New Port Richey,'' she said. ''I decided to give back to Mount Vernon. So I got up this morning at 7 and dipped 690 strawberries.'',''The band leader, Norm Green, came from Mount Vernon too,'' Mrs. Weiser said.,Next month the Pompano Beach Country Club will be the site for Yonkers Day, with 500 transplanted New Yorkers expected. But on this day everything was about Mount Vernon, the home of Lillian Vernon,  the catalogue company, and such celebrities as Dick Clark and Denzel Washington.,It was also home to Mr. Joffe and his wife, Ruth, who last year moved full time to Longboat Key in Sarasota. ''I'm now president of the Longboat Key Lions Club,'' Mrs. Joffe said, ''the first woman president in its 40-year history.'',Life is good in the sunny South. But what did she miss most about Mount Vernon? ''My daughter,'' she said. ''Barbara Joffe. She is a teacher there at the Lincoln School.'',Many in the crowd spoke of their children's successes as well as their own. Belle Sheiner was the former president of the Mount Vernon Federation of Teachers. ''I'm still president,'' she said. ''But now it's of my condo association.''",DIANE KETCHAM,"FEB. 28, 1999",Love of Mt.

"A Promising White,Sauvignon blanc, 1997, Jamesport Vineyards. (About $12.),Over time, Jamesport has demonstrated an aptitude for sauvignon blanc. The character of the wines has varied, of course, with agricultural conditions and winemakers' different techniques and emphases.,Sean Capiaux's current version, tasted while in a sleepy phase of its maturation, seems promising, especially as an accompaniment for shore lunches and dinners.,With dainty pineapple in the aroma and delicate herbal notes, the wine's main story for now is a refreshing acidity that aroused an enormous appetite and kept it going full speed ahead. It's an easy-drinking, casual white that needs only a moderate chill to do its life's work properly.,Incidentally, taking the second syllable of its name seriously, Jamesport has released a port -- a white called Anna, named for a daughter of Ron Goerler, an owner. Made from the pinot blanc grape, and showing mild pearlike and grapey aromas and flavors, it has a nice velvet texture. At 18 percent alcohol, it alleviates chills fast. It's dry enough to be an aperitif but would go nicely with vanilla ice cream. About 30 cases of the original 40 remain. The 500-milliliter bottle, sold only at the winery, costs $16.   HOWARD G.

"VISUALIZING the dim, dank shell of the building at Mitchel Field as anything other than an abandoned airplane hangar takes a lot of imagination. No problem for Bonnie Thompson Dixon. She barely notices the old, wrecked police cars, the wet cement floor, the junk strewn about the cavernous hull.,Instead, Mrs. Dixon envisions a bright, open, two-level, 40,000-square-foot space. The ceiling's gone, the truss exposed.,She sees children running about this phantasmagorial edifice, their parents and caregivers in tow, blowing Hula Hoop-sized bubbles, laughing and giggling by a wave tank in one area, busily building a sand dune or shaping a sandy beach in another.,Mrs. Dixon's reverie is not far-fetched. As executive director of the Long Island Children's Museum, she has been studying blueprints, formulating plans, discussing prototypes for exhibits and spearheading a capital campaign for a new $15 million facility at Hangar 6, part of the new Museums at Mitchel Center complex. It's a huge leap from the museum's current site, a 5,400-square-foot space leased from Keyspan inside an office building on Stewart Avenue in Garden City.,The Long Island Children's Museum will be the only private institution at the Mitchel Field museum row. The Grumman Imax Theater, Cradle of Aviation Museum , Firefighters Museum and the relocated Nunley's Carousel are all Nassau County-financed projects. Last June, the county gave the Children's Museum a 60-year rent-free lease, including utilities, and is investing $3 million in roads and infrastructure.,Construction on the new museum, however, won't begin until the bulk of the $12 million in private funds are raised, said Mrs. Dixon, perhaps as early as this spring. The not-for-profit institution is scheduled to open in 2001 with 250,000 to 500,000 visitors expected annually.,Only 98 visitors at a time fit in the existing space; many more are turned away at the door.,'Children's museums all around the U.S. are bursting at the seams,'' said Robert Lemle, the museum's president and one of its founders as well as executive vice president and general counsel for Cablevision. ''It's fun. Parents are looking for something like that. There is no easily accessible large children's museum in the New York area other than the Brooklyn Children's Museum. This museum will be very easy to get to and it's also part of Long Island's history.'',There are half a million children under age 12 on Long Island. ''The people who know us best are this high,'' Mrs. Dixon said, holding her hand at waist level. ''They don't write the checks.'' Nor do they come to the museum alone. So the hands-on facility -- where grandchildren often teach grandparents how to use a touch-screen computer, grown-ups fit inside undulating bubbles and parents often grab the anchor's chair in a mini-television studio -- is really an intergenerational place.,''To put an exhibit together that can entertain and excite a 2- to 12-year-old is a feat in itself; we have to make sure the parent is also engaged,'' said Mrs. Dixon as she tried to blow a bubble through a frame of string and plastic straws. ''Sure we go to the beach a lot and we go to the movies, but we just share popcorn there. We really don't share ideas. This is a place where families can share ideas and learn together. Even though we call it a children's museum, it's a family museum.'',But not a museum in the traditional sense. The exhibits are not about science or history or art, children aren't reading labels and nobody's lecturing. Instead, on a recent afternoon, 7-year-old Michelle Smith of Hicksville was on borrowed crutches, hobbling around ''What If You Couldn't,'' an exhibition area that allows school-age children to experience what it's like to have a disability. Her fellow Brownie troop 3284 member, Jennifer Rooney, was testing a walker.,Over in the bubble area, Alexandra Romano, a third grader from Our Lady of Mercy School in Hicksville, didn't realize she was learning physics when she stuck a wet hand through a bubble screen without making it pop. ''I like it,'' she said. ''It's neat.'' Meanwhile, Kathleen Pollet, 8, was examining X-rays at a display about hands.,''Children learn by doing,'' Mrs. Dixon said. ''Part of our development process is to prototype exhibits and let the kids play with them before we go into our final production. Inevitably, children will create ways to play with things that adults would never think of.'',Twelve interactive exhibits are being built simultaneously for the new museum, including new versions of existing displays, said Al Jarnow, an artist who produced films for ''Sesame Street'' and created much of the museum's interactive software. The hands exhibit will evolve into a gallery that starts with the human body and stretches to include scaly, prickly, slimy and fuzzy creatures. At his Northport studio, Mr. Jarnow is designing Sandy Island, ''about Long Island and the gestalt of sand.'' In the current Protozone, children are already unknowingly debugging components for a new pattern studio. And there will be a Splashzone, an area where children can create waves, ripples and currents, make fountains and float boats.,''We need to move to grow because we can't accommodate all the people that we want to have come visit,'' said Mrs. Dixon. ''We need to grow because we have so many more ideas.'',Love in the 80's,Watching her guests gather in the lobby of the Mayfair, a residence for the elderly in Glen Cove, Peggy Kaufman admitted she was just a tad skittish.,''Usually the mother takes care of the daughter's wedding,'' the 80-something bride said last Sunday, nervously adjusting the white satin yarmulke that served as a veil and matched her coiffed hair and brocade suit. Instead, her daughter, Cookie Martin, a party planner from Port Washington, was helping her.,Just then, the 86-year-old groom, Gerald Shaw, who had spent a relaxed morning reading the newspaper and adjusting the tie on his tuxedo shirt, wrapped an arm around Ms. Kaufman and kissed her cheek.,It was time to shuffle down the aisle.,When she moved to the retirement home a year ago, the possibility of romance wasn't exactly on Ms. Kaufman's mind. A widow for more than 20 years, she was looking forward to the companionship and amenities of retirement community living.,She didn't think that would include marriage.,''I just didn't want to cook and clean anymore,'' she said.,Mr. Shaw, however, had other priorities. Lonely since his third wife died three years ago, he came to the home in search of a mate. The odds were stacked in his favor. Sixty-four women and 18 men, including a few married couples, live in the building.,And Ms. Kaufman, seated four seats in front of him on a bus outing to see Christmas lights, was a dream come true.,''I fell in love with her, in plain English,'' he said.,Coincidentally, both had fled to the United States from Nazi Germany; he from Leipzig in 1938, she from Dresden in 1941. He settled in New Jersey; she in Port Washington. Both enjoyed collecting stamps and photography.,''He very much wanted to meet someone,'' said his niece, Debby Goore of Muttontown. ''That was why we thought it would be a good idea to move here.'',A month ago, they got engaged, but only after Mr. Shaw struck out with another resident, Hannah Printz, 91. ''He was after me first,'' Ms. Printz said. ''I didn't want him, so I introduced him to Peggy.'',Mrs. Martin ordered imprinted ''Peggy and Gerry'' wedding napkins and a white chocolate two-tiered cake with pink roses on top. ''It's very rejuvenating,'' she said. ''It makes you feel very young. You can see the gleam in their eyes.'',After the ceremony, Ms. Kaufman threw the bouquet to her 25-year-old granddaughter, Tracey Martin.,''It's perfect; it's about high time,'' said Mr. Shaw, his arm snug around his wife's shoulder as she showed off her new diamond wedding band at a champagne reception. He planned to move into her one-bedroom unit for their wedding night. Later, they would switch to a more spacious, two-bedroom unit, she said.,The newlyweds plan to spend their honeymoon cruising on the Queen Elizabeth 2 in July. And to have a long, happy life together.,''Since they've gotten together, it seems to be O.K. for romance now,'' said Marilyn Brenner, assistant executive director of the Mayfair. ''We have a lot of people that feel good about one another. Other couples are talking a little bit more and getting together.''",MARCELLE S.

So when the Pittsbugh Symphony Orchestra commissioned him to write a piece for its youth orchestra that would introduce children to classical music and relate music to the general community, he came up with ''Hosedown,'' which had its first and so far only performance in 1994 in Pittsburgh. Eager to pay tribute to Gould, a Great Neck resident who died in 1996, Tilles will devote the latest entry in the series Stage Two: The Arts Start Here to the work's New York premiere.,Performed by the Gemini Youth Symphony, ''Hosedown'' will be part of a multimedia event on Saturday, complete with firefighters from Roslyn and Great Neck.

"WILLIAM G. CONWAY had driven all night from Chicago, and he was lost in the Bronx. The streets were stone empty and seemed eerily endless. Suddenly, he heard a siren, and he was arrested for drifting through a red light. ''I almost turned around and went back,'' he said.,But he stayed, rising from No. 2 bird curator at the Bronx Zoo in 1956 to captain of one of the biggest wildlife conservation and exhibition juggernauts in the world. By 1966, he was head of the zoo. Just four years later he was at the helm of the Wildlife Conservation Society, the zoo's parent group, founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society by Theodore Roosevelt and members of New York's philanthropic class.,During the last decade, Mr. Conway has presided over what may be the biggest expansion, at least in acres, of any city cultural institution. The Conservation Society has taken over zoos that the city could no longer manage: the Central Park Zoo in 1988, the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Zoo in 1992 and the zoo in Prospect Park in 1993. Flashy new exhibits have been added at the Bronx Zoo and Coney Island Aquarium.,Attendance at the zoos and aquarium grew to 4.4 million last year from 3.1 million in 1988, as the society's budget shot up to $78 million from $38 million. With city support receding, private fund-raising doubled, to $21 million, while Conservation Society membership tripled to 94,625.,Mr. Conway plans to retire by year's end, and go out with a roar. His most audacious exhibit, the Congo Gorilla Forest, is scheduled to open in June at the Bronx Zoo, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. Costing more than $43 million, Congo will be the most expensive animal exhibit in city history, displaying more than 20 gorillas, 35 other species of animals and 400 kinds of plants. At 6.5 acres, it will be bigger than the entire Central Park Zoo.,Yet the old zoo men -- or silverbacks as they like to call themselves, in honor of dominant male apes -- mourn the impending loss of their leader. ''Bill is the guru of our profession,'' said Ed Moluska, director of the Cincinnati Zoo. George Robb, director of Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, called him ''the leader in terms of maintaining the relevance of our institutions in modern society.'',Mr. Conway said he was retiring because he had told the chairman of the society's trustees a decade ago that 70 sounded like a proper retirement age. ''I made a terrible mistake,'' he said, perhaps jokingly. ''I should have said 95.'' But it was his choice, and the current chairman, David T. Schiff, says it remains his choice. A search committee has been formed to find a successor.,Yet his legacy will remain. Mr. Conway has transformed the Bronx Zoo from a place where lions prowled cages in neo-classical buildings to one where animals can be seen in naturalistic settings without bars. He has turned the zoo into an educational outpost, keeping attendance fees relatively low. Though adults paying $7.75 might beg to differ, the San Diego Zoo charges $22.,Mr. Conway has also pursued a grander goal: preserving wildlife from extinction by pushing the Conservation Society deeper into faraway jungles, deserts and swamps to learn how to save threatened species. The society now has 326 conservation projects in 52 countries -- more than all the other zoos in the United States combined -- compared with 70 in 32 countries a decade ago. And he has revolutionized zoo keeping, successfully urging American zoos to share animals for breeding.,For all his status in conservation circles, though, Mr. Conway is little known to most people. His biggest public flap was his much criticized attempt in 1993 to remove the word zoo from the society's zoos because he claimed that the dictionary's secondary meaning of zoo -- ''rampant confusion or disorder'' -- made it inappropriate.,The battle ended in something of a tie. The name Bronx Zoo, which society officials say is good for advertising, remains on the sign, but in smaller letters below ''Bronx Wildlife Conservation Park.'' At the Central Park, Prospect Park and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park zoos, the Z-word is absent.,Mr. Conway regrets that he will be leaving with an unfinished agenda. He yearns to turn the old monkey house into an ''Invertebrate Empire'' and the old lion house into an environmental education center. And he wants to try evening hours at the zoo.,Still, there is Congo. Mr. Conway is like the master planner with whom he used to do business, Robert Moses, in that people tend to agree with him, city and society officials say. The city has consistently forked over money -- including $10.6 million for Congo -- with few questions asked.,In part, this is a result of Mr. Conway's razor-sharp negotiating skills. Parks officials still complain that he bested them on terms for the society to take over the zoos. He is quick to play the trump card that zoo animals can die if animal experts are not allowed to proceed exactly as they wish.,Mr. Conway also argues that zoos will lose their moral imperative if they shrink from addressing the extinction issue, a point he is trying to make with the Congo exhibit. It will be the first special exhibit at the Bronx Zoo to charge extra, an additional $3 on top of the regular zoo admission fee. Visitors will be asked to use voting machines to specify which African conservation project will get their $3, thus linking the urban zoo to a threatened environment.,It is hard to find people who will openly criticize Mr. Conway, though stories abound about the intimidating effect he can have. It is said, for example, that when he remarked at a meeting that the weather was cold for November, nobody mentioned that it was  December. And while he seems quite willing to let everyone address him as Dr. Conway, his three doctorates are honorary.,In keeping with his tweedy persona, Mr. Conway, who is from Missouri, speaks with a vaguely English accent, pronouncing zebra so that it rhymes with Debra. ''I knew Bill when he said tomayto instead of tomahto,'' Mr. Moluska said.,Mr. Conway's use of arcane words and Britishisms like ''cheerio'' is also fuel for tales. Dan Maloney, vice president and curator of the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans and a former Conservation Society employee, said that when Mr. Conway was almost run over by a zoo worker's truck, he shouted: ''You scoundrel! If you ever drive like that again, I'll have your head!'',He is also known for his immensely serious demeanor. ''I can't think of a funny thing about him in all the years I've known him,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, who described his more naturalistic exhibits as ''small animals tastefully hidden.'',Yet Mr. Conway can also be fierce like a righteous lion. The president of the Denver Zoo, Clayton Freiheit, remembers him attacking the head of another zoo, at an American Zoo and Aquarium Association meeting, for planning to import a rhinoceros species that zoos had agreed to leave in the wild. ''Conway just erupted and said blank, blank, blank, you've go to stop it,'' he said. ''You could hear a pin drop.'',Perhaps the most biting criticism comes from people who hate zoos, Bill Conway's lifelong passion. ''I can't look at a grizzly bear behind bars,'' said Marc Matsil, director of the Parks Department's Natural Resources Group, who once oversaw 12 million acres in Alaska for the National Park Service. ''Watching the sea lions being fed really upsets me.'',Mr. Conway's response was that he wanted to meet Mr. Matsil, and he said that he, too, deeply appreciated the migrations of wildlife through the wilderness. But he thinks zoos can foster support for conservation by enabling people to fall in love with animals they would not otherwise see.,His fascination with animals began with butterflies, which he started collecting at age 4. He chased them around his suburban St. Louis neighborhood, catching them with a net and poisoning them in glass jars. ''It would be harder to do now,'' Mr. Conway said. He presented his butterfly collection to his elementary school as a graduation gift.,He also began hanging around the St. Louis Zoo, riding three streetcars to get to what became a part-time job as a relief keeper. At 12, he had an article about hatching box turtle eggs published in the zoo newspaper. He loved everything about the zoo, even the tricks performed by tigers, elephants, bears and monkeys. ''My perception of trained animals was how wonderful they were,'' said Mr. Conway, who now says he hates circuses. ''Our attitudes toward animals are shaped by our times.'',Mr. Conway, who joined the Bronx Zoo as assistant bird curator at a salary of $6,750, earned his undergraduate degree in biology from Washington University in St. Louis. Public records show that his current annual salary is $270,400.,To be close to the animals, he said, he lived in a house on the zoo grounds for more than 20 years. (He moved late last year, to New Rochelle, N.Y., because of his coming retirement.) His vacations consist of field trips to South America to study his beloved flamingos or work with government officials to set up conservation programs. He and his wife, Christa, a wildlife photographer, have no children. They have had only one pet, a now-deceased parrot named Jimmy, which possessed what Mr. Conway describes as ''an absolutely marvelous disreputable vocabulary.'',So driven is Mr. Conway that people report getting E-mail from him at 4 A.M. ''No one realizes how much he sacrificed to become this incredible icon,'' Mr. Maloney said. But Mr. Conway doesn't see much personal sacrifice. He and his wife never wanted children, he said, and they love to travel together.,There is also a bit of Barnum in Mr. Conway. Disney turned to him for advice in designing its new animal theme park in Florida. Bronx Zoo exhibits like ''Jungle World'' and ''Wild Asia'' helped set the standard for zoo exhibits everywhere, other zoo officials said.,But Mr. Conway's greatest influence may be his intellectual leadership. In the 1960's, he attacked the prevailing secretiveness of zoos in sharing information and breeding, and won acceptance of a radical alternative. Animals are now shipped from zoo to zoo to maximize breeding opportunities and genetic diversity.,The author of more than 200 academic papers for peer-reviewed zoo journals and broader publications like Science, Mr. Conway said one of his persistent frustrations was dealing with ''intellectually impoverished people.'' He cites with amazement a Gallup poll finding that 47 percent of Americans believe humans were created by God during the last 10,000 years in pretty much their present form: hardly the evolutionary lesson he is trying to teach.,Over the years, he has beefed up the society's education program to the extent that children in China follow its conservation curriculum, as do schools in 49 states.,And he takes great pride in the society's conservation and research projects, from saving tigers in Asia to protecting maple trees, which provide wildlife habitats, in New England. ''How can a zoo possibly limit its interest to those animals which it can exhibit within its fences?'' he said, echoing a view held by the society's founders.,Yet conservation issues are often troubling. Take the question of a large swath of land next to Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in the Congo Republic. Congo's Government wants to log the land, and the society has been offering advice on how best to do it. Recently the Government suggested that the society run the project. That would mean one of the world's pre-eminent conservation organizations would log a rain forest. ''Could we possibly do it in a way the public would understand?'' Mr. Conway said at a staff meeting last month. ''Probably not. Could we do it in a way that would be best for conservation? Definitely.'',Another issue he reviewed with his staff involved cave swiftlets in Borneo, birds that use their saliva to build the nests used in bird's nest soup. The society has been working to limit nest-harvesting to sustainable limits. The government proposed that the society do the harvesting and use the profits for conservation. This troubled Mr. Conway. ''We would seem to be making money out of these birds,'' he said.,These days, his major focus is the Congo exhibit. Zoo officials say there have been few disputes over the huge project, but there have been hundreds of thorny questions. What should the fake bugs be made of? Won't monkeys eat that species of fern? A big concern has been keeping up with maintenance elsewhere in the zoo.,Mr. Conway represents a bridge from the swashbuckling adventurers who forged the society into its peculiar blend of conservation and showmanship. He is, he said, the last person at the society personally associated with William Beebe, the legendary naturalist who wandered Asia studying pheasants and once spent a night in the Statue of Liberty's crown to observe migrating birds.,On Wednesday, Mr. Conway took another step into the zoo's future. Donning a surgical mask and a smock, he visited two gorilla families in an indoor space in the Congo exhibit area. The youngsters were playing and wrestling. Big Tim, the silverback and father of 10, finally decided things were getting a bit rambunctious, and lumbered over to pull the squawking infants apart. ''It was quite moving,'' Mr. Conway said.,He couldn't resist a lesson. ''Did you know that the great apes are the only animals besides humans that can recognize a blemish on their faces in a mirror?'' he asked.,BIOGRAPHY: William G. Conway,BORN: Nov. 20, 1929.

Liaisons, like, Dangereuses. The diabolical seducers are not jaded French aristocrats but jaded Upper East Side teen-agers who go to a tony prep school.

"With only a handmade sign taped to its storefront window, the Central Brooklyn Federal Credit Union looks more like the delis and discount stores on Fulton Street than a financial institution. It has irregular hours, and when it is open, customers are not allowed to withdraw cash. The cash machine works, but the credit union has not issued any cards.,Convenience, however, is not the reason that Central Brooklyn's 2,700 members have remained loyal. Founded six years ago by two home-grown Ivy League graduates, Central Brooklyn became nationally recognized as the fastest-growing black-owned urban credit union in the country. Welfare mothers and homeless people opened accounts, as did doctors, lawyers and merchants. Central Brooklyn, in return, provided loans in struggling neighborhoods ignored by most banks.,One of a handful of credit unions chartered in low-income areas in the early 1990's, including one that opened in South Central Los Angeles after the 1992 riots, Central Brooklyn made for a tidy urban fairy tale of downtrodden people empowering themselves, and its young founders were invited to the White House.,But the fairy tale did not last. Central Brooklyn's heady beginning gave way to nagging deficits and, finally, a Federal takeover. Now, after a 15-month conservatorship, regulators must decide Central Brooklyn's fate.,For its members, Central Brooklyn is particularly important because of banks' history of neglecting the poor. With less than $4 million in deposits, the credit union is a speck compared with even small financial institutions. But for the minority neighborhoods it serves, Central Brooklyn represents a measure of self-determination, and its members  have organized petition drives and protest groups to regain ownership.,''People have a great interest in it,'' said Monifa Akinwole, a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident who has led one of the petition drives. ''The institution addressed the needs of the community, which the banks hadn't done.'',The rise, fall and uncertain future of Central Brooklyn is a reminder not only of how few financial institutions choose to aggressively serve poor urban neighborhoods, but also of the undeniable difficulties faced by those that do. The credit union's problems also raise questions about the Federal agency that oversees Central Brooklyn and whether it is willing to, or even should, nurture small institutions that serve low-income areas that other banks largely ignore.,For members of Central Brooklyn, the fundamental issue now is control. By March 23, a newly formed board of credit union members must present a business plan to regulators. At least two other larger credit unions are expected to submit competing merger proposals. Members fear that an outside institution might not heed the credit union's original mission of community reinvestment.,''It was a very exciting notion, and still is, the idea that we would have our own funding institution, the idea that we could have our own economic engine in the neighborhood,'' said Mark Winston Griffith, 35, the Brown University graduate who helped found the credit union and became its first chairman.,National studies continue to show that black people are denied home and business loans far more often than white people. A 1998 National Bureau of Economic Research study showed that black-owned businesses were 2.4 times more likely to be denied a loan than white-owned companies. A 1998 study by the low-income housing advocacy coalition Acorn found that black applicants for home loans in New York City were rejected 2.3 times more often than white applicants.,In the early 1990's, Mr. Griffith was working on community revitalization projects for a nonprofit agency. He and a friend, Errol T. Louis, a Harvard graduate, began to organize Central Brooklyn to serve Crown Heights, Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant and other minority neighborhoods. The two men evaluated the 14 banks serving central Brooklyn and found that they spent only 7.5 cents in home loans for every dollar deposited. Then, in November 1991, Federal regulators closed Freedom National Bank, a Harlem-based black-owned savings bank that had a branch in Bedford-Stuyvesant.,''It helped us draw this picture that we were a neighborhood and a people under siege,'' Mr. Griffith said. ''We were being stripped of any ability to build wealth and build the economic infrastructure of our neighborhood. What was really appealing about Central Brooklyn Federal Credit Union was that it would be owned by the people who were its shareholders, its customers.'',Credit unions must be formed around a group of people with a commonality, such as geography, employment or membership in some sort of association. In the case of Central Brooklyn, the pool of potential customers was the 750,000 residents of central Brooklyn's low-income minority neighborhoods.,Federally chartered in January 1993, Central Brooklyn became an instant success. Large banks like Chase, Chemical and Manufacturer's Hanover pledged ''nonmember'' deposits. By 1994, membership had risen to 1,000 people, then passed 5,000 by 1996 as deposits exceeded $5 million. It cost $5 to join, and members were required to keep a minimum balance of only $10. The credit union made loans as large as $10,000, and as small as $150 to a homeless man for a security deposit on an apartment. The symbolic high point came in May 1994, when Central Brooklyn moved into a bank branch in Bedford-Stuyvesant donated by Chemical Bank.,Mr. Griffith and Mr. Louis were featured in national publications and appeared on public television's ''McNeil/Lehrer News Hour.'' They met with Vice President Al Gore at the White House. But hints of trouble emerged in 1995 when Central Brooklyn failed to pay a dividend. Budget deficits began to follow. Regulators began applying pressure.,In hindsight, Mr. Louis, who oversaw daily operations, said Central Brooklyn grew too fast and tried to do too much. A staff of tellers accepted utility payments, sold money orders and subway tokens, cashed checks and offered youth accounts -- consumer-friendly but unprofitable services. Expenses spiraled out of control, and a plan to compete with check-cashing shops failed miserably. But most of all, Central Brooklyn's loan portfolio, the centerpiece of its empowerment mission, lost money as low-income customers fell behind on payments.,In November 1997, after Central Brooklyn's deficit surpassed $360,000, the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration placed the credit union under conservatorship. Lesia R. Bullock, an agency spokeswoman, said there were no allegations of criminal wrongdoing. But regulators faulted Central Brooklyn's management for inadequate bookkeeping and high expenses, for not being careful enough with its loans, and for failing to aggressively collect them. Nonetheless, the conservatorship infuriated the credit union's board, which had approved a plan to address the problems and to sell its branch building because it had become too expensive to operate.,''The community should have been given the time and space to work out its problems,'' said Clifford Rosenthal, executive director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, an industry association group. ''We thought the credit union and its community board of directors had developed strategies to correct the problem.'',Once in control, regulators drew more criticism. They reduced office hours and prohibited cash withdrawals. (To withdraw money, a member must go to Central Brooklyn, have a teller write a check, then cash it at another financial institution.) Central Brooklyn was billed $3,000 a week to pay for a Boston-based consultant and would pay him more than $80,000. The branch building was hastily sold for $250,000, a price that was less than members hoped for. The transition from the branch building to Central Brooklyn's current location two blocks away, on Fulton Street between Bedford Avenue and Franklin Avenue, was handled so clumsily that many depositors were not notified and could not find it. The deficit, meanwhile, has risen above $500,000 under conservatorship.,''Frankly, the sinister interpretation is that they are deliberately bleeding the institution and making it more difficult to save,'' said Mr. Louis, 36, now a consultant who works with large corporations seeking to do business in the inner city. (One of his clients is The New York Times.) ''A less sinister interpretation, and probably more accurate, is that they are finding it very hard to run a banking institution in the inner city. Surprise, surprise.'',Norman D'Amours, chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, said conservatorship allowed Central Brooklyn to correct ''record-keeping errors,'' shrink itself to a more manageable size and, for the first time, register three consecutive profitable months. Mr. D'Amours called the consultant's fee ''an off-putting number,'' but he attributed the increased deficit to existing problems. He acknowledged that two larger credit unions outside the neighborhood would like to merge with Central Brooklyn but said, ''Our primary aim is to return the credit union to its members.'' Last week, the agency granted members an extension until March 23 to prepare their business plan.,But the agency is politically divided, and Central Brooklyn's members are concerned. The agency charters and regulates 7,900 Federal credit unions and insures their deposits, as well as the deposits of 4,200 state-chartered credit unions. Earlier this month, Mr. D'Amours, regarded as a friend to institutions like Central Brooklyn, told a House subcommittee that his agency should encourage the chartering of new small credit unions that serve low-income people.,But the two other board members, Yolanda Townsend Wheat and Dennis Dollar, testified that the agency's obligation is to protect its insurance fund by promoting the growth of large credit unions that are more stable. Such a 2-to-1 split could mean problems for Central Brooklyn.,''We have very serious concerns that N.C.U.A. has stepped up its campaign of merging these credit unions, particularly the smaller ones,'' said Mr. Rosenthal. At least two of the other small credit unions founded during the early 1990's have been taken over by other credit unions.,Central Brooklyn's members created a seven-member board earlier this month to carry out the new business plan. Mr. Louis and Mr. Griffith continue to play unofficial roles, but they are not board members, partly because of their tense relationship with regulators. D. Akilah Pannigan, a former I.B.M. employee and the new chairman, said the new board would run the institution very cautiously.,''We envision initially a creep-before-you-walk attitude that says, 'We're going to do this slowly, but we're going to do it right,' '' Ms. Pannigan said.,For Mr. Griffith, the return of the institution is critical. He vividly remembers the loans that failed, but also loans that helped an elderly woman pay for her husband's funeral or helped a homeless man get an apartment. He and Mr. Louis say they realize that they made mistakes, if well-intentioned ones.,''We served a lot of people who couldn't go anywhere else, but there is a price to pay for all those expectations,'' Mr. Griffith said. ''The bottom line is you can't do everything.''",JIM YARDLEY,"FEB. 28, 1999",Lender to Poor Lands in Trouble; High Hopes and Low Revenues Crippled Credit Union,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/lender-poor-lands-trouble-high-hopes-low-revenues-crippled-credit-union.html
"The name Cockburn's means port to many aficionados around the world.,But grape farmers in the ruggedly mountainous Douro River valley of Portugal still call the shipper Casa Smithes. To them it is irrelevant that John Henry Smithes, who died in England on Jan. 22 at the age of 88, retired 29 years ago as a director at Cockburn Smithes (pronounced CO-burn SMITH-eez), one of the world's major port houses.,An outdoorsman, Mr. Smithes immersed himself in grape-growing and wine-making and became one of the trade's most influential blenders. He shaped Cockburn's dryish, lean, elegant style, especially such perennial favorites as Fine Ruby and the flagship Special Reserve.,Mr. Smithes was equally renowned for ''elevating spitting to a high art,'' said Peter M. Cobb, a director. ''He had spittoons all over the place,'' Mr. Cobb said. ''He spat right into them from six feet away. The wine never hit the floor.'' For once, famously bad English teeth proved a boon. ''One thing John didn't have many of was teeth,'' Mr. Cobb said. So nothing ''got in the way'' of a wine's trajectory in the Cockburn's tasting room at Vila Nova de Gaia.,Friends and associates described Mr. Smithes as an unpretentious, hot-tempered, lovable eccentric. After private school, he joined the family business in Cockburn's London office in 1930. At a moment when dark suits, stiff collars and bowler hats defined proper business attire, he clung to a disreputable tweed jacket, brown brogues and a rakish slouch hat.,Such earthy irreverence better suited Oporto, Portugal, where he joined his father and became a partner in 1938. But World War II approached, and he and Nancy Smithes, to whom he would be married for 65 years, went home to England. Both joined the Royal Air Force.,As a pilot Mr. Smithes could not land his fighters flawlessly; he inflicted more damage on them than Nazi fire did. His superiors turned him into an observer and rear gunner. Back in Portugal in 1946, he proved unpilotlike, too, in his Fords.,If he did not master switchback roads, he knew almost every inch of every quinta, or estate, of the steeply terraced Douro region. He appreciated the characters and explored the commercial prospects of red grapes virtually unknown outside Portugal: touriga nacional, tinta roriz, tinta barroca, touriga francesa, tinta cao and mourisco.,Mr. Smithes started Cockburn's first experimental vineyard, at Tua, in 1933, with many clones of indigenous varieties. ''The experiments were not acted on for 30 years,'' Mr. Cobb said, ''because it took the trade 30 years to realize that it could not rely on independent growers to provide high-quality fruit.'' In 1975, five years after Mr. Smithes retired, Cockburn's started buying and planting acreage in a big way -- his way.,His signature broad-brimmed hat and red bandanna made him look like the archetypal Mexican bandit of 1940's B-movies.,Mr. Smithes, whose tasting abilities were the talk of the valley, defined and classified hundreds of separate lots of wine before blending them. He was brilliant at judging young ports and cask-aged ports, and in putting together the blends of ruby ports and old tawnies. But some thought he was less adept at producing vintage ports.,Although he ultimately took himself out of the Douro, he could not take the Douro out of himself. After retiring to south Devon, he bought and converted a property into a miniature quinta, with terraces, vines and a bay view. Twice a year he revisited Cockburn's (now owned by the Britain-based Allied Domecq Spirits and Wine): at harvest and in springtime, when the new wine had settled down.,Mr. Smithes once gave an old friend, David Lett, owner of the Eyrie Vineyards in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, a wooden port-holding canteen inscribed:,I must have one at 11,,'Tis a duty which must be done,,If I don't have one at 11,,I must have 11 at 1.,In Mr. Lett's view, ''It was the one at 11 that propelled John to 88 years.'' Above all other wine qualities, Mr. Smithes prized ''grip,'' a term that characterizes the length and quality of a port's finish, or aftertaste. His associates also interpreted it as the guiding principle of his life.",HOWARD G.

"IN a world in which juicy gossip is the ultimate commodity, Rabbi Gary Mazo is sitting on a gold mine. Rabbi Mazo leads M'kor Shalom, the huge Reform synagogue in Cherry Hill whose former rabbi and founder, Fred J. Neulander, stands accused of ordering the November 1994 murder of his wife.,At first, Carol Neulander's murder was thought to be random, and people felt the shock, fear and sorrow that occurs when tragedy strikes close. Then the story changed. Investigators found that Rabbi Neulander had been having an affair. His lover, it was said, had pressed him to leave his wife. Rabbi Neulander eventually became the prime suspect; he was indicted last month.,Rabbi Mazo, a soft-spoken man with boyish looks and an office strewn with toys, was a 30-year-old assistant rabbi when the murder took place. Within two days, homicide detectives showed up at his office. He had to appear before the grand jury that indicted Rabbi Neulander and will most likely be called as a witness at the trial.,And it has fallen to Rabbi Mazo to lead a 950-family congregation through a scandal of Biblical proportions. Even without a scandal, running a synagogue with as many as three bar and bat mitzvahs a weekend would be hard. But Rabbi Mazo has had to lead his congregation through shock, disbelief, revulsion, anger and shame.,''He didn't just have to lead, he had to carry it,'' one congregant, Cheryl Wallace, told me recently.,Most of all, Rabbi Mazo has had to deal with the infectious nature of gossip. What could be more riveting, after all, than the story of a fellow rabbi accused of shattering God's commandments. To draw his congregation back to the sacred, Rabbi Mazo has had to battle the seductiveness of the profane. He has done so by teaching about lashon hara, or ''evil talk.'',''In a nutshell, the principle is, if it's not about you and it doesn't concern you, it's not your business to share it,'' he explained.,Upholding this principle has not been particularly easy. Rumors about Rabbi Neulander's affair and his link to the murder had begun to swirl early on, but when his resignation was announced at a congregational meeting in February 1995, nothing had yet been substantiated.,Congregants who loved the older rabbi -- by all accounts, an unusually charismatic man -- could not believe he had done such things. Some were enraged, feeling he had been forced to step down unfairly. Rabbi Mazo and other synagogue leaders knew by then that the rumors about Rabbi Neulander's infidelity were true. Yet rather than confirm them, they withstood the congregation's anger.,Since then, Rabbi Mazo has toed the line between helpful dialogue and gossip. In the early months, he brought in social workers and therapists. He has kept up E-mail correspondence with students away at college, whose faith in Judaism was shattered by the affair. He has delivered sermons on the shattering of one's faith.,But whatever Rabbi Mazo may know about Carol Neulander's murder, he will not say -- except as required by law. Whatever rewards our scandal-obsessed society gives for telling all -- television exposure, movie deals or just the breathless thrill of spreading ''dish'' -- Rabbi Mazo has resisted.,What he will talk about is how M'kor Shalom has survived by maintaining its dignity, through avoiding lashon hara. He likes to explain it through a piece of rabbinic folklore, which was retold by the synagogue's president, Steven Burkett.,A man in the shtetl had been spreading stories about another man. He felt awful about it, and went to the rabbi, who said: ''Go home, cut open your pillow, take out all the feathers and place one in front of every house.'' The man followed the rabbi's advice but nothing happened, so he returned the next day. ''Tonight,'' the rabbi commanded, ''go back and collect all those feathers.'',''Once you slander a person, you hurt their character,'' Mr. Burkett says. ''There's really no way to put it back in the box.'',Mr. Burkett is proud of M'kor Shalom's accomplishments since the scandal erupted. Not only has the synagogue survived the indictment of its founder, he says, it has thrived -- and remembered its mission. On the night of the emotional meeting when Rabbi Neulander's resignation was announced in February 1995, the news media showed up and filmed people leaving. In the background, Mr. Burkett says, you could see people bringing in trays of food for 12 homeless men arriving for temporary shelter -- just as planned.,Rabbi Mazo will be leaving M'kor Shalom in July to lead a temple in Cape Cod. He says he has always wanted to lead a smaller flock. He feels that he has done what he can do for M'kor Shalom, and that the final healing will take place after he has gone.,''The Chinese character for 'crisis' is a combination of the symbols for 'danger' and 'opportunity,' '' Rabbi Mazo says. ''Not every community takes advantage of the opportunity in crisis. This congregation did.''",DEBRA GALANT,"FEB. 28, 1999","JERSEY; The Shame, and the Pride, in Cherry Hill",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/jersey-the-shame-and-the-pride-in-cherry-hill.html

"YOU don't have to be Italian-American to relate to this play,'' said the producer Lee Pope before last Saturday night's opening performance of ''The Gathering'' at the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls, N.Y.,Both Ms. Pope's words and the play by Steve Scionti and James Shanta are the epitome of a ''cliche coming true,'' as a lyric by Oscar Hammerstein 2d goes. It is almost as if Mr. Scionti, the play's solo performer, who was born and raised in Middletown, is a champion of truth in stereotype.,Look to Mr. Scionti's grandfather Angelo Morello's credo: ''You take the good; no matter how bad, everybody has a good. Let's go eat.'',On stage, Mr. Scionti's family gathering is taking place after Angelo Morello's funeral, with the actor leaping back and forth through time, playing eight roles, including his dying grandfather, who was a shoemaker; his own brother, Antonio, five years younger and their father, Sebastiano, a mason and a welder. Among others, count Jerry, the pizza maker; Amadeus, his mother's youngest brother, the one with the white shoes and the big mouth; Manny, his father's brother who had two passions (women and food) and Brother Connely, teacher of sex education -- or ''sexual responsibility'' -- at Xavier High School in Middletown. The girls went to Mercy High -- Xavier's sister school.,Mr. Scionti also tells of his Mama Rosa going into a ''Sicilian tirade of degradation'' at the sight of a Progresso can when she wants Tuttorossa tomatoes for the marinara sauce. ''What do you think we are,'' she asks while she prepares the eggplant casserole, ''Neapolitans?'',In the meantime, grandfather Morello's wife, Josephina, having lost her voice to throat cancer, won't go downstairs, so everyone has to shout upstairs. Mr. Scionti evokes the color and the dynamics of a family's role in his own coming of age.,Angelo Morello (1915 to 1990) migrated in 1955 from Sicily to Middletown, when Mr. Scionti was 10. A bandleader -- yes, he led a marching band and there was a fund-raising parade for St. Sebastian's Church in the Italian village -- Mr. Morelli became disillusioned when he joined a copy of St. Sebastian's in Middletown, comparing membership in the house of prayer with ticket buying in a club of V.I.P.'s.,In 1991, Mr. Scionti's parents left Middletown to retire to West Palm Beach, Fla., where his mother attends church and his father works for a synagogue. Many of Mr. Scionti's family members who live in Middletown filled the Schoolhouse on Saturday. High school friends, too. Everyone knew everyone.,''Hey, Joe,'' ''Hiya, Tony,'' ''John is there two seats over there?'' ''Sit down'' and ''Shh-Shh'' were heard throughout the 110-seat theater before the performance began. ''Mom,'' a young woman shouted across five rows. People in the front waved to others in the back. ''He doesn't talk about us,'' said one disappointed teen-age girl with some advance word about the play.,There were Aunt Joyce and Aunt Adele and Uncle Carmello -- and all their children and their dates. The Schoolhouse was just the place for a gathering -- and no one had died.,While it is hardly likely that ''The Gathering'' will go on playing to such an in group, with squeals of delight greeting every recognizable on-stage name, the play's message is lovely. Angelo Morello paid for Mr. Scionti's first dance lesson, and the agile 35-year-old actor re-creates his evolution as a dancer -- and his identity through dance -- from the age of 8 (dancing a contadina) to his mid-20's (during the disco craze, when he impersonates Tony Manero, the lead character in ''Saturday Night Fever'').,The athletic Mr. Scionti was taunted in Middletown for taking classical dance classes. Ballet meant giving up baseball. He wanted to be in the high school musical, but he also wanted ''to be normal like everybody else.'',It took the encouragement -- no, the inspiration -- of Angelo Morello who spoke of the importance of people ''going where their hearts take them up to the sky -- up there with Rossini,'' he said.,''Michelangelo painted the chapel for people to look up.'' he added.,Angelo Morello was discouraged by his own father, who was a shoemaker. ''I shoe-make. You shoe-make,'' his father had said. But Angelo said life-changing words to his grandson Steve: ''Your father make you like you.'' It was then that Steve Scionti quit the baseball team for the bottle dance in ''Fiddler on the Roof'' at Xavier High.,No, you don't have to be Italian-American to relate to ''The Gathering'' even though Mr. Scionti makes you think you are. By the time the tale of Angelo Morello has been told, you know that flights of angels truly sang him to his rest.,''The Gathering,'' the Schoolhouse, 1 Owens Road, Croton Falls, N.Y. (914) 277-8477.

"THE International Monetary Fund is often described these days as the rapid-response team for global financial crises, monitoring the financial health of 182 nations and flying teams of economists off to nurse stricken countries back to health before contagion spreads.,Just don't try calling the doctors on a weekend.,Four blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the fund's headquarters, the White House Situation Room hums 24 hours a day. So do the State Department's Operations Center and the Treasury's lesser-known Watch Office.,But 20 months into a worldwide financial crisis that churns round the clock, the I.M.F. still closes down on nights and weekends. Last year, one senior official of the fund recalled, ''we had a desperate-sounding finance minister call in,'' seeking advice on a currency devaluation that might have shaken markets around the world. He reportedly had a pleasant chat with the security guard.,The story is worth remembering amid the grand political pronouncements -- here, in Europe and in Asia -- about the need to build a ''new global financial architecture.'' The rhetoric has its appeal: Most everyone agrees that the system for governing the world economy that emerged from a hotel ballroom in Bretton Woods, N.H., a half-century ago -- in the era of the gold standard and fixed exchange rates -- is hopelessly outdated.,But there the agreement ends. Some say that what the world financial system needs is not a new design but better wiring, in the form of greater communication among investors, regulators, governments and international oversight agencies -- if not security guards with Ph.D.'s in international economics.,Over the last few months, a plethora of small-bore fixes have been proposed, everything from ''exit taxes'' to make investors think twice about bailing out of troubled markets to ''early warning systems'' to make them think twice about the stability of the countries where they invest.,Then there are far grander designs -- so many, in fact, that it might be possible to build another ballroom at the old Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods out of bound reports describing what a new financial system should look like.,In the last two months alone, the World Bank, the I.M.F. and the United Nations have all published analyses of what's gone wrong in global finance, each coming to different conclusions about responsibility for the continuing crisis.,The Council on Foreign Relations, the private public-policy group based New York, has put together a high-powered commission to propose an overhaul of the system. Its report will jockey for shelf space with similar proposals oozing out of a dozen other prominent research centers.,The Group of Seven industrialized nations couldn't wait for the council, so last weekend it announced the creation of a ''Financial Stability Forum'' to help bring order to the chaos. The idea is to begin to connect the wiring, providing a place for market regulators in many countries and the myriad international regulatory groups to talk about setting common standards for dealing with financial concerns.,To keep the forum ''manageable,'' a G-7 statement explained, dozens of officials from each of the seven nations will be joined by no more than three members each from the I.M.F., the IBRD, the BIS and the OECD. Then, of course, ''the international regulatory groupings (BCBS, IOSCO, IAIS) would be represented by two members each, and the CGFS and CPSS by one each.'',(Readers interested in testing their knowledge of international organizations will find the acronyms decoded at the end of this article.),The forum's first meeting is scheduled for next month.,What will change? The betting these days is not much. While some modest changes are already under way -- mostly tougher disclosure requirements for countries and their central banks -- a broad remaking of the system seems unlikely. President Clinton, who during the market swoon in September described the ''new architecture'' drive as a top priority of his second term, has spoken about it publicly only intermittently since December. And while the Treasury Department says long-term solutions will be the focus of the annual summit of G-7 leaders in early summer, skeptics abound.,''Crises are endemic to our system, and sometimes they are healthy,'' Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank's  Asian operations said recently. ''But after every one, there is always talk about rebuilding the system, until the markets get better. Then people forget about it. I suspect the same will happen this time.'',For now, though, here are the hottest ideas under discussion -- and the problems that plague them.,Tsunami Alerts,Imagine a Weather Channel for the global economy, a proposal being pushed by many European nations. If financial quakes loomed -- a devaluation in Brazil, export declines in China, more capital flight from South Africa or Indonesia -- the I.M.F. would broadcast the news. (It is already broadcasting summaries of its periodic reviews of member countries, with much of the information posted on its World Wide Web site, www.imf.org.) Sounds great: Tune in, then call your broker.,But there's a hitch. Weather satellites can pick up an approaching storm a lot better than experts can see a financial disaster ahead. There were plenty of warnings about Thailand in 1997, for example, but almost no one predicted a calamity.,''Nothing in my 26 years on Wall Street or my six years in government suggests that there is any predictive capability even remotely reliable enough for such a system,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said recently.,The I.M.F. notes that it often detects signs that a crisis is brewing, only to discover later that the crisis never arrives. ''We've successfully predicted 14 of the past 6 financial crises,'' joked Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official.,Of course, when an alarm issued by the Weather Channel turns out to be false, everyone is relieved. But an alarm from the I.M.F. could easily set off a stampede of investors -- creating exactly the kind of panic everyone is trying to avoid.,Tollbooths on the Highway,The experts call them ''capital controls'' -- limits, or taxes, on short-term investment money that flows in or out of small nations.,The appeal is simple: If investors know that that their money will be tied up in Malaysia or Mozambique for some time, or that it will cost them a few percentage points to get it out early, they will think twice about rushing ''hot money'' into an economy that could be destabilized by a sudden, huge outflow of cash.,Not surprisingly, politicians love this idea. And everyone points to Chile, which taxed short-term capital until recently, when investment dried up for all emerging markets.,And there's the rub. As Malaysia learned when it banned trading in its currency, capital controls are a great way to regain sovereignty over an economy. But after a while, investors begin thinking about putting their money elsewhere -- in countries that don't tax capital.,In short, the country that sets up a tollbooth can expect to see fewer and fewer cars on the highway. And that means the country could go begging for foreign investment. Or it might use the existence of the tax as an excuse not to change its economy.,Promises, Promises,One lesson of the last two years is that bad things can happen to good economies.,South Korea, for example, clearly has the talent and the means to rank among the world's best economies. But when it nearly ran out of central bank reserves in 1997, investors panicked and the currency melted down.,To avert such panics, the I.M.F. and some economists have suggested that countries could be ''prequalified'' for emergency aid, in the hope that the mere existence of a big credit line would reassure investors. It would be a little like getting one of those letters from a credit card company offering a $10,000 credit line -- just in case you come up short one month on the mortgage.,That was essentially the deal the I.M.F. and the Treasury offered to Brazil last year, when it described a $41 billion bailout as ''precautionary.'' Unfortunately, that package failed to prevent a run on the currency, the real, illustrating one of the shortcomings of such aid.,Brazil received the aid in return for detailed promises to tighten its belt, and fast. But once the deal was announced, the Brazilian Congress concluded that the heat was off and there was no rush about the reforms. It took investors only two months, until January, to conclude that the reforms might be vapor, at which point they fled.,What can the I.M.F. do if a country fails to deliver on its promises?,In an extreme case, as in Russia, it can stop lending altogether. But un-qualifying a country is essentially an invitation for the world to pull its money out, creating the crisis the aid was intended to avoid.,Aim at That Target,The Germans, with some support from France and Japan, want an agreement to establish ''target zones'' that would reduce the volatility of the world's three major currencies: the dollar, the euro and the yen. Under this plan, the major economies would coordinate their policies to keep their currencies within a specified trading range.,Mr. Rubin thinks this is one of the worst ideas he has ever heard.,Europe's enthusiasm for managing currencies is understandable. Its leaders want to make sure the United States doesn't let the value of the dollar slip in order to make American exports, which are declining sharply, more competitive against European products.,Washington, of course, does not want a committee of the Group of Seven dictating American monetary policy. Suppose the United States economy began sinking, and the value of the dollar sank with it. The Group of Seven might mandate that the United States raise interest rates to stabilize the currency. That could worsen the economic downturn.,Smaller economies also have a dog in this fight. Remember, Thailand got in trouble because it tied its currency, the baht, to the dollar. As the value of the dollar rose, so did the value of the baht, until it quickly became unsustainably high. And when Thailand de-linked its currency from the dollar -- well, that was the day the Asian crisis started.,Start Bailing,When a country begins to list, investors bail out. So beginning with the effort to save South Korea, the Treasury has talked about ''bailing in'' investors.,What American officials mean is that big banks and other lenders should be compelled to take responsibility for having provided countries with the money they used so foolishly. For example, the lenders might be obliged to roll over their loans or turn short-term lending into long-term lending, rather than head for the exits. When South Korea was teetering, Mr. Rubin strong-armed some lenders to do just that.,But since then, the enthusiasm for ''bailing in'' has been tempered by reality. Bankers have begun to warn that if the risk of lending to emerging markets climbs too high, either they will charge the riskiest countries the highest interest rates (to compensate for the possibility that they will one day be ''bailed in'') or they will avoid them completely. A result is that the developing world may not develop very fast.,Swinging a Baton,Barry Eichengreen, an international economist at the University of California at Berkeley, says the I.M.F. ''will have to become less of a fireman and more of a policeman.'',In a new book, ''Toward a New International Financial Architecture'' (Institute for International Economics, 1999), he explained that rather than roaring to the rescue once disaster strikes, the fund should be constantly policing compliance with international rules and regulations -- and making sure that the markets understand who is abiding by the rules and who is not.,But that would require a change of culture at the I.M.F., which has often been beholden to its members, including the rule breakers. Fund officials would have to be willing to utter unpleasant news, in strong terms.,And they might need to answer their phones on the weekends.,The acronyms: IBRD International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, better known as the World Bank; BIS Bank for International Settlements; OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; BCBS Basle Committee on Banking Supervision; IOSCO International Organization of Securities Commissions; IAIS International Association of Insurance Supervisors; CGFS Committee on the Global Financial System; CPSS Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems.",DAVID E.

"HE is Long Island's champion political escape artist, the Houdini of Mineola. But as he struggles with a huge budget deficit, a health insurance scandal and a drumbeat of reported abuses at the county jail, the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, faces his greatest challenge ever, maybe even a career breaker.,In his 12-year tenure, Mr. Gulotta has survived setbacks and rebounded to score even bigger election triumphs than before. Now some politicians say his luck may be running out.,''I think Tom realizes he's living on borrowed time as well as on borrowed money,'' said one public official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, who has talked with Mr. Gulotta and the chairman of Nassau's Republican Party machine, Joseph N. Mondello.,Mr. Mondello has made little secret of his exasperation at the mounting difficulties and has even revived talk that he might engineer Mr. Gulotta's resignation and, by appointment of the County Legislature, take over the county executive's job himself for awhile to straighten out the mess. No one expects such a drastic step any time soon, however.,Instead, Mr. Mondello is first trying to get top county officials to solve the problems themselves. To that end, earlier this month he summoned Mr. Gulotta, Comptroller Frederick Parola and the County Legislature's presiding officer, Bruce A. Blakeman, to a meeting at party headquarters in Westbury.,Though relations among the four men have been rocky, for now they seem to be trying to harmonize for G.O.P. self-preservation.,Mr. Gulotta has been grappling with the largest deficit in Nassau's history, officially estimated at $160 million to $190 million for 1998. The deficit projection for 1999 is $125 million, which would be the second biggest deficit, and bond-rating agencies have put the county on notice that its credit-worthiness may be downgraded.,Mr. Gulotta is also saddled with a scandal over the transfer of the county's health insurance to Benefit Plan Administrators. The contract was supposed to save up to $15 million, but instead raised the county's costs by as much as $50 million.,The red ink and sloppy supervision of the contract are damaging enough, but it's the smell emanating from the deal that may hurt the Republicans most. Mr. Gulotta's chief deputy, Robert J. McDonald, helped arrange the contract, then retired and began collecting a $150,000 annual fee from William M. Blake, the former Suffolk County Republican Party chairman and head of the brokerage that underwrote the deal.,And then there is the Federal investigation into charges of abusive guards at the Nassau County jail, a case prompted by an inmate's brutal homicide there. Sheriff Joseph Jablonksy, who runs the jail, is Mr. Gulotta's appointee.,These successive setbacks are hardly the way Mr. Gulotta hoped to celebrate Nassau County's 100th anniversary this year.,''This is a defining moment for those of us in county government,'' Mr. Blakeman said. ''This is an opportunity for Tom to show that he has the leadership skills to solve tough problems.'',Mr. Gulotta has begun to tackle the issues, ending the insurance contract and announcing a series of revenue-raising moves. But Mr. Blakeman has also grown increasingly assertive on behalf of a usually docile Legislature, issuing investigative subpoenas, calling the county budget director's testimony ''a disgrace'' and accusing Mr. McDonald of a conflict of interest.,Republican leaders are clearly nervous, not just about Mr. Gulotta and his future, but about the rest of the party. They fear repercussions for their ticket in this fall's off-year elections. All 19 seats in the Legislature are up, as well as 27 local offices in the towns of Hempstead, North Hempstead and Oyster Bay and the cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach. Republicans control the Legislature by a lopsided majority, 14 seats for them and 5 for the Democrats.,The back-to-back 1998-99 deficits could not come at a worse time for the Republican legislators. They may be forced to impose tax increases or program cuts or both in adopting the next budget -- a vote that by law must come just before the election.,Although he is not running this year, Mr. Gulotta's record will surely be a focal campaign issue. If he proves to be a major liability, he may have the most to lose.,''If the Republicans reach the point of it being either him or them, then something's going to happen,'' said Arthur J. Kremer, a former Democratic state assemblyman from Long Beach. ''If the county gets downgraded to junk-bond level, Gulotta's not invincible.'',Lewis J. Yevoli, the former Democratic supervisor of Oyster Bay, who lost to Mr. Gulotta for county executive in 1997, said: ''I don't think he survives this time. He's got nine lives, but I think he's into his ninth life.'',Despite Mr. Gulotta's woes, most politicians contend that it would be a big mistake to write him off so soon.,''I've been on standby half a dozen times for the political wake of Tom Gulotta, and it hasn't happened yet, so don't ever count this guy out,'' said Bruce Nyman, the Legislature's minority leader. Comptroller Parola said: ''I would never underestimate him. We're obviously going to have a deficit, but there is time to deal with it.'',Mr. Gulotta actually has plenty going for him. For starters, Nassau has no impeachment or recall process to remove him, and he has nearly three years left in his term.,''That's several lifetimes in politics,'' said the former Suffolk County Executive, John V. N. Klein, a Republican. The public's attention span can be short, and there is time for yet another reversal of fortune. Just a year ago, for example, Mr. Gulotta was still savoring his crushing 2-to-1 landslide over Mr. Yevoli and was being discussed as a contender for statewide office.,''Not to minimize them, I think there's a tendency to overestimate the impact of these issues,'' Mr. Klein said. He predicted that Mr. Gulotta will survive if county officials make ''the painful but absolutely essential'' decisions and ''face up to the fact there may have to be some modest increases in property taxes coupled with some serious spending cuts.'',A vigorous 54 years old, Mr. Gulotta is nowhere near voluntary retirement. ''Never felt better,'' he said in an interview while he was drafting his annual state of the county message, delivered on Monday. He remains unruffled, at least in public, and rarely if ever strays from his own carefully memorized script.,''A little over a year ago the voters elected me with one of the highest pluralities in the history of Nassau County,'' he said, ''and I intend to justify the confidence they placed in me.'',Undefeated in decades of running for the State Assembly, Hempstead supervisor, presiding supervisor and county executive, Mr. Gulotta is widely reported to retain high polling numbers, although some political insiders question the depth of his support.,Any potential challenger must confront Mr. Gulotta's daunting personal campaign fund of $2 million and the corps of loyal followers he commands within the Republican organization.,And the rest of the picture in Nassau is just about ideal for Mr. Gulotta. Crime is at its lowest level in 29 years, welfare rolls for home relief are down 53 percent from their high, and the 2.2 percent jobless rate is the smallest in a quarter of a century.,But for most of this decade, finance has been Mr. Gulotta's nemesis. The problem started in 1992, during the double whammy of the national recession and the demise of the aerospace industry, once the mainstay of the Island's economy. The county ran up a $120 million deficit, the largest up to that time. His proposed remedy was to increase property taxes by nearly 26 percent.,But Mr. Mondello -- then serving as the Town of Hempstead supervisor as well as party chairman -- led a rare revolt against the executive, slashing the tax increase to about 10 percent and leaving Mr. Gulotta the thankless duty of cutting programs and some 2,000 jobs.,Mr. Gulotta came up for re-election the next year and faced a spirited challenge from the Democratic nominee, Benjamin L. Zwirn, then supervisor of North Hempstead. Mr. Gulotta won with 51 percent of the vote, which has turned out to be his closest call ever at the polls, and he vowed never again to allow himself to be tagged as a tax-raising candidate.,He embarked on a strategy of routinely overestimating revenues and underestimating expenses. He imposed room and board fees on jail prisoners and projected $8 million in revenue. Most prisoners could not pay, of course, so only a small fraction was collected. He also banked on one-shot revenues that failed to materialize, like the 144-acre tract in Plainview that he counted as sold in eight budget proposals.,Creative budgeting also concocted deals like getting the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to advance Nassau $51 million for a year in return for the county borrowing $102 million in long-term bonds to finance transit projects in later years.,The flourishing economy and good luck enabled Mr. Gulotta to scrape by with two small surpluses and three relatively modest deficits, until last year -- when hardly anything went right.,Critics say Mr. Gulotta has no one to blame but himself. All along the way, he was warned about the dangers of his daring budget maneuvers by the state and county comptrollers, legislators and the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee, among others.,''It takes a special talent to mismanage to this degree,'' said Phoebe Goodman, director of the Citizens Budget Committee.,Defending his deficits last week, Mr. Gulotta said: ''I make no apologies for cutting and freezing Nassau County's property taxes for seven consecutive years.'',But his critics say Nassau would have no financial problem if Mr. Gulotta had taken as much care with its budget as he did with his campaign fund. Ms. Goodman suggested, ''Maybe he'd like to make a contribution to the county general fund.'',Whatever sympathy Mr. Gulotta may have evoked in 1992-3 because of national and local economic pressures beyond his control, few people seem to feel sorry for him now.,''The economy is booming and the state, the city and everybody else -- even the Federal government -- are all in the black, and here one of the richest counties in the nation is in the hole to the tune of $200 million,'' said Desmond Ryan, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers group.,Mr. Gulotta downplays the deficit. ''Is this a legitimate issue that must be dealt with? Absolutely,'' he said. ''Is this a dire circumstance? Absolutely not.'' But the Legislature's budget review director, Tim Sullivan, described the county's plight with precisely that word, ''dire.'',To replenish the county's coffers, Mr. Gulotta recently reached a long-delayed agreement to sell the county medical center to a public benefit agency for $70 million, though the county will have to pay the agency a total of $127 million over 25 years, including $18 million for each of the first five years. He sued the health insurance company, and it agreed to settle for $16 million. He also announced an agreement to sell those 144 acres in Plainview for $23 million.,In his state of the county address on Monday, Mr. Gulotta repeatedly boasted of ''cutting and freezing taxes.'' He said that Legislator Blakeman, Comtproller Parola and he ''are forging a long-term fiscal plan that is designed to reduce short- and long-term county obligations, cut taxpayer spending and reduce reliance upon non-recurring revenues.'',Critics accuse Mr. Gulotta of failing to address the underlying fiscal issues. Nassau now has nearly $3 billion in debt, or $2,214 per resident. That is more than triple the $687 figure in neighboring Suffolk.,Nassau's antiquated assessment system, based on 1938 construction prices, prompts thousands of challenges from property owners every year. The county pays more than a $100 million a year in refunds for excess taxes, and in recent years has incurred $1 billion of debt for this problem alone.,Pay for a typical Nassau police officer will reach $73,859 next year, compared to $70,659 in Suffolk and $49,023 in New York City. Other personnel costs are also high. Nassau Community College professors are among the highest paid in the nation, even compared with some Ivy League schools. Civil service workers just negotiated a 20 percent increase over five years, well above current inflation rates.,If Mr. Gulotta finishes his term at the end of 2001, he would tie the longevity record set half a century ago by J. Russell Sprague. But sentiment is growing in Republican ranks that it is time for Mr. Gulotta to move on. The question is, where can he go?,''Joe Mondello would not be unhappy if Tom wanted to leave,'' said Mr. Nyman, ''but he's not going anywhere. What's he going to do, become a lawyer and do closings?'',Although his late father was a judge and his brother is one, Mr. Gulotta has turned down past suggestions that he accept a judgeship. The most coveted appointments, on the Federal bench with their lifetime tenure, are foreclosed to him for now because both of New York's United States Senators, who sponsor the nominations, are Democrats since Charles Schumer upset Alfonse M. D'Amato last fall.,With the White House in Democratic hands for at least two more years, any other Federal post is equally unlikely. One possibility that has been discussed, however, is an appointment to a state post. If Governor Pataki saw a way to help Nassau Republicans by taking Mr. Gulotta off their hands, he would probably be glad to oblige.,One factor favoring Mr. Gulotta's continued reign is that while there are several potential successors, none is the clear-cut heir apparent.,To become county executive, Mr. Mondello would have to decide whether to relinquish his party post and private job. Legislator Blakeman had been a front-runner before suffering a setback in running last year for State Comptroller, but the current crisis is giving him a new opportunity to show leadership.,Supervisor Richard V. Guardino Jr. of Hempstead, Nassau's largest town and the Republican home base, would be a natural contender. But he has been in his job barely a year. His predecessor, Gregory P. Peterson, seems content to continue as president of the Off-Track Betting agency. State Senator Michael L. Balboni and Supervisor John Venditto of Oyster Bay are relatively new. Comptroller Parola is a veteran elected county official, but years ago he made the mistake of challenging Mr. Mondello, though they have since made up.,As for the Democrats, they are a distinct minority in Nassau, and the current disarray in their party handicaps their chances of capitalizing on Mr. Gulotta's difficulties. But Mr. Nyman said that they intend to make serious inroads in November.,More than anything else, however, Mr. Gulotta's fate hinges on what he and the other officials do in the coming months.,''If the problems get solved in a credible way, there will be one outcome, and if they don't, there'll be another outcome,'' said Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant who grew up in Nassau and who helped run Mr. Schumer's Senate campaign.,Ms. Goodman agreed, but only if Mr. Gulotta takes some bitter fiscal medicine. ''I think he'll survive,'' she said, ''if he does the right thing.''",BRUCE LAMBERT,"FEB. 28, 1999",Is Gulotta Living His Ninth Life?,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/is-gulotta-living-his-ninth-life.html
"IN his sun-filled Manhattan office overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral, John D. Chadwick keeps a model 1955 Oldsmobile, a smaller version of the car in his garage. ''In high school, I dated a girl whose father had one, and I've always wanted one,'' said Mr. Chadwick, now 59. Did he get the girl? ''No,'' he said with a laugh. ''She tried to pawn me off on her kid sister.'',Mr. Chadwick has had plenty of time to get over the girl from high school. And today, the aging of America's population is one of three themes in Mr. Chadwick's investing. He runs the $7 billion large-capitalization portfolio of Bessemer Trust, which manages a total of $23.2 billion for institutions and wealthy individuals, as well as Old Westbury Core Equities, a fund begun last year.,''Clearly, that leads you to health care, but there's more than one way to look at aging,'' he said. For example, in both portfolios Mr. Chadwick owns less obvious plays like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which helps people save for retirement.,''We build the portfolio around long-term themes where we see above-average growth on a worldwide basis, and then pick the companies that are most advantaged from that,'' Mr. Chadwick said.,A second theme is the Internet.  ''We want to own companies tied to the Internet, companies which are making money,'' he said. ''But right now, the profit on the Internet is gained from building the system, not from building Web sites.'' So his portfolio also includes Cisco Systems, Intel and MCI Worldcom.,His third theme is America's bargain shopping binge. ''There's a mentality in the country now that you can buy anything you like at the lowest price,'' he said. His retail stock holdings include Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depot and Costco.,Since he joined Bessemer in April 1994, Mr. Chadwick's theme-playing has been sweet music to investors' ears: The large-cap portfolio returned 24.6 percent, annualized, for the five-year period ended Dec. 31,  versus 23.1 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.,In February 1998, with the start of the Old Westbury fund, Mr. Chadwick began managing for the masses. It has returned 24.1 percent through Feb. 19, versus 19.7 percent for the S.& P. and 26.7 percent for the average large-cap growth fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.,Mr. Chadwick uses an old tenet of growth-oriented investing: Rising earnings are the basis of rising equity prices. He wants 60 percent of either portfolio to produce consistent annual earnings growth of 15 to 20 percent during the next five years.,He does not expect the remaining 40 percent, comprised of ''opportunistic'' stocks, to match that consistency, since it is peppered with the stocks of technology companies and those undergoing reorganization.,Mr. Chadwick is not a growth-at-any-price investor. When he worries about market valuations, as he does now, he stops buying stocks. But he doesn't just raise his cash holdings.,Instead, Mr. Chadwick hedges the portfolios. In early February, he bought put options that give him the right to sell the S.&. P 500 index at then-current levels, and sold other put options which give their holder the right to sell the index at a price about 20 percent below that level. Mr. Chadwick figures this will protect his portfolio if the market falls by up to 20 percent, but still let him profit if the market rises.,Mr. Chadwick has no target sell prices and is willing to hold high-priced stocks as long as his earnings criteria are met. The two virtually identical portfolios' price-to-earnings multiple is 45, based on expected 1999 earnings, with expected earnings growth of 23.3 percent.,ONE of his favorite holdings is EMC, which makes computer data storage equipment. He sees it as an Internet play -- but one with earnings -- because many Web sites use lots of data that need to be stored and because demand for full-motion Internet video will grow.,Mr. Chadwick first bought EMC  shares in January 1997 at $18.85; they closed on Friday at $102.375, or 51 times his estimate of 1999 earnings. He puts EMC's three-year earnings growth rate at 35 percent a year.,Mr. Chadwick also likes Kohl's, a Midwest retailer of moderately priced clothing. ''Kohl's is working its way east,'' he said. It is opening 40 to 45 new stores this year, which amounts to square-footage growth of close to 20 percent , he said.,He first bought shares in February 1997, at $21.91. Mr. Chadwick expects a three-year earnings growth rate of 28 percent a year. The stock closed on Friday at $69, or 48 times his earnings estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2000.,One demographics play is the Carnival Corporation, the cruise-ship operator. ''Cruise ships offer convenience travel,'' he said. ''When people get older, they prefer stowing their luggage in one place to dragging it around as they travel from place to place. It's also easier to sign up for a cruise than to plan your own vacation, rent a car and make all your air and train connections.'',Last year, Carnival bought Cunard Lines, and Mr. Chadwick said it would increase its capacity 12 to 14 percent in 1999 by adding more ships.  The cruise industry raised prices by an average of 7 percent in 1998, and Mr. Chadwick said he expects increases of 2 percent in 1999.,He bought shares in August 1997 at $22.46; they closed at $44.50 on Friday, 27 times his 1999 earnings-per-share estimate of $1.64. He expects annual earnings growth of 20 percent in the next three years.",CAROLE GOULD,"FEB. 28, 1999",INVESTING WITH: John D.

"WITH the turbulence in aviation -- from a job action at American Airlines earlier this month to the disclosure last week that the Boeing Company may shut down some product lines -- this may seem an unlikely time to scan the blue yonder for buys. But some analysts and money managers say there are bargains in the stocks of a misunderstood industry called aviation services.,The sector, which includes businesses from parts manufacturing to maintenance and pilot training, stands to benefit from two trends: consolidation and increased demand for its services. Dozens of relatively small companies in this group merged last year, and more deals are likely. And as the average age of airplanes in the United States has risen, from 12.7 years to 15.8 years over the past decade, and as planes fly more miles, airlines may require more work on maintenance, repairs and overhauls.,Companies like Aviation Sales Inc., the AAR Corporation and Triumph Group are benefiting as the  airlines increasingly look outside for those services. North American carriers spent about $5.4 billion last year on maintenance, about two-thirds of it in-house, said Phil Dodge, an analyst at Southeast Research Partners, a brokerage firm in Boca Raton, Fla. He predicts that outsourcing will double by 2005.,So why are many stocks in this industry trading near their 52-week lows? Typically, aviation services shares have tracked those of Boeing, which has been hemorrhaging orders and jobs and which closed Friday at $35.625, down from its 52-week high of $56.25 last April.,The tracking pattern doesn't make much sense, analysts said. ''The towel has been thrown in big-time on this sector,'' said Bob D'Aleliohe, co-manager of the Neuberger Berman Genesis fund, which owns 8 percent of AAR.''The tremendous irony in all of this could be that because of Boeing's problems, there could be more opportunities for these companies,'' as fewer new planes are shipped, Mr. Dodge added.,The stock of Triumph has also been hurt, even though sales to Boeing will account for just 16 or 17 percent of revenues in its fiscal year ending in March. The shares hit a 52-week low of $24 in mid-December and closed on Friday at $25.625, less than 10 times analysts' consensus estimates for 1999 earnings. ''It's really an overreaction,'' said Mr. Dodge, who expects a price of $40 by the end of the year.,The stock of AAR fell sharply in early February, after the company advised analysts to lower earnings expectations because of difficulties with two acquisitions. AAR has not gained much ground since and closed on Friday at $15.125, slightly  above its 52-week low of $14.625 and 10.2 times analysts' estimate of this year's earnings. Still, Chris Mecray, an analyst at BT Alex Brown, said that the earnings warning was only moderately bad news and that revenues from airlines should keep growing.,Mr. Dodge expects the stock to hit $27 by year-end. ''I also see it as a potential acquisition,'' said Andy Knuth of Westport Asset Management, which owns almost 8 percent of AAR.,An exception in this group of sputtering stocks has been Aviation Sales. It closed at $45.3125 on Friday, just below its 52-week high of $47.50 on Feb. 1. On Feb. 18, the company reported a huge increase in earnings, to $25.5 million in 1998 from $4.8 million in 1997, a result of several acquisitions. Still, the stock trades at just 16.1 times analysts' estimates of earnings for this year. Mr. Mecray said he expects it to hit $54 in the next six to 12 months.",MICHELLE LEDER,"FEB. 28, 1999","INVESTING; In Aviation, the Bargains May Be in the Hangars",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/investing-in-aviation-the-bargains-may-be-in-the-hangars.html
"What does the mutual fund industry need? Emboldened and more effective fund directors, says Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who hosted a conference in Washington last week on the topic.,But Robert C. Pozen, chief executive of Fidelity Management and Research, the fund company, had his own suggestion at the conference's first panel discussion: A clampdown on hedge funds, the largely unregulated investment partnerships that manage more than $200 billion that might otherwise be invested with companies like Fidelity. The lack of Federal hedge fund oversight is a ''total abdication,'' Mr. Pozen said, costing Fidelity and other fund families precious stockpicking talent that has opted to go to hedge funds, with their bigger paychecks.,Make no mistake, he added, this is a class issue. Middle-class investors are being harmed because many of the sharpest managers forgo mutual funds -- which are open to any investor -- to run hedge funds that are open only to the wealthy.,Fidelity, famously, has lost several managers in the last few years to hedge funds, including Jeffrey N. Vinik, the former manager of the Magellan fund, John Hurley, the former manager of the Emerging Growth fund, and others.,The Pozen solution? The S.E.C. should require hedge funds to disclose their holdings twice a year, create a strict code of ethics for hedge fund managers and require ''symmetrical'' performance fees so that, say, a hedge fund manager who receives 20 percent of his fund's profits in a good year would also have to pay back 20 percent of losses in a bad one.,''These three simple regulations would go a long way to giving mutual funds a fair playing field competing with hedge funds,'' Mr. Pozen said. Not to mention making it much easier to keep fund managers from bolting for bigger bucks elsewhere. Kenneth E. Scott, a Stanford University law professor and another panelist, joked that extending new regulations to competitors ''is the usual way people talk about a level playing field.'',RICHARD A.

"Call it too much of a good thing. Last week, Vanguard Group closed its popular $10 billion Health Care fund to new investors, to stem the ''hot money'' chasing the fund's scorching performance. On the way to booking a 40.8 percent return in 1998, the fund took in more than $2.5 billion in new money. But much of the new cash is ''speculative'' money that could hurt long-term shareholders if the fund's hot streak cools and short-timers bail out, said John J. Brennan, Vanguard's chief executive. So the fund will likely stay closed for six months to a year, and any shares bought on or after April 19 will be subject to a 1 percent redemption fee if sold within five years. The fund isn't having trouble finding places to put its cash, but with inflows like the $564 million during January, it might have eventually  developed ''some size constraints,'' said Edward Owens, the fund manager.,RICHARD A.

"This March, the Nasdaq-Amex Market Group wants to begin trading a unit trust that will track the Nasdaq 100 index.,Simple enough. Except that Nasdaq-Amex, a unit of the National Association of Securities Dealers, wants the security to trade under the symbol ''Q.'' And that may make for a peck of trouble.,Single-letter trading symbols, prized as marks of prestige on Wall Street, have long been the province of Nasdaq-Amex's biggest rival, the New York Stock Exchange. Such one-letter symbols are trophies for blue-chip companies like Ford Motor and AT&T, which hold ''F'' and ''T,'' respectively.,Dan Noonan, an American Stock Exchange spokesman, said the symbol was chosen because of the ''Q'' at the end of Nasdaq. But a former Nasdaq insider said the Amex may be betting that the New York Stock Exchange will not balk at its foray into Big Board turf, because of the letter's tainted history. Wall Street lore holds that ''Q'' is bad luck, because it is associated with bankruptcy. For instance, when a firm goes belly up on Nasdaq, a Q is added to the end of its symbol.,It is uncertain whether the two exchanges will do battle over ''Q''; the Big Board has made no comment on the move.

"EUROPE'S big national telephone companies got a warning last week: the first attempted hostile takeover against one of their own.,It will probably be some time before anyone knows whether Olivetti's $58 billion bid for Telecom Italia will succeed. Yet the attempt itself highlights the fact that the European telecommunications industry is engaged in a turbulent free-for-all, where investors have racked up some stunning returns and once-lumbering telephone companies are trading at dizzying heights.,Faced with a crush of new competitors after decades as protected monopolies, many companies are losing market share and slashing prices. And Olivetti's bid will almost certainly put even more heat on Europe's former monopoly carriers to cut their costs, streamline their strategies and explain themselves better to investors. It could also spur additional merger bids.,Most of that should be good news for a range of telecommunications companies; investors will have to weigh those prospects against the sharp run-ups such stocks have already posted. France Telecom, for example, went public in 1997 at the equivalent of 28.5 euros and closed on Friday at 85.25 euros. ''I have been amazed that the stock has continued to go up and up,'' said Loretta J. Morris, a portfolio manager at Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management who bought shares at the initial offering.,Much the same momentum is true for shares of new competitors. The stock of Colt Telecommunications of Britain, which runs high-speed fiber optic networks around Europe, have climbed 275 percent to 1157.5 pence over the past 12 months. Mobilcom of Germany, a fast-growing reseller of long-distance service, has jumped nearly fivefold over that period, to 316 euros a share.,CONSIDER Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest telephone company and the one most wounded by new competition. It has lost 30 percent of its long-distance market since Jan. 1, 1998, when the European Union ordered member countries to open their phone markets to rivals. After being caught flat-footed, it has cut many long-distance prices as much as 70 percent.,Yet Deutsche Telekom stock has surged nearly 50 percent since the beginning of January and, at 41.8 euros per share, is near its record high. Indeed, shares have already passed the target prices set by both Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs.,Chris McFadden, European telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch, said there are good reasons for Telekom's rebirth. The most important is that German regulators have become more sympathetic to the company. In February, the Government ruled that rivals must pay higher fees to connect with Telekom's local phone network. That makes it more expensive for rivals to compete in the local market.,The company slashed its long-distance prices 35 to 62 percent and announced more cuts to come in March and April. The moves reassured investors that the company was regaining control.,Among Germany's new competitors, Mannesmann remains one of the most intriguing. Formerly a conglomerate known for its machinery and giant pipes, it has largely transformed itself into a telecommunications company. Shares closed at 122.7 euros on Friday, 73 times analysts'  estimates for 1998 earnings.,Its mobile telephone subsidiary, Mannesmann Mobilfunk, has been a spectacular success and has more subscribers than Deutsche Telekom. Mannesmann is also the controlling shareholder in Arcor, which competes against Telekom in traditional local and long-distance service.,But Mannesmann's most tantalizing prospects are now linked to the Italian takeover battle. Under Olivetti's takeover plan, Mannesmann would pay $8.5 billion for Olivetti's stake in Omnitel, Italy's second-largest cellular operator, and Infostrada, the country's biggest fixed-line competitor to Telecom Italia. Olivetti would then use the money to help finance its takeover. If that happened, Mannesmann would arguably be Europe's foremost competitor to traditional telephone companies.,''They have already proven that they are very efficient,'' said Francois Travaille, an analyst at BNP Equities. ''If they take control of Omnitel and Infostrada, that would be very, very good news for Mannesmann.'' Mr. McFadden of Merrill Lynch has set a target price of 150 euros.,Then there is the question of Telecom Italia itself. Before Olivetti's bid, many analysts and portfolio managers had singled out the company as a favorite. The main reason for optimism was the recent arrival of its new chairman, Franco Bernabe, who previously won praise for his sweeping and tough-minded overhaul of ENI, the Italian electric giant.,Since joining Telecom Italia 10 weeks ago, Mr. Bernabe has assembled a strategic plan that includes heavy cost-cutting and getting rid of extraneous businesses in real estate, insurance and other fields. The company also announced plans to buy back 10 percent of its shares and a new stock option plan for top executives. Telecom Italia's stock climbed from 4.5 euros last October to just over 9 before Olivetti unveiled its offer of 10 euros last week. It closed at 9.654 euros on Friday. Mr. Travaille has a target price of 12 euros.",EDMUND L.

"WHEN Peter Savignano heard about a house for sale on Sprague Avenue and White Plains Road (Route 22), the developer showed up at the door and negotiated a purchase on the spot. Then he knocked down the house and put up three more in its place.,Such is the demand for new construction in this populous town that developers like Mr. Savignano are scrambling for the last remaining parcels of buildable land, some in heavily trafficked commercial zones.,All along Route 22, which is largely commercial here, a number of new homes have been built in the last year or so, and have found buyers willing to pay $400,000 and up for large houses on little land on one of the most heavily trafficked thoroughfares in the county.,''I don't know what it is about Eastchester,'' said Veronica Gagiulo, owner of Tri Crest Realty. ''Maybe it's the proximity to Manhattan and its relative affordability in comparison to neighboring Scarsdale and Bronxville. But it's definitely a hot market for new construction, even on busy roads.'',Lynn and Lewis Tenzer were a bit concerned before buying their new four-bedroom colonial on Route 22, across from the 15.5-acre Vernon Hills Shopping Center. ''We were worried about raising a child in such a busy area,'' said Ms. Tenzer, whose husband is a financial analyst. ''But when we play in the backyard, we're not aware of the road at all. I don't think most people let their children play at the front of the house by themselves. And the house itself is beautiful and it's very quiet.'',Developers are finding to their surprise that some people, like the Tenzers, don't mind being on a busy road. ''A lot of the people are from the city and the Bronx,'' said Joseph Rogliano, a vice president with Eastchester Building and Masonry. ''They don't mind the noise. They're used to it.'',The sales of such homes is indicative of the strength of Westchester's market overall, said Lorenzo Signorili, an associate broker with Tri Crest Realty. ''People realize that these are really bargain prices for new construction. If the houses were just one street over, they would cost $100,000 more.'',It's really in the last two years or three years that demand has reached such a fever pitch that these commercial zones have become viable for residential construction, said Joseph Vonhout, the town engineer. ''Also some older people who lived on intersecting streets have moved out, and developers are subdividing those lots and putting three houses where there was one.'',As a result, the request for residential building permits has tripled in the last four years, according to Mr. Vonhout. ''We used to have maybe three or four new houses built in a year,'' he said. ''Now it's jumped to a dozen or more.'' By county standards, said Jim Cavanagh, the Town Supervisor, ''that's still a slow pace, but it's a lot for us considering the fact that we have no open space left.'',Last year was one of the best years for Ms. Gagiulo's office, much of it new construction, she said.,''We sold a new house in Eastchester on Christmas Eve,'' she said. ''We'd never done that before. And it hasn't slowed up. We know the developers and have kept up relationships with them when times were not as good. So we really seem to have a niche with the new construction.'',Any piece of land that becomes available has ''10 developers fighting over it,'' said Mr. Signorili. ''Bidding on land is a lot rougher now,'' he added.,RALPH AGOVINO, another developer, recently purchased one of the town's largest available parcels. A 1.33-acre site on Route 22, it is known as Apple Annie's property, named for a restaurant that once occupied it. Bidding against another developer, he wound up paying $2 million for the property, which is directly across from Eastchester High School.,The land had already been approved for nine town houses, with two units each. ''I knew the price was approximately $100,000 per residence,'' Mr. Agovino said. But he now wants to reconfigure the property for 13 single-family homes, priced between $575,000 to $799,000. The lowest-priced houses will be closest to Route 22, Mr. Agovino said. He added that one house is nearing completion on a lot with the original configuration.,Last Wednesday Mr. Agovino won final approval from the Planning Board to reconfigure the lots. Construction of his Apple Court project is expected to be completed in about a year.,The Apple Annie's property once held a mansion belonging to Alexander Turney Stewart, an Irish immigrant and Manhattan businessman credited with conceiving the modern department store and the founder of Garden City, L.I.,Over the years, the mansion was converted to commercial use and housed a series of restaurants, including Apple Annie's, which closed in the mid-80's. The building burned down in 1986 while awaiting renovation.,Five building lots at the back end of the property were sold off, leaving only the Route 22 frontage vacant. ''Apple Annie's is the last significant piece of property left in town,'' Mr. Cavanagh said. ''Now that it's being developed, we'll see individual lots being snapped up, and houses built here and there.'',The houses going up on these individual lots are often ''as big as the developer can get them,'' Mr. Cavanagh said. ''People are surprised when they see them sprout up. They didn't even know there was a building lot there.'',About two years ago, the town amended its zoning to limit the size of a house relative to the building lot. ''We had to place some controls as far as floor-to-area ratios,'' Mr. Cavanagh said, ''because developers were trying to use every square inch of land to construct these enormous homes.'',Ms. Tenzer calls her 3,000-square-foot house a ''mini mansion.'' ''We didn't want much land,'' she said. ''Who wants to take care of it? But we do use the back yard, which is a beautiful flat piece of property.'',The commercial nature of the location can even be an inducement to some buyers, according to Mr. Rogliano, the developer. ''We sold one house to a dentist who can use 25 percent of it for his business,'' he said. ''All the homes on 22 can be used for commercial purposes.'',And there are other advantages to being on Route 22,'' Ms. Tenzer said. ''I can walk to do my banking and shopping,'' she said.  ''I can also take my child right across the street to the Lake Isle Country Club to swim. People don't realize how attractive that is.''",MARY MCALEER VIZARD,"FEB. 28, 1999",In the Region / Westchester; Houses Sprout on a Commercial Eastchester Street,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-houses-sprout-on-a-commercial-eastchester-street.html
"A 119-UNIT market-rate town-house project and a neighboring 50-unit rental complex for low-  and moderate-income tenants, both being constructed by the same developer, are beginning to take shape in Holmdel in Monmouth County.,In Stanhope in Sussex County, one five-unit group home has been completed and another of the same size will start construction next summer. And in Washington Township in Morris County lower-income families, with financial assistance from the township, will be able to buy existing homes that will carry deed restrictions to make sure that the homes remain affordable to low-  and moderate-income purchasers.,The three examples suggest ways municipalities and developers are providing low-  and moderate-income housing across the state that differ from the high-density residential communities of the last decade. The units will help the towns meet their obligations under the State Supreme Court's Mount Laurel decisions, requiring them to provide housing opportunities for people earning 50 to 80 percent of the median income in the area.,The requirement, believed to be unique in the nation, led to many large-scale developments during the building boom of the 80's when some towns let developers build four market-rate units for every one addressing the needs of lower-income tenants or buyers -- units known as ''affordable.'' But by the late 80's residential development, including Mount Laurel housing, slowed.,In 1994 the Council on Affordable Housing, created under the 1985 Fair Housing Act to oversee Mount Laurel issues and monitor compliance, devised more flexible rules to help towns meet their share of the 83,000 affordable units the state says it needs by the end of this year. If a municipality's housing plan is approved by the council, which lacks enforcement powers, it is protected from suits by developers for six years.,Among other things, the rules enable towns to reduce the density of planned projects and receive two credits for each affordable rental built; those for the elderly get 1.33 credits per unit. Towns are also able to include in their fair-share obligation either group homes for the elderly or the mentally or physically disabled, or to provide mortgage subsidies to income-eligible families to buy homes priced at the lower end of the resale market.,Washington Township, for example, will make available $20,000 in mortgage assistance to up to 10 buyers of homes within its borders. The subsidy is to help bring market-rate housing within the reach of buyers whose income does not exceed 80 percent, or $51,760, of the area's median income. The median for a family of four is $64,700.,Applicants must also be approved for a mortgage, have at least $1,000 in savings and attend home ownership classes sponsored by the nonprofit Housing Partnership of Morris County. The homes must carry 30-year deed restrictions that cap the resale price.,One couple has been approved for a mortgage, said Susan M. Zellman, executive director of the partnership. ''This program allows people to buy a home where they want it and preserves the character of the community,'' she added.,The Council on Affordable Housing said that the resale cap may increase annually based on the percentage increase of maximum income eligibility. The council's revised rules, along with the state's strong housing market, have aided the production of affordable housing. And the shape of the projects that include such housing has changed to reflect today's market conditions, which favor one-family homes, rental housing and small upscale town-house communities.,''It has taken time for towns to focus on the options,'' said Shirley M. Bishop, executive director of the Council on Affordable Housing, part of the state's Department of Community Affairs. ''But they are now taking a more active role in determining which options to use and where the affordable housing is located.'' Meanwhile, she went on, ''developers perceive the market is hot and want to start projects,'' adding that ''each side is getting something they want.'',From the municipal perspective, ''anything that gives more flexibility to towns advances Mount Laurel,'' said Jeffrey R. Surenian of the Lomell law firm in Toms River, who represents towns in Mount Laurel matters.,Stephen Eisdorfer, a partner at Hill & Wallack, a Princeton-based law firm that represents developers in Mount Laurel cases, added: ''While towns and developers with mutual interests are negotiating deals, restructuring zoning, and building, no new sites are being zoned for Mount Laurel housing.'' What such arrangements ultimately will accomplish is unknown, he added.,Lawsuits persist, some of them tied to how existing affordable housing sites have been restructured. Others reflect the still strong resistance of some towns to Mount Laurel. Of the state's 566 municipalities, 237 have had or are in the process of having their housing plans approved by the Council on Affordable Housing or the courts.,MS. BISHOP conceded that some of the options could mean zoning for fewer affordable units. But they have also encouraged often smaller projects that reflect today's market. ''And they actually get built, which is the goal,'' she said.,The council estimates that since it started monitoring Mount Laurel compliance in 1987 more than 21,000 affordable residences had been built or were under construction as of June 30, 1998, up from 18,549 at the same time in 1997. Zoning is currently in place for 14,000 more residences.,In Stanhope, local officials are partnering with nonprofit operators to build and manage two group homes. One, for five developmentally disabled residents, was recently completed; the other, for five elderly tenants, will be built this summer. Both are on sites off Brooklyn-Stanhope Road that the borough conveyed or will convey to the developers.,The new homes, along with an existing one for three developmentally disabled residents, will fulfill the borough's obligation of 36 Mount Laurel units, of which 15 were to be produced through new construction. The rest were satisfied through the rehabilitation of existing units.,The group homes, ''provide a housing opportunity, especially for the elderly, at a much lower cost to the community than a high-density project,'' said Ms. Zellman, who is chairwoman of Stanhope's planning board as well as executive director of the Housing Partnership for Morris County. Built at the typical 4-to-1 ratio, she said, such a project would have generated 60 units, which would have taxed the borough's municipal services, particularly schools.,To help meet its remaining Mount Laurel obligation of 256 units, Holmdel worked out an agreement with Continental Properties of Woodbridge to build 119 town houses and 50 affordable rentals. They will rise on 33 acres at the corner of Route 35 and Laurel Avenue, which had zoning in place for 231 condominiums.,The project is part of Holmdel's affordable housing plan, which was revised in 1994 following state rules that such plans be updated every six years. This time the township wanted to take advantage of the options and ''fashion a plan that would have a minimum burden on the community,'' said Mr. Surenian, the attorney, who represents Holmdel on Mount Laurel matters.,In its earlier plan Holmdel, among other things, rezoned 12 sites for high-density  projects. Prior to 1994 six of the projects -- totaling 700 units, including 191 affordable ones -- were built, most of them in the township's northern sector along Route 35 where utilities are in place.,The result was overdevelopment in that part of the community, said Michael P. Bolan, of Banisch Associates, a planning and consulting firm in Flemington that represents Holmdel. The new plan ''addresses a higher percentage of the township's Mount Laurel obligation with fewer overall housing units,'' he said.,Continental Properties, for instance, agreed to build just 169 units, including the 50 affordable rentals, which with the 2-for-1 bonus will give Holdmel credit for 100 Mount Laurel units. Stephen Fisch, a Continental principal, said his company agreed to the revised plan because ''we would rather have 119 market-rate units we knew we could build, than take the chance on 231 units we were unsure would ever get built.'',Mr. Fisch said the town houses ''will be larger and more luxurious'' than those originally planned, meeting a demand from empty-nester and professional couples. That, along with buying the property at an ''attractive price,'' makes the economics of  the entire project work, he said.,The town-house project, Woods at Holmdel, will sit on 30 acres. The units, averaging 2,000 square feet, will have three bedrooms and one-car garages, and be in 18 two-story buildings. Pre-construction prices will be $205,000 to $250,000; common charges will be $116 a month, Mr. Fisch said.,The rental project, Laurel Village at Holmdel, will rise on the remaining three acres. The one-  to three-bedroom apartments, each with a private entrance and 700 to 1,150 square feet, will be in four two-story buildings. Monthly rents will be $575 to $850, said Mr. Fisch.,He said both projects, for which site work is under way, will be built over the next two years.",RACHELLE GARBARINE,"FEB. 28, 1999",In the Region / New Jersey; New Flexibility on Meeting Mt.

"A 408,000-SQUARE-FOOT office complex now awaiting final approvals -- Long Island's largest new office project in almost a decade -- could start construction as early as the spring.,Its 19.6-acre site is in the Smithtown side of Hauppauge at the intersection of the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway and Moreland Road at Exit 53 of the Long Island Expressway.,''This building will create a critical mass that doesn't exist right now on Long Island,'' said Bob J. Coughlan, the co-managing partner with his brother, Jim, of the Tritec Real Estate Company of East Setauket, the developer of the new building.,Other large office buildings are under construction. They include a 100,000-square-foot building under way at the Greenway Plaza Office Park in Melville and a 100,000-square-foot building rising in Woodbury at the Gateway Office Park. But a building has to be at least 150,000 square feet in size to justify the ''infrastructure we are developing,'' said Bob Coughlan.,Tritec -- whose other principals are the Coughlans' father, Bob T., and another brother, Dan -- is also the developer of the  million-square-foot Stony Brook Technology Center in East Setauket, which is about three-quarters completed.,One of Tritec's operating units, Tritec Capital, will arrange the financing for the $65-million Hauppauge project, which will be called 100 Motor Parkway.,Real estate brokers agree that the infusion of that large amount of space comes at an opportune time because vacancy rates in prime office buildings in Nassau County and most areas of Suffolk County have fallen to single-digit levels.,The vacancy rate for prime space in Nassau, including sublet space, was 4.95 percent at the end of January, according to the Commercial Industrial Brokers Society of Long Island in Syosset. Working with the CoStar/Realty Information Group, a data-base and statistical services company in Bethesda, Md., the society conducts monthly surveys of the Long Island market.,In Suffolk County, however, vacancies in first-class buildings rose from 7 percent at the end of December to 11.8 percent in January. The increase resulted from changes in the Melville market where, for example, the merger of Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and the Long Island Savings Bank freed up 220,000 square feet of space.,''However, that's more of an aberration and not indicative of the marketplace,'' said David Pennetta, the president of the Brokers Society who is also the executive director of Oxford & Simpson, a commercial brokerage in Jericho.,In fact, without large blocks of space coming on the market ''we could be in real trouble,'' said Theodore P. Sasso, senior managing director at the Syosset office of Insignia/ESG.,''Long Island has not as yet lost a large tenant because we were unable to accommodate them,'' he said. ''But we need new space to open up the boundaries.'',Insignia/ESG, an international commercial brokerage, is the leasing agent for 100 Motor Parkway, which could open for occupancy by the summer of 2000 depending on when final approvals are obtained.,THE building will become the gateway to the Hauppauge office corridor, and its arrival could encourage development of additional prime office space along Vanderbilt Motor Parkway, said Frank DeRubeis, Smithtown's planning director. As many as 25 acres, now underutilized, could be redeveloped for offices along the thoroughfare in line with Smithtown's master plan, he said.,In 1988, Evans Development of New York City had started construction of what was to have been the 350,000-square-foot Evans Financial Center on the same 19.6-acre site that 100 Motor Parkway will occupy.,Because of the collapse of the commercial market, the building never progressed beyond its foundation. EAB, a Uniondale bank, which had provided the construction loan, foreclosed on Evans and took over the property in 1990. Tritec is in contract to purchase the site from ABN AMRO Bank, the Dutch parent of EAB.,At one time, EAB proposed subdividing the site and selling off parcels to a fast-food chain among others, Mr. DeRubeis said. ''But I have always championed office development there because this site is ideally suited for that,'' he said.,In recent years, Hauppauge, which straddles both Smithtown and the Town of Islip, has begun rivaling Melville's Route 110 as an office center.,Computer Associates International, which built its headquarters on the Long Island Expressway in Islandia just east of Hauppauge in 1992, led the way in making central Suffolk a headquarters destination. Symbol Technologies followed in 1997, moving to a Holtsville building formerly owned by Northrop Grumman.,''East is no longer east as it was five years ago,'' said Raymond A. Ruiz, vice president of the Garden City office of CB Richard Ellis, who represents several landlords in the Hauppauge area. One of his clients is Crown Properties, which owns the 67,972-square-foot 1 Suffolk Square at Veterans Memorial Highway and the Expressway in Islandia. Another is Fortunato Development, which is currently adding a 60,000-square-foot building to its 200,000-square-foot Airport Corporate Center in Bohemia.,''There is no longer a sense of moving to Hauppauge to get a better deal,'' said Mr. Ruiz. ''The move is now based on residential trends, which are providing a growing labor pool, and the availability of space.'',''You're talking about a dynamic market with a lot of tenant growth,'' said Davar Rad, the chairman of Crown Properties, which is based in Garden City and has holdings around the country. It purchased 1 Suffolk Square in 1997 and Mr. Rad said vacancies only occur when a tenant needing more space moves out.,''At one time, central Suffolk was considered the end of Long Island for the corporate user, but now its the O.K. place to be for corporate America,'' said Mr. Pennettaof Oxford & Simpson.,Other prime office buildings in the Hauppauge area include the 123,000-square-foot Hauppauge Office Park on Veterans Memorial Highway and the 172,000-square-foot Islandia Pavilion on Vanderbilt Motor Parkway, both built in 1989. Another is the 191,447-square-foot Hauppauge Corporate Center at 150 Vanderbilt Motor Parkway, which was built in 1984. But 100 Motor Parkway will be by far the largest multitenanted office building so far east.,DESIGNED by Mojo Stumer Associates of Roslyn and the Baldassano Architectural Group of Ronkonkoma, 100 Motor Parkway will have two six-story towers connected by a skylighted concourse level under a landscaped plaza. The building's location will make it highly visible from the Expressway.,The building will offer up-to-date technology from video conferencing to Internet access, said Bob J. Coughlan of Tritex. A visitors' center will provide copiers, facsimile machines and access to the Internet. Diners in the building's cafeteria will be able to plug in their laptops at their tables. Both the cafeteria and health club, among other amenities, will be in the concourse.,The building's exterior will be blue-green tinted glass; the two main entrances will have three-story atriums, and exteriors will take orientation into account. For example, the south facade will have overhangs to keep out the glare of direct sunlight.,Annual rents at 100 Motor Parkway, which is now being marketed, are $25 a square foot plus electricity, said Mr. Sasso of Insignia/ESG.,Rents have reached $30 a square foot at the 1.2 million-square-foot EAB Plaza in Uniondale. At the new Greenway Plaza Office Park building in Melville, the asking rent is $28 a square foot, Mr. Sasso said.,''So not only are we less expensive than some of the other top-end buildings, but we have 400,000 square feet that will be the biggest block of available space when built,'' he said.,Being a tenant in a building of that size, brokers and developers say, is important to corporations because they like the idea of being able to grow without having to move out of their building for lack of space.,The Motor Parkway building could be built in two phases, but that will depend on how quickly the complex leases up, Mr. Sasso said. Several large companies have already expressed interest, he noted, even though construction has not yet started.,Bob J. Coughlan of Tritec said he felt confident that demand for space would continue to be strong. ''The Long Island economy is tremendous now and by every indication it will continue that way,'' he said.,Economists say the key has been diversification, with Northrop Grumman and other military contractors no longer the main  players in the region.,''Growth is slowing down, but we are still growing and I don't see 2000 as a recession year,'' said Thomas Conoscenti, a specialist in regional economics and public finance analysis with offices in Nesconset.",DIANA SHAMAN,"FEB. 28, 1999","In the Region / Long Island; For Hauppauge, a 408,000-Sq.-Ft.

"TRYING to auction a baseball signed  by Irwin Sternberg  that's right, Irwin Sternberg -- might fetch the cost of the ball, if that.,But Mr. Sternberg, whose $2 million bid wasn't enough to buy the ball Mark McGwire sent into orbit for his 70th home run last summer, is one of the people who make sports memorabilia worth as much as it is.,More important, Mr. Sternberg is one of those rare people who convert the awesome power of the Mark McGwires, Roger Marises and Babe Ruths of professional sports into something more valuable than a home run crown. His fundraising feats for such charities as cancer research, spinal cord injury and drunken driving are Ruthian.,The 52-year-old Mr. Sternberg, who was reared in Baltimore and has lived in Millburn for the past 16 years, is an owner of Stonehenge Limited, a Manhattan neckwear manufacturer. And since 1993, through the sale of neckties linked in novel ways to the charities they assist, Stonehenge has raised a total of about $2 million for such charities as the Christopher Reeve Foundation and Mothers Against Drunk Drivers,In short, Mr. Sternberg is a successful businessman -- Stonehenge's annual sales topped $30 million last year -- who has done well by doing good. He lives with his wife, Mina, and their three children, the 18-year-old twins Justin and Sean, and their daughter Kerri, 15, in a large Tudor-style house in the South Mountain section of Millburn. He plays golf and tennis and drives a blue Jaguar. ''He likes blue,'' Mrs. Sternberg said in an interview last week.,But lest anyone doubt his sincerity, they need only look up his sleeve. ''Look at my goose bumps whenever I talk about it,'' Mr. Sternberg said in a recent interview, unbuttoning the stiff white cuff of his blue dress shirt. ''I feel what I say.'',At Stonehenge's offices on Fifth Avenue, the walls are covered with multicolored silk ties, arranged like a huge butterfly collection in picture frames and pressed under glass. Mr. Sternberg was talking about the V Foundation, a cancer research fund and Stonehenge beneficiary established in memory of Jim Valvano, the beloved basketball coach at the University of North Carolina who died of bone cancer in 1993. It was at a promotional appearance last year with Pam Valvano, the coach's widow and chairwoman of the V Foundation, that Mr. Sternberg said he came to appreciate the meaning his ties could have for poeple.,''There was this woman in her 60's. And the woman said, 'I met Jim Valvano seven years ago, and I told Jimmy that I had cancer,' '' recalled Mr. Sternberg, who speaks in slightly raspy, expressive tones through a bushy mustache. ''And I said, 'Great! Great! You beat cancer, great!' And then she blew me away, and she said, 'Well, but I had to come in here again because I just found out I have cancer again. I have breast cancer. And I had to come in here, and I had to buy a tie. And as Jimmy said, I'll never give up.' '',''Moral of the story?'' Mr. Sternberg asked. ''That's why this tie is not a tie. To you, maybe, and others. But, to me, and to many, this is an inspiration of hope. This is for Jimmy's dream of 'Don't give up.' '',The designs for the Jimmy V collection are based on drawings by athletes and other sports celebrities. In a room where hundreds of their silky interpretations were hung on racks, Mr. Sternberg excitedly flipped through a loose-leaf binder containing the childlike originals. Darryl Strawberry, who has colon cancer, drew bright red strawberries against a plain white background, each with his number 39, and a caption below that read, ''Strawberry fields forever.'' His friend and a fellow cancer patient, Eric Davis of the St. Louis Cardinals, who batted .327 with the Baltimore Orioles last year after having a third of his colon removed, scrawled a smiling heart. Mark McGwire contributed a sunset that would look more at home hanging by a refrigerator magnet.,Mr. Sternberg began his career in Washington in the early 1970's, selling striped ties and other conservative apparel for Joseph A. Bank Clothiers. He left Bank in 1984, and came to New York to found Stonehenge with a business associate, Nathan Brach, when a takeover of Bank seemed imminent and Mr. Sternberg was unsure of his future. Mr. Brach remains Mr. Sternberg's partner to this day.,In 1993, Stonehenge was asked by the high magnetic field laboratory at Florida State University in Tallahassee, which developed an imaging process known as micrography, to help it raise money through the sale of ties based on molecular patterns of moon rocks as seen under a high-powered microscope. The resulting Molecular Expressions collection, which has raised $750,000 to date for the lab, led to the Ben & Jerry's Neckwear collection, based on molecular images of Chunky Monkey, Wavy Gravy and other flavors, and dedicated to fighting world hunger. The same micrographic design principle applies to the Cocktail Collection, which has raised $600,000 for Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.,Despite his bid for the McGwire ball, Mr. Sternberg is by no means a sports memorabilia collector. Had he won the bidding, he said, he would have sent the ball on tour for the V Foundation to provide a glimpse of sports history to children who have never been to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Instead, Mr. Sternberg said he plans to send another ball on tour, one signed by Ruth and Maris that he bought for $70,000. Mr. Sternberg asked Mr. McGwire to sign it but a spokesman for the Cardinal slugger said Mr. McGwire declined because he did not want to intrude on a Yankee artifact.,On Feb. 14, Mr. Sternberg put on a black tie to attend the ESPY Awards sponsored by ESPN, where he presented a check for $426,000 to Ms. Valvano.,''To raise that $426,000 in a year's time, I thought, was pretty remarkable,'' said Ms. Valvano. ''He's the most enthusiastic, warm, wonderful person that I've met.'',Dean Wilkerson, executive director of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, said Mr. Sternberg's imagination was constantly at work. ''Talking with Irwin is like trying to direct water out of a fire hydrant, he's got so many ideas,'' Ms. Wilkerson said.,Stonehenge contributed $65,000 to the Christopher Reeve Foundation after Mr. Sternberg suffered a stroke last year and underwent rehabilitation alongside the paralyzed actor at the Kessler Institute in West Orange. Joel Faden, treasurer of the foundaton, said Mr. Sternberg established the Christopher Reeve Collection ''as part of a business, and I'm sure he's making some money.'' But, Mr. Faden said, ''there's a pure philanthropic feeling.'',Despite his varied interests, Mrs. Sternberg said her husband has never let business or charity work keep him from being a full-time father. They married 23 years ago after meeting at the orthopedist's office in Washington where she worked. ''A week after he came in he wrote me a note saying, 'Would you like to go out with your 12 o'clock patient?' '' she recalled. ''It was definitely his personality, very bubbly. In fact, it's still the same.'',Mr. Sternberg said he came to the realization recently that his compassion stems from his own feelings of insecurity as a child. ''When I was in a very early grade in school, I went back a year because I had asthma and I lost a lot of time in school. And they put me into a slow learning class,'' he said. ''I was scarred deeply.'',He said the setback forced him to develop his sense of humor to win acceptance from his classmates. But it also made him rebel against school, and his mother later had to beg the University of Baltimore to admit her son. ''I just got a letter the other day,'' Mr. Sternberg said of his alma mater. ''They want me to be a speaker.'',Just this month the former haberdasher was honored by the Israeli Knesset for his Ties to Peace collection. He also has a picture of himself with the Dali Lama, which was taken after Stonehenge produced a Ties for Tibet collection, based on Tibeten carpets. ''All of a sudden I get a call from out of the blue from His Holiness,'' Mr. Sternberg said, still marveling at the incident. ''We're only a tie company.''",STEVE STRUNSKY,"FEB. 28, 1999",IN PERSON; A Sports Fan Who Likes Ties,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/in-person-a-sports-fan-who-likes-ties.html
"The scheduled departure in June of the state-appointed Newark School Superintendent, Dr. Beverly Hall, for the superintendent's post in Atlanta has set off a fusillade of rhetoric. Some of it rejoins the battles that greeted the state takeover four years ago, and some presses for changes that would round off the admittedly sharp edges of the takeover mechanism.,By far the most prominent voice is that of Mayor Sharpe James. He has long deplored the takeover, as well as the implicit and explicit charges that a quintessentially Newark corruption and cronyism characterized the old elected school board administration and conspired to crush student achievement.,Being shunned by Dr. Hall and state takeover administrators from the beginning, he in turn shunned them and missed few opportunities to portray them as carpetbaggers feeding on the 47,000-student district. (Dr. Hall was a deputy school chancellor in New York City before coming to Newark.) So far, he has not softened his tone, lambasting Dr. Hall's tenure here as a failure and her departure as disruptive.,There are other, less strident voices. Some make the point that an opportunity to ease tensions is being created by Dr. Hall's departure, as well as the resignation of another symbol of the takeover's acrimony, State Education Commissioner Leo F. Klagholz. The Rev. Edwin Verner, head of the Newark-North Jersey Committee of Black Clergy, said his group saw the personnel changes ''as kind of a new day'' and planned to meet with the next Education Commissioner, David Hespe, to promote its vision for a changed relationship.,Clement Price, a professor of history at Rutgers University and a member of the state-appointed advisory board for the Newark schools, said that although Dr. Hall never had the backing of elected officials, she did build a coalition of parents, teachers, foundation heads and corporate leaders -- all independent voices -- to back change. Now was the time, he said, to use that structure to examine the future of the 82-school system.,Dr. Price said the advisory board members had asked the state to delay the first steps that would return the schools to local control, postponing for a year the first election for spots on the advisory board, now scheduled for April. The extension would allow the board to ''strengthen our ties to the community,'' he said. Fifteen of the 18 current board members are considering running for the 9 seats on the elected board.,Others, including Carl Sharif, a member of the city's elected school board in the 80's, said the changes could help people get a therapeutic perspective.,''What happened four years ago was not so much a state takeover as a city giveaway,'' said Mr. Sharif, adding that it was impossible four years ago for local officials and residents to admit the extent to which they had mismanaged and damaged the school system. ''But you can't come in and say everyone is corrupt, and then say that everyone has to work with you to improve things and expect people to join in. That's what Bev Hall did, and now everybody has to agree to make themselves vulnerable, step back and reassess their roles.'',In an interview, Mayor James conceded that there was no real possibility at this time of returning schools in the state's largest city to full local control. At a minimum, the law requires a five-year period of state supervision before achievement levels are reviewed. What is possible, he said, was a broadening of the base of those involved in directing the schools while under state supervision, and he has suggested enlisting local business figures, foundation officials, elected officials and community groups.,''The Governor I think made a mistake with Dr. Hall,'' Mayor James said. ''The only standard she raised was her resume. We have to start all over since she has disrupted things. and I am willing to even remove myself from the process and put a business and community consortium at the top.'',Some of the Mayor's statements have troubled Rebecca Doggett, Dr. Hall's special assistant for community development, who says they echo the ''state of denial'' and personal vituperation of four years ago. She insisted there were many new people involved in the system now and expressed fear that these new voices could be drowned out by the old at a crucial time.,She said the city did not now have the ''shock'' of forced layoffs and economies that required Dr. Hall to dismiss about 600 people when she took over. Nor, Ms. Doggett said, are there the continuing corruption investigations by Dr. Hall's office that helped sour attempts to communicate with local elected officials.,''There are those who want to turn back the clock,'' she said, ''but I don't think that the new people will let that happen.'',Dr. Verner, who is a physician in addition to being an assistant pastor at St. James A.M.E. Church in Newark, seemed to recognize some of the same potential problems as Ms. Doggett. While the clergy group has worked well with Mayor James in the past, he said, its preference now was to not revisit the problems of the past, and not to work with or through the mayor.,''We work closely with the Mayor, but in this particular instance it seems as though the best line of communication is between the incoming Commissioner of Education and whoever he appoints as superintendent,'' said Dr. Verner, eschewing any direct criticism of Dr. Hall or the state itself. ''We don't see the current situation as hurting the state's credibility, but as enhancing the community's credibility and potentiality.''",RONALD SMOTHERS,"FEB. 28, 1999","In Newark, Changes for Schools Open Old Wounds and New Hopes",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/in-newark-changes-for-schools-open-old-wounds-and-new-hopes.html
"Years ago, travelers to Jamaica rhapsodized about its azure seas and friendly people. Errol Flynn, one of the many celebrity types who once frequented the place (Noel Coward and Ian Fleming were others), said it was where the folks who wrote the Bible ''got their descriptions of Paradise.'' Now, anyone headed to Jamaica gets a warning -- about the crime, the drugs, the unceasing hassles and hustles.,But there are at least two ways to avoid all of that and to enjoy the island's enduring beauty and neighborliness: One is to get away from it all and the other is to get above it all.,Jake's at Treasure Beach, on Jamaica's south-west coast, has its drawbacks. It's hard to reach -- more than two hours from the closest airport in Montego Bay, along one of Jamaica's typically poorly marked, pockmarked roads. A hurricane last year swept away Jake's beach, and though nature may one day restore it, the water there is rocky and treacherous. The more benign beaches nearby are undistinguished. Accommodations are Spartan; apart from a compact disk player and a small refrigerator, the most sophisticated electronic contraption in my hut was a Mr. Coffee that seemed to date back to the days of Joe DiMaggio -- his playing days, that is.,But by either exploiting or cultivating these apparent disadvantages, Jake's, where Sally Henzell and her son, Jason, began renting rooms in 1994, has become one of Jamaica's most distinctive, unpretentious and -- by its own deliberately limited terms -- popular resorts, a perfect place to unwind or, as the Jamaicans say, ''cool out.'',''Jake's is like a little rootsy hit single, a little piece of art coming out of the ground,'' Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records and the discoverer of Bob Marley, told me. Blackwell, who lists Jake's among his Island Outpost resorts but has no ownership interest in it (he can book you a room), is actually more specific: the particular record Jake's reminded him of was one of Island's first hits, Millie Small's 1964 song ''My Boy Lollipop.'' Like ''Lollipop,'' Jake's is a charming sleeper, a pleasant success story no one ever expected.,I arrived at Jake's late and a bit beleaguered. My flight was more than a hour late, and Air Jamaica had lost my luggage -- by all accounts, an alarmingly frequent occurrence. Then, upon landing, I had tried to drive a rented car. That's normally no big deal, but it's different when attempted on the left side of the road from the right side of the front seat on a rainy night. It was a harrowing experience -- entering a traffic circle is positively vertiginous -- and something no sane person should try. At the urging of an anxious rental agent, I soon yielded to a real Jamaican driver, who still took three hours to reach Jake's along the dark, wet washboard. Finally, we pulled up. And within moments, I felt more welcome, more part of the place, than I'd felt in various New York establishments I'd patronized for years.,''I was waiting up for you,'' the woman behind the desk told me cheerfully, as if her evening had been made by my arrival. Employees with uncanny memories and uncommon friendliness were quickly calling me by my first name and, after a slight interval, I was returning the favor. The woman greeting me was Odet, who, like most of the Jamaicans I encountered at Jake's and elsewhere, treats visitors with a mix of good cheer, dignity and a certain gentle panache. (''Could I borrow you for a minute?'' was how someone sweeping the floor asked me to move.) At Jake's, even the dogs are welcoming. Mornings, they greet you in your room; the rest of the time, they always seem to be lying contentedly at your feet, like Dagwood Bumstead's Daisy.,A nearby guest, a young Englishwoman, witnessed my arrival and heard my tales of woe. ''Show this man to the bar! I think this gentleman needs a Red Stripe!'' she declared, referring to the Jamaican brew of choice. The kitchen had closed, but a man named Boysie scraped me up a bowl of reed bean soup, redolent, like many Jamaican dishes, of the coconut oil one associates more with suntan lotions. He not only served it to me, but also kept me company as I enjoyed it. Then, with frogs and crabs and snails clearing ((MEANS FLEEING?)) the dark pathway, Odet led me to my hut. It was the only one with an air-conditioner, though with the fresh breezes and waves crashing not far off, air-conditioning never seemed so superfluous. Odet undid the braided mosquito netting, and draped it around the bed. On the bedspread lay two red hibiscus blossoms.,I think that beautiful spots are best approached at night: through the darkness, one can see and hear enough tantalizing hints of what awaits at sunrise to add an extra measure of anticipation. At Jake's, one awakens to a beehive of activity (sweeping, cleaning, polishing) along with a stunning ocean view and a riot of sherbet-colored flowers: oranges, yellows, magentas. They surround a miniature village of simple earthen huts, some on the cliffs over the water. All were designed by Mrs. Henzell, whose father built a beach house nearby in 1941. She is a fan of Antonio Gaud'i, the flamboyant Catalan architect; the very primitiveness of the cottages makes her decorative touches -- especially the omnipresent mosaics of birds and fish and palm trees and nothing in particular -- that much more striking and delightful.,Mrs. Henzell's husband, Perry, wrote, directed and produced ''The Harder They Come,'' the 1973 movie starring the reggae singer Jimmy Cliff. Their son, Jason, who actually runs the place, is a charismatic fellow, able to switch accents and swap personae and put other people -- be they guests, employees, local citizens or national politicians -- instantly at ease. (As for the eponymous ''Jake,'' he's a parrot who now lives with his inamorata at Trans Love, the restaurant down the road.),There are places to go to from Jake's, like Black River (where there is a crocodile refuge), and YS Falls. One can also go out on local fishing boats. But for most of those who come here -- generally Americans (usually from New York) or English, generally 30 to 50 years old, generally well-educated couples, generally more interested in authenticity and self-sufficiency than in marble bathrooms or room service -- it is a place to stay put, to schmooze, to catch up on your reading. Sit down in the front, where, despite the spectacular view there always seems to be an empty Adirondack chair, and you do not want to leave, at least until the sun sets.,Jake's is in the most remote and unspoiled part of Jamaica, an arid enclave where cactus plants coexist with palms. The closest newspapers, and only undernourished Jamaican papers at that, are several miles off. The rooms have no telephones or televisions; for news junkies there are sets in Jason's cottage and in the new ''games room,'' but no one watches them. There are no cell phones in sight.,You can take or leave your fellow guests; I chose to take them, and found them almost uniformly congenial and kindred. That's part self-selection, part local policy; Jason has discovered that by deliberately charging less than he could probably could get (rooms go for $95, suites for $150), he ends up with a friendlier, funkier clientele -- the kind of adventurous, low-maintenance people he likes hanging out with (and buying occasional drinks for) himself. ''They have something creative about them, even if they're lawyers,'' he explained.,When I told Jason I was staying for only two days, he appeared simultaneously disappointed and pitying. It takes at least four days for the place to soak in, he believes; the average American stays five to seven days, the average Brit nearly twice as long. But it takes less than 24 hours to learn the local cast of characters. Take Boysie. He's in charge of security, though in this part of Jamaica, where tourism is relatively scarce, religion deeply entrenched and the communities small and insular, crime is rare. There's Dougie, blender of Caipirissimas, lime drinks as sweet and seductive as Brazilian Caipirinhas but made from Jamaican rum instead of cachaca. But even Dougie has some doubts about their efficacy. ''Why drink and drive when you can smoke and fly?'' reads the sign behind the bar. In fact, the scent of ganjaa -- marijuana -- is sometimes in the air.,Jake's is not always the perfect refuge. On my second night there -- a Friday -- the din of music and voices from a club down the road drowned out the sound of the ocean, and until at least three in the morning at that. But this is Jamaica, Jamaica is exuberant, and it's good to be reminded of it. If you still want to sleep (as I did), bring earplugs.,As I was leaving my room, I spotted something I had neglected for my entire stay: the room key. Perhaps, with a wallet and computer and passport and camera around, it was foolhardy. But it sure was nice.,If Jake's is, to use Chris Blackwell's image, a 45-RPM record, Strawberry Hill, in the Blue Mountains overlooking Kingston, is an elaborate, expensive boxed set of CD's. It is also one of the jewels in Island Outposts, Blackwell's growing necklace of fancy boutique-style resorts (the most recent is Golden Eye, onetime home of Ian Fleming), which collectively have helped restore the island to the celebrity itinerary.,As a child, Blackwell, who sold Island Records a decade ago for more than $400 million, often came up to the place, 3,100 feet above sea level, visiting the old Great House for afternoon tea. He bought it in the 1970's and immediately began inviting his friends there because, as he told me, it is ''too precious'' not to be shared. The Rolling Stones made the trek up the hill; so did Bob Marley, to convalesce after being shot in 1976. The Great House was destroyed by a hurricane in 1988. Within a few years Blackwell had built a new, less great house for himself, a charming cottage on the back of the property. Since then he has added 12 villas, spending oodles in the process. Strawberry Hill, which officially opened in November 1994, is said to be losing money, but Blackwell is patient; he has told people that if it takes 20 years to turn the corner that's all right with him.,Strawberry Hill is a bit remote, unless, like some of its well-heeled celebrity guests, you spring for a $600 helicopter ride from Kingston. Otherwise, it's a 50-minute drive from the airport or 30 minutes from town, most of that up one of those steep winding roads bequeathed by the British. Its scale is about the same as Jake's -- 14 bedrooms. Here, too, the mission is to chill out, though since Blackwell joined forces a few years ago with Horst Rechelbacher of Aveda, the preferred tools are treatments, potions, fragrances and unguents. The place is expensive (my room was $280 a night) and if three to four days is the minimum stay at Jake's, it should be tops at Strawberry Hill -- enough time to take the measure of the place and to take the cure.,Blackwell's little villas are built into and wrap themselves around the hill. Their style, devised by an award-winning local architect named Ann Hodges, has been called Jamaican-Georgian: English colonial structures adapted to the tropics, with double-pitched cedar roofs (the better to endure hurricanes), wooden louvers and stately verandas. Some overlook Kingston, while other face the Blue Mountains and the cumulus clouds spilling over them.,Inside, each of the rooms has mattress warmers, not only for coziness but to protect against the mildew endemic to humid mountain climes. They are filled with classic Jamaican furniture -- heavy, dark, simple and substantial -- built in Strawberry Hill's own workshops. The suites are ornamented with elaborate fretwork, some of it whimsical. As at Jake's, there is a feeling of total isolation, though that can be misleading: A neighbor's hacking cough had me thinking for a time that the mountaintop retreat I'd come to was Thomas Mann's ''Magic Mountain.''.,Arriving late at night once more, I was escorted to my room, known as Timbuktoo. Inside, all is white and woody and wainscotted. The only thing missing from the Somerset Maughham tableux was a ceiling fan, which can't co-exist with the mosquito netting. There was a telephone and a television set, albeit with a limited selection of programs: CNN Headline News and re-runs of ''Zorro'' were just about it. From my veranda I could see all of Kingston; while defensive Jamaicans from everywhere else routinely depict it as the hub of all the island's crime, from here it twinkled as seductively as any other city. Meantime, a few fireflies flickered in the foreground. Somewhere in the distance, the sound of reggae rumbled late into the Saturday night. But by sunrise all had grown quiet.,Even by the standards of a place where the weather seems to change every 30 minutes and every 30 miles, the climate at Strawberry Hill is fickle; short sun showers andglorious rainbows are almost a daily occurrence. (And sometimes when it's not raining, the occasional rustle of leaves from plants Henri Rousseau could have painted makes it sound as if it is.) The resort is at one with nature. One morning a grasshopper kept me company for my entire breakfast, nestled somewhere between the cup of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee and the granola (again, with essence of coconut oil). It left me alone and I happily reciprocated. The food - nouveau Jamaican - is several cuts above that at Jake's, and the coffee was delicate and distinctive.,Blackwell has said that he wants his guests to feel as if they're staying in a home rather than in a hotel. But at times the nest felt empty. It's hard to tell whether Strawberry Hill is underpopulated or if its guests are simply off by themselves. Celebrities frequent Strawberry Hillthe place -- past habitues include Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Johnny Depp, Bono, Sting, Dennis Hopper and Ben Kingsley -- and they seem to set the tone: they want to be left alone. It's a bit lonely at the bar, where Desmond (who also supplies the kitchen with eggs) squeezes limes for his labor-intensive rum punch. Even emptier is the games room, whose library contains what looks like a first edition of Kinsey's ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' along with less scientific fare. Until one gets to the spa, where the attendants are unfailingly friendly, there are not a lot of first names at Strawberry Hill. The employees, while pleasant, are more distant, the atmosphere rather British colonial. One is not surprised to find a patch of lawn near the bar, where croquet is occasionally played.,Though the place is officially in Irish Town, there's no town as such around. There are a few things to do near Strawberry Hill -- walks to the Anglican Church up the slope, or to the rain forest (a national park) still higher up; perhaps a tour of the nearby Ueshima Coffee plantation, which helps feed the gigantic Japanese appetite for Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. Some visitors go to Port Royal, once known as ''wickedest city in the world'' -- or to Trench Town, home of Bob Marley and a place that, while not necessarily the world's wickedest, may be among its most dangerous (use only well-connected ((HOW SO?)) cab drivers). But for the most part, one stays put. That's where the spa, opened last year and nestled behind and below the gift shop, comes in.,Shortly after check-in at Strawberry Hill, all guests are invited to the spa for a free ''ministree relieving treatment'' - basically a massage of the head and shoulders. But just walking into this aromatic and immaculate place seems soothing. This is also a convenient time to book the treatments you'd like over the next few days. These range from simple manicures to the Himalayan Rejuvenation Treatment, which costs $170 and involves, among other things, having custom-scented steam pointed between your eyebrows. I say custom-sented because its fragrance is geared specificlly to the particular psychological baggage you have been determined to be carrying.,My ''personal blend,'' which accompanied me through a scrub, massage and some hydrotherapy (in which seven water jets were aimed at the chakras, or energy centers, along my spine), was delightful. But between Jake's and Strawberry Hill, the magical scent had become quite secondary. By the time I left these places for home, my return baggage consisted largely of carry-on serenity.,On the Beach, On the Hill,Jake's is at Calabash Bay, Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth (876-965-0635; fax: 876-965-0552), a two-hour drive from Montego Bay or an hour-and-a-half drive from Negril, on the western end of the island.

Idoni of New Rochelle reported last week that he and Mr. Spano were in preliminary discussions about the future of the island.,Most recently, David Blumenthal, principal owner of the Davids Island Redevelopment Company, proposed a hotel, a children's theme park, a museum and science center, a marina, a public boardwalk and housing on what was once Fort Slocum.,Before that, Donald J. Trump, the developer and casino owner, planned to build 47 mansions on Davids Island, but he pulled out of the deal in 1996 in part because of conflicts in ownership of the property, he said. In the early 1990's, environmentalists opposed a $1 billion condominium proposal by Xanadu Properties Associates.,Also, former County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke had proposed converting the island to a waterfront park accessible by ferry. The island is less than a mile from the mainland.",ELSA BRENNER,"FEB. 28, 1999",IN BRIEF; Davids Island,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/in-brief-davids-island.html
"How deep is the hatred?,After being sentenced to death in Jasper, Tex., last week, John William King was asked if he had anything to say to the relatives of his victim, James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was chained to a pickup truck and dragged along a country road until his body literally was torn apart.,King, a 24-year-old white supremacist, did indeed have something to say. Grinning, he assured all within earshot that Mr. Byrd's grieving survivors were welcome to perform a sex act on him.,Most Americans would like to believe that the attack on Mr. Byrd was an aberration, that it was so far over the top, so sick and inhumane, that it should not be viewed as representative of a much larger societal problem. The reasoning is more or less as follows: The vast majority of Americans were repelled by the murder, arrests were quickly made, and the legal steps toward the ultimate societal sanction are already being taken. Let's move on.,That attitude presupposes that race hatred and other forms of prejudice and intolerance in America are not nearly as deep or as dangerous as the attack on Mr. Byrd might suggest.,A long litany of tragedies tells us otherwise.,Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student in Wyoming, died last fall after he was kidnapped, robbed, tied to a fence, beaten in the head with a .357 Magnum, tortured with cigarettes, taunted as he wept and begged for his life, and finally left alone and helpless in near-freezing temperatures. Authorities said he was murdered, at least in part, because he was gay.,A recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate crimes and hate groups across the country, is filled with other horrible examples that occurred last year.,In February, the report said, a dark-haired young woman named Amy Robinson was abducted in Fort Worth, Tex., and murdered by two white men who used her for target practice. They were reported to have burst out laughing when she died. The original plan, according to one of the men, was ''to go out and shoot black folks.'' Ms. Robinson was chosen because the men thought she was biracial. They were mistaken. Ms. Robinson was, in fact, white.,In October in Buffalo, N.Y., a group of black teen-agers attacked a 41-year-old white man, Gary Trzaska, as he was walking to his car. Mr. Trzaska, who was gay, was beaten and stomped to death. Witnesses said they saw the teen-agers jumping high in the air so they could land on Mr. Trzaska's head with both feet. They said the boys appeared to be gleeful as they killed their victim.,Last spring a group of whites ''armed with brass knuckles and chanting 'white power' '' attacked Lance Cpl. Carlos Colbert, a 21-year-old black Marine, as he left a party in San Diego, Calif. As many as 30 men joined in the assault. Corporal Colbert was not killed, but his neck was broken. He is paralyzed from the neck down.,Last May a racially charged exchange in a bar led to the murder of Mark Dale Butts, a 35-year-old white man. He was beaten to death in a cemetery in Victor, Colo., by a group of black men and teen-agers. A shovel was used in the attack. Authorities said Mr. Butts was beaten so hard the handle of the shovel eventually broke.,Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Law Center, said he is surprised by what appears to be the increasing frequency and viciousness of such attacks. They are being committed by whites and blacks, he said. Much of the hatred is fueled by the growing number of organized hate groups and the proliferation of Internet sites devoted to racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of intolerance.,The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder of James Byrd in Jasper, Tex., is understandable. Once justice is done, what's the point of wallowing in the hideousness of the crime?,But there is a need to understand the rage and the frustrations and the impulses that lead so many of us to mayhem in the name of some warped sense of superiority, or inadequacy, or fear, or whatever.,Dragging someone to his death behind a truck may be unusual. But torturing, maiming and killing people because they fit a certain despised profile is an everyday occurrence. We can hardly stop it if we're not even willing to look at it.",BOB HERBERT,"FEB. 28, 1999",In America; Staring at Hatred,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/opinion/in-america-staring-at-hatred.html
"To the Editor:,Jonathan Keates's review of Paolo Maurensig's ''Canone Inverso'' (Jan. 31) dismisses the Italian novel after ''I Promessi Sposi'' (1825), by Alessandro Manzoni, as a genre that became ''a playground for dilettantism, technical experiment and symbolist fantasy,'' and Keates labels Italo Calvino's influence on modern Italian letters ''disastrous.'',On the contrary, 19th-century Italian novelists, without reaching the peaks of their French or Russian contemporaries, created a fairly original realist school, which used technical experiments and symbolist fantasy quite episodically, often in the most peculiar way. Writers like Antonio Fogazzaro, Luigi Capuana, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Giovanni Verga, Federico De Roberto and several others, from the 1870's to the 1930's, gave Italian narrative a proper, substantial status.,As for Calvino, the variety of his productions and the fact that he died too recently should by themselves prevent the identification of any school deriving immediately from him. Unfortunately, his influence seems to me to have been too light. Otherwise, contemporary Italian authors would write much better than they actually do.,Paolo Bernardini,Princeton, N.J.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",Il Romanzo,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/l-il-romanzo-414875.html
"ELLEN FERRETTI'S blue eyes glistened when she recalled how, in the 1920's, she romped in her backyard at the crossroads of Route 59 and Middletown Road in the Rockland County hamlet of Nanuet, watching the wild animals roam the wetlands where the 120-store, 900,000-square-foot Nanuet Mall now stands.,''There was also a little stream that once ran through the parking lot of the mall where I skated when it froze,'' said the 82-year-old Miss Ferretti. She said the owner of the mall had offered to buy the seven-room house in which she was born to build an addition on to the shopping center. ''But no matter what they offer me this is where I want to stay,'' she said. ''This is home. I'm quite contented here. Where am I going to go that's better?'',Nanuet, in the Town of Clarkstown, ''is simply not Route 59 or the Nanuet Mall, but a series of communities that are real neighborhoods,'' said Charles E. Holbrook, the Supervisor of Clarkstown.,In the last 10 years, the hamlet has grown by more than 4,000 to its present population of about 15,000. Housing construction has been pumped up and several new businesses have been lured to the hamlet's strip malls, including Office Max, which opened last fall; Home Depot, scheduled to open in the fall and a Super Stop & Shop now under construction.,It's not just the rustic neighborhoods and shopping opportunities that have lured both newcomers and returning second-  and third-generation Nanuet families. For the hamlet is conveniently situated at the crossroads of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and the Palisades Interstate Parkway, has well-respected schools, reasonably priced housing, a variety of recreational activities and an assortment of restaurants that cater to families.,One food landmark is the Rockland Bakery on Demarest Mill Road, which for 30 years has let shoppers pass through yellow swinging doors into the production room where they can don plastic gloves, grab bags and choose their breads straight off oven racks and pick bagels off conveyor belts before they have even cooled. The bakery is open 6 A.M to 10:30 P.M. Sunday through Friday and until midnight on Saturday.,Real estate brokers said that they have had a hard time keeping up with the recent housing demand in Nanuet. ''We have a big-time shortage of inventory, especially at the $190,000 to $250,000 range,'' said Patrick Nealon Sr., owner/broker at Century 21 Patriot Realty in bordering Pearl River. ''When a house comes on the market, it's sometimes only hours before it disappears.'',Two centuries ago, this now bustling hub of Rockland County was pastoral. In 1797, the hamlet was named Nannawitt's Meadow after Nannawitt, a migratory Kakiat Indian who settled in the area now occupied by the Nanuet Mall. The Erie Railroad arrived in Rockland County in 1841 and after several name changes the hamlet settled on the name of Nanuet, a corruption of Nannawitt, in 1856.,Maxwell Anderson drew attention to the hamlet in ''High Tor,'' a play based on the robbery that took place at the Nanuet Bank in 1936. The advent of the Tappan Zee Bridge in 1955 brought changes to the area that are still continuing.,TODAY, many first-time home buyers are attracted to the three-  to four-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath, 1,500-square-foot Cape Cods on a third to a half acre ranging in price from $200,000 to $225,000, said Mr. Nealon. From there, housing prices jump to $275,000 for high ranches and colonials with three to four bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths.,Gretchen and Richard Donlan, a communications engineer in New City, who moved from Nyack to Nanuet in August with their three sons, bought a 2,600-square-foot, four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath colonial on a third of an acre for under $300,000.,''I was always coming from Nyack to shop here so, why not be here anyway,'' she said. ''I was pleased with what I found. I feel we did well. We got good value, an ideal location and a family neighborhood. This is our final home. It would be too pricey if we ventured anywhere else.'',James Damiani, owner/broker at Damiani Realtors in Pearl River, said what keeps the homes affordable is that the Nanuet Mall and Wyeth Ayerst pharmaceuticals, which sprawls from Nanuet into Pearl River, takes the tax burden off homeowners.  ''Nanuet is a relatively good buy in Rockland County,'' he said.,Among the costlier homes in Nanuet are new custom colonials on one-third to one-half acre in the 61-unit Briarwoods Farms, a subdivision that opened in 1997, said Christine O'Toole, an associate broker at Patriot. These four-bedroom houses start at $279,900 and go up to $350,000, said Ms. O'Toole.,This August, she said, construction is scheduled to be completed on 22 Victorian and classic colonials on one-half acre lots in Rose WoodEstates, where prices begin at $369,000 four bedrooms and rise to $459,000 for five bedrooms.,Most new construction in Nanuet has been condominiums and apartments. According to the office of the Nanuet building inspector there are 2,824 condominium units in Nanuet, including Normandy Village, Sussex at Bremmer, Gramercy Park, The Hamlets, New Holland Village, Omni Park and Tudor Hill. They range in price from $80,000 for a one-bedroom to $200,000 for a two-bedroom unit, said Linda Viglietta, a broker with Weichert Realtors in Nanuet. The most upscale of these is The Hamlets which has units with fireplaces and offers a clubhouse, swimming pool and a tennis court, she said.,At the Amber Fields development, the 240 recently completed town-house condominiums, ranging in price from $140,000 for a one-bedroom to $200,000 for a two-bedroom unit, have been sold out, according to Cindy Phillips, a sales agent for the developer, K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J.,There is a total of 516 rental garden apartments in Avalon Gardens, Normandy Village and Jean Marie Gardens. Rents range from $900 for a one-bedroom to $2,100 for a three-bedroom unit, said Ms. Viglietta.  The most luxurious of these is Avalon Gardens, where there is a clubhouse and a pool and many units include fireplaces.,Janet Halecky, a vice president of the Bank of Central Asia, moved from Washington Heights in Manhattan into a 1943 colonial here with her 13-year-old son, Stephen, in July 1997. She said that while she loved her home, the impact of the Nanuet Union Free School District on her son has meant even more to her.,''Stephen has gone from being a C or C- student to a B student,'' she said. ''In the city, Stephen was begging me at least once a week not to go to school. But here the teaching methods are so different. He's learning things in such an interesting way he really enjoys it. He looks forward to school.'',The philosophy of the 1,905-student school district is simple, said Superintendent Mark S. McNeill. ''We're the smallest school district in Rockland County,'' he explained.  ''This permits us to have only one elementary school, one middle and one high school on one campus with approximately 150 students per grade. Such a close-knit school district lets kids get lots of experience with each other. There's tremendous value to this.'',In 1997, the district received the New York State Music Educators Association President's Award for having the top performing arts program in the state from kindergarten through grade 12. The students are constantly exposed to the arts through guest performers and lecturers, said Dr. McNeill.,Among them were Bette Glenn, an actress in ''Guys and Dolls,'' and Don Johanson, an actor/dancer in ''Cats,'' both Nanuet residents with children in local schools.,At the k-4 George W. Miller Elementary School, students study the violin in second grade and branch out in grade four to instruments of their choosing, eventually moving on to jazz, choral or orchestral ensembles.,The MacArthur Barr Middle School, which cover grades 5 to 8, and the Nanuet Senior High School have unusual ''smart labs,'' said Dr. McNeill, which enable students to learn state of the art microelectronics, satellite communications and pre-engineering technology through software and apply what they learn into building, for example, a four-foot wind tunnel.,Eighty-six percent of last June's graduating class of 133 seniors went on to higher education. S.A.T. averages last year were 523 in verbal and 521 in math, compared with the state averages of 495 on the verbal test and 503 on math.,TEN percent of the pupils in the district attend parochial or private schools.  Some are enrolled in the school at the Roman Catholic St. Anthony's Church, which covers pre-k through eighth grade.  Annual tuition for parishioners is $1,450 and for nonparishioners, $2,200.,For recreation, residents can swim in Lake Nanuet, part of a 33.5-acre park which includes a water slide, bathhouse, a ballfield with lights, picnic area, children's playground and a basketball court, said Jo Anne Oldenburger, assistant superintendent of  recreation and parks for Clarkstown. The nine-acre Tennyson Park in the hamlet has a ballfield, a children's playground and two basketball courts. All Clarkstown residents have free access to the town's three pools and its 21 parks, said Ms. Oldenburger.,''In the city, I never knew what corner Stephen would be on,'' said Ms. Halecky, who moved here from Washington Heights. ''Here, in this country atmosphere, I don't have to worry. He can be in the parks, in someone's yard or in the playground. I still commute to the city, but I don't miss living there. I relish home.''",CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK,"FEB. 28, 1999","If You're Thinking of Living In / Nanuet, N.Y.; Growth Quickens In Rockland Hamlet",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-of-living-in-nanuet-ny-growth-quickens-in-rockland-hamlet.html
"HOLLY stays conservative,'' reads the Charles Schwab ad featuring real customers and their stock portfolios. ''Howard makes a move.'',So what if Holly, identified as a part-time teacher who also teaches investing to her daughter's fifth-grade class, shows $6,560.71 in her account and Howard shows $2,438,665.95? They are both in the game, both part of a profound transformation in American life -- the way the aspirations, fears and machinations of the world of finance, once the province of the wealthy few, have become indelibly interwoven into mainstream culture.,As Washington's noisy sideshow fades, millions of Americans are refocusing on the thing that most defines their lives, the upward and downward ticks of interest rates, the gyrations of their mutual funds, the achingly palpable lure and temptations of wealth. What this is doing to the country -- from money to values -- is one of the most intriguing questions about American life at the century's end.,''Greed is not a new thing,'' said Roger Shinn, a professor emeritus of social ethics at the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, who has also taught business ethics at New York University. ''But I think the present situation is different in many respects. Money is less tangible. It used to be property or gold. Now it's a blip on your computer screen. It appears and disappears. It becomes more a way to keep score, more a game in its own right, the way athletes compete with each other to make the most millions, when each additional million can't possibly matter to the way they live.'',Until recently, true wealth for most Americans seemed as distant as Bombay.,Now, a stroll through any bookstore gives a crash course on what they want, whether it is ''Simple Abundance'' or ''More Than Enough'' or ''How to Retire Rich.'' They know that ''It Takes Money, Honey.'' They want to be ''The Millionaire Next Door.'' They read Money and, to be safe, Smart Money, too.,THE lure of wealth is as old as the Bible. And from the robber barons of the 19th century to the Wall Street tycoons of the 1980's, striking it rich has been part of the American myth. But, in at least four ways, money is woven into the fabric of daily life today in a way it never was in the past:,First is the aging of 78 million baby boomers, whose needs, wants and fears dominate American culture. Faced with looming financial needs for their children's college and their own retirement, many find themselves confronting the kind of saving and investment they had neglected.,Second is the relentless march of the bull market, which has made millions wealthy and millions more think they should be.,Third is the credit revolution, with more tempting cards arriving in the mail every day, which has made it possible for people without money to spend and live like the rich.,Fourth is the way marketing suffuses the culture from the toy-of-the-moment on Saturday-morning cartoons to the disparate images of seniors as either on-the-go consumers or near invalids.,For many Americans, of course, the goal is getting by, not getting rich. Robert H. Frank, a Cornell University economist and author of ''Luxury Fever'' (The Free Press, 1999), says half of the respondents in a recent survey reported life savings of less than $3,000 and another 40 percent said it would be ''a big problem'' if they had to deal with an unexpected bill for $1,000. Meanwhile, more than 35 million Americans, or 13.3 percent, live in poverty.,But almost half of American households now own stock either directly or through pension or retirement plans, compared to less than a third at the beginning of the decade and less than 1 in 10 in the 1960's . This comes at a time when a hot stock like Dell Computer can rise by 4,200 percent in three years and then lose nearly 20 percent of its value in four days as it did earlier this month, making the riches and risks of the market gut-wrenchingly immediate.,Before the current bull market, who could have imagined that newsstands would feature a gaggle of glossy magazines with cover articles trumpeting one or another Ultimate Mutual Fund Guide, as if the subject has the sex appeal of supermodels in bikinis on Polynesian beaches.,The new crop of financial books blends the language of money with the spirit of the human potential movement. ''I have come to think that money is very much like a person,'' writes Suze Orman in ''The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom'' (Crown Publishers, 1997), ''and it will respond when you treat it as a cherished friend -- never fearing it, pushing it away, pretending it doesn't exist or turning away from its needs, never clutching it so hard that it hurts.'',''The Millionaire Next Door,'' by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko (Longstreet Press, 1996), has been on the best-seller list since January 1997, with its comforting message that the rich are just like the rest of us, only cheaper.,DAVE Ramsey, who has a syndicated financial counseling show on 44 radio stations, mostly in small and medium-sized markets outside the Northeast, mixes biblical proverbs and self-help in his ''More Than Enough: Proven Keys to Strengthening Your Family and Building Financial Peace'' (Viking, 1999), which begins with a woman sobbing at her ''point of rebirth'' as she comes to terms with her attitudes toward money.,''The spiritual aspect of personal finance, learning to control the guy in the mirror, is more important than doing the math,'' he said.,Still, the focus on finance is pulling Americans in opposite directions. On the one hand, there have never been so many temptations to spend. As a result, nearly 20 percent of American households have more debt than assets. When real estate is factored out, the bottom 40 percent of Americans have more debt than assets.,On the other hand, books like ''The Millionaire Next Door,'' or the success of Warren Buffett's plain-folks investing and personal style are creating at least talk of a new ethic of frugality.,''I have a lawyer friend who says, 'Why would anyone want to spend money when it's so much more fun to count it,' '' said Shad Rowe, who heads an investment firm in Dallas. ''Warren Buffett has made it respectable to be a miser again.'',Ritchie Lowry, a Boston College sociologist and longtime advocate of socially responsible investing, said the focus on wealth primarily reflects fears that the current prosperity will not last. With 24 percent of household wealth now invested in stocks, up from 10 percent at the time of the 1987 crash, Americans may be right to feel financially vulnerable.,But others say that prosperity and the current vogue for finance has its perils, too.,John Maynard Keynes once looked forward to an era when the task would be managing prosperity ''which science and compound interest will have won'' to live wisely and well. In that era, he said, excessive  lust for money would be seen as ''a somewhat disgusting morbidity.'',That may come to pass, and the current prosperity has its inspirational tales, like the example of Donald and Mildred Othmer, who lived quietly in Brooklyn, and after investing with Mr. Buffett left behind three quarters of a billion dollars for favored universities and charities.,But Mr. Shinn said American culture has always been wildly conflicted about wealth, particularly when  great affluence coexists with bruising poverty.,''The Bible is full of condemnations of wealth in the face of poverty,'' he said. ''In Jesus and the Prophets and elsewhere there's a bias in favor of the poor. There's the Sermon on the Mount. Luke said: 'Blessed are you, poor. Woe unto you that are rich.' The Catholic Popes call this the epistemological privilege of the poor, that the poor are spared the arrogance that comes with wealth and power. So we're very mixed up on this. We're uneasy about wealth. But we're sure getting over the unease in a hurry.''",PETER APPLEBOME,"FEB. 28, 1999",Ideas & Trends; When Money's a Mantra Greed's a New Creed,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-when-money-s-a-mantra-greed-s-a-new-creed.html
"PERHAPS only in New Orleans could the dead be a special interest group. Their influence was recently illustrated when the City Council passed an ordinance requiring antiques dealers and auction houses to report to the police within 24 hours any cemetery artifacts that come their way. The law is a response to thieves plundering the historic ''cities of the dead'' and selling caches of marble angels and blessed mothers to local antiquarians. Among those arrested were several well-respected antiques dealers who, police say, knowingly purchased ornaments stolen from the graves and may even have placed orders, as if history were an a la carte menu.,''Pawnbrokers have always had reporting requirements,'' said Louise Fergusson, executive director of Save Our Cemeteries, the most venerable of the city's three cemetery preservation groups. ''Now that antiques dealers are dealing in stolen artifacts they are going to have to deal with the consequences.'',The spectacle of historic family tombs, most of them from the 19th century, robbed in broad daylight has raised the profile of those dedicated to preserving cemeteries and protecting the dead. Their worst enemies may be decorators and antiques dealers pushing the necro-politan look for the garden, the more mouldering the statuary the better. The look was in full flower in Manhattan last week at the Gramercy Garden Antiques Show, where several weeping angels -- one with an $875 price tag -- were spotted amid the rusting garden benches and freshly spritzed topiary. And that may just be the beginning.,''Theft is not limited to architectural objects, gates and statuary,'' said Katie Karrick, a historian in Lyndhurst, Ohio, who publishes Tomb With a View, a newsletter for cemetery enthusiasts (http://members.aol.com/ TombView/twav.html). ''My latest pet peeve is the use of metal detectors on grave sites to find lost or intentionally placed coins, jewelry and other objects.'' Ms. Karrick works as a historian at the Wade Memorial Chapel in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. The chapel is famous for its Tiffany lamps, pews and mosaics. Five years ago, two bronze statues from the 1920's were stolen and have yet to be recovered.,In New Orleans, Save Our Cemeteries recently completed a digitized tomb-by-tomb data base for Lafayette Cemetery No. 1, one of the most alluring and storied of the city's 31 cemeteries. Neglect remains a problem, particularly at St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 and No. 2 on the fringes of the French Quarter, where street crime deters many families from regularly visiting ancestral tombs.,The mobility of families and churches has taken a toll. ''We are trying to locate families who have some relationship to the deceased and who will take an interest in restoring the tombs,'' said Michael D. Boudreaux, director of the New Orleans Archdiocesan cemeteries, which include the St. Louis cemeteries.,In New England, where graveyards have long been plagued by thieves, those who own or curate historic cemeteries are breaking their silence, alerting antique buyers to tell-tale funerary motifs: winged hourglasses (the swiftness of time), garlands (victory in death), willows (mourning), scythes (Father Time) and leaning tree trunks (short interrupted life).,Groups like the New England Cemetery Association, based at Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, encourage families to photograph and document tombs. The private Art Loss Register, based in New York City, tracks stolen artwork for a fee and played a major role in retrieving a $50,000 fountain stolen from a Missouri cemetery.,In Florida and Texas, state agencies are surveying rural cemeteries, including plots of the poor simply marked by river rocks or seashells. ''Families move, local memory becomes fuzzy and the next thing you know the lot is for sale,'' said Jim Miller, the Florida state archaeologist. In rural Georgia and elsewhere in the South, the tradition of placing pottery on graves has made black burial grounds especially vulnerable to theft as the collectors' market for Southern folk pottery flourishes. These fragile, out of the way places, often unmarked except for depressions in the earth, have become ''incentives for illegal activity,'' said Dr. John Burrison, a curator at the Atlanta History Center.,Those in the ''death care industry,'' as it is known, are finding creative ways to attract people, in keeping with the prevailing wisdom that ''neglect begets neglect,'' as Ms. Winslow put it. Lovers of bass can now go fishing at Michigan Memorial Park in Huron Township, Mich. Others can enter contests like the one at Lake View where the prize was a four-star dinner for two at the James A. Garfield monument serenaded by the Ohio Chamber Orchestra.,But the boldest idea may be at the historic Congressional Cemetery in southwest Washington, where $100-a-year memberships for dogs have turned the 1807 cemetery into a 32-acre dog run that ''provides us with people in the cemetery all day long,'' said Susan Olsen, a board member of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery.,WITHIN the antiques world, laws that require dealers to report suspicious statuary are likely to remain controversial. ''If there are a billion tchotchkes in the world, only a fraction of them have been stolen,'' said John Sare, an attorney with Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy in New York, who represents museums and collectors. ''So it makes more sense to register thefts than objects.'',Right now the most secure cemetery artifact may well be Bird Girl, the bronze funerary cover girl of John Berendt's ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (Random House, 1994), who for generations watched over the Trosdal family at the Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Ga. An instant celebrity, the statue was removed for safe-keeping by descendants and now resides at the Telfair Museum of Art, where attendance has doubled since her arrival.",PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN,"FEB. 28, 1999",Ideas & Trends; Stolen From the Grave for the Garden,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-stolen-from-the-grave-for-the-garden.html
"WHEN Brian Dennehy took on the role of Willy Loman, the tragic hero of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' he wanted some new insight into the psychological makeup of a character that has been played thousands of times, and by some of the greatest actors of the century.,So Robert Falls, the director of the new Broadway production, sent the script to two psychiatrists.,''They both said the same thing,'' Mr. Falls recalled. ''They said that Willy was manic-depressive, with hallucinatory aspects.'',Could it be as simple as that? Willy Loman, a manic-depressive.,Ever since the play's debut in 1949, critics and academics have debated the symbolism of Mr. Miller's salesman: He is a stand-in for the long-suffering common man; a suicidal victim of the capitalist machine; nothing more than a man undone by his own ignorance and womanizing.,But what if he is none of these? What if he is really just a man struggling with a psychiatric condition that was poorly understood at the time the play was written?,''I think there's definitely people out there saying, 'I wonder what would have happened if Willy got some Ritalin, and maybe got some counseling to get into another line of work,' '' said Peter Kramer, a psychiatrist and the author of ''Listening to Prozac.'',Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright, said such an analysis could be applied to many great dramatic characters.,''I don't know why you'd limit it to Willy,'' she said. ''Heck, why don't you get Electra and Lear in there and get them some family counseling?'',It has always been true that the sensibilities of an era color the perception of works of art.,But sometimes the science of a later era suggests a new explanation for a central conflict in a work of literature, raising questions about the author's intention and speculation about whether the author's contribution is diminished.,Mr. Falls, who is also the artistic director of the Goodman Theater in Chicago, says that such speculation misses the point.,''I think that every work of art is filtered through the lens of people looking at it, and through whatever the timely issues are of the moment,'' he said. ''The  great works are the works that survive.'',And ''Death of Salesman'' has survived, having been produced and adapted around the world almost continuously for the last 50 years.,Theater artists, a famously sensitive breed, have always been susceptible to psychological and intellectual trends. Freud was a heavy influence in the development of acting in the early part of this century, informing classic performances like Laurence Olivier's interpretation of Oedipus during the 1940's.,In more recent years, experimental troupes like the Wooster Group in Manhattan have deconstructed Chekhov and Eugene O'Neill to within an inch of their lives.,The signs of the shift in conflict from the social to the psychological are rife in Mr. Falls's production of ''Death of a Salesman.'',Gone is the image -- created by the designer Jo Mielziner in 1949 -- of Willy's Brooklyn home wedged between apartment buildings. Today's set floats in and out of moody lighting described by Ben Brantley of The New York Times as having ''a sense of engulfing night that evokes William Styron's notion of emotional depression as 'darkness visible.' '',And while purists may grumble, reinterpreting the conflict seems to have struck a chord with today's audiences. The production has received some of the season's best reviews, with many critics saying it took Mr. Miller's flawed hero off a cold ideological plane.,''Death of a Salesman'' isn't the only classic getting a reinterpretation this season.,In Los Angeles, the playwright Jon Robin Baitz has written a new translation of Henrik Ibsen's ''Hedda Gabler,'' considered a feminist forerunner, that attempts to clarify her psychological motivations for her behavior. It will star Annette Bening.,Viewing Willy Loman through a prism of psychiatry, Mr. Falls said, is something of an oversimplification. But he acknowledged that the psychological approach has paid benefits. ''I actually think audiences take it more personally,'' Mr. Falls said. ''The socio-political stuff is definitely there, but it's hard to direct metaphor.'',Mr. Kramer, the psychiatrist, says there may be an unintended result of making Willy Loman's malady personal rather than societal.,''What looked like Everyman struggling with Everyman's challenges now only looks like a particular man with a particular problem,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''Instead of the audience saying, 'That's what happens to human beings when their history is laid bare,' I can imagine them saying, 'That's what happens when people with a propensity for late life attention deficit disorder reach that age.'',''It's not that I'm advocating a clinical lens,'' he concluded. ''I just think it's there.'',Ms. Wasserstein disagrees. ''Plays are still about conflict, still about families, about pain, and still about highs and lows,'' she said. ''Even if the audience is imagining different highs and lows, as long as there's pain out there, it's working.'',MR. MILLER was certainly mindful of the psychological core of the play: His original title was ''The Inside of His Head.'' But he has his own ideas about the diagnosis.,''Willy Loman is not a depressive,'' Mr. Miller said last week. ''He is weighed down by life. There are social reasons for why he is where he is.'',''I suppose if the audience were reacting in a clinical way, they would stand back and say, 'The guy needs a pill,' '' he said. ''But I hear people weeping. I don't think that could have happened if people were looking at it as a clinical experience.''",JESSE MCKINLEY,"FEB. 28, 1999",Ideas & Trends: Get That Man Some Prozac; If the Dramatic Tension Is All in His Head,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-get-that-man-some-prozac-if-the-dramatic-tension-is-all-in-his-head.html
"To the Editor:,Iver Peterson's characterization of Chuck Haytaian as a member of the Republican Party's ''conservative wing'' (''On Politics,'' Feb. 21) would be comical if it weren't being printed in a newspaper like The New York Times. Mr. Haytaian is anything other than conservative. As Assemblyman, Chuck Haytaian was a faithful cheerleader for Tom Kean's liberal fiscal policies that doubled state spending in just eight years while taxes skyrocketed. Mr. Haytaian spent much of his failed 1994 Senate campaign calling himself a ''Whitman Republican'' and abandoning the conservative voters he needed to win. As a result, those opposed to abortion, gun owners and others among the politically incorrect stayed home and Haytaian was one of the few Republicans nationwide to lose a competitive race.,As Christie Whitman's handpicked Republican state chairman, Chuck Haytaian serves as the enforcer for the Whitman ''big tent'' that keeps out anyone who believes strongly in core conservative principles. Serving as party spokesman, Mr. Haytaian regularly attacks conservatives and continues to defend the most extremely liberal Whitman big- government, big-spending policies.  Your characterization of Mr. Haytaian as a conservative shows how far out of touch your newspaper really is, particularly with the rank-and-file Republican primary voters who choose the party nominees.,RICK SHAFTAN,Sparta",,"FEB. 28, 1999",I Know Chuck Haytaian; He Is No Conservative,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/l-i-know-chuck-haytaian-he-is-no-conservative-516422.html
"Two weeks after he did not send a Valentine's Day card to his former manager, Todd Hundley delivered a message to him: Stay out of my life, and I'll be only too happy to stay out of yours.,Hundley, icing his right elbow in the Dodgers' spring training clubhouse today, heatedly spoke of his relationship with Bobby Valentine in the last two years of his tenure with the Mets. He said Valentine became too personal with him and was jealous of his popularity. Hundley also said the manager used him to deflect attention from other players and accused Valentine of leaking a story last summer about his allegedly having a drinking problem.,More recently, Hundley said, Valentine suggested that he was a bigot. In a cable television interview in December, Valentine, responding to a question, said Hundley blamed him for the Mets' acquisition of Mike Piazza. ''Todd does a lot of that Italian stuff,'' the manager said.,''He won't leave me alone,'' Hundley said after the Dodgers' workout, sitting on a trunk while talking to two reporters. ''Would you leave me alone already? Call me on the phone and talk to me. I'll meet you somewhere face to face. I'm going to try to meet him in a dark alley and talk to him about it.'',Valentine, 21 miles south at the Mets' complex in Port St. Lucie, declined to respond to Hundley's comments.,To say that Hundley and Valentine did not have a good relationship is an understatement. From Hundley's view, the problem began immediately when Valentine appeared, to him,  to be jealous of the player's standing with the fans. ''He comes into a whole new situation and goes right after I guess the most popular guy,'' Hundley said of Valentine. ''It's not my fault I'm the most popular guy.'',Hundley said that Valentine did not always like what he said, either. He recalled telling Valentine that he did not agree with his replacing Bernard Gilkey in the No. 3 spot in the batting order with John Olerud.,''I'm sure that added fuel to the fire,'' Hundley said. ''He'd say, 'I want to hear what you have to say,' but you tell him and he didn't like it. Then you were done. That's exactly the way it was. As stupid as I was, I fell for it.'',Their relationship really deteriorated during the 1997 season when Valentine said that Hundley did not get enough sleep, suggesting that he ran around too much at night.,''He came by my locker after he said that,'' Hundley said, ''and I said, 'What's going on here?' He said, 'I'm trying to get the headlines off this trade, take some pressure off Mel and Turk and Brian.' '',The Mets had traded Mark Clark, Lance Johnson and Manny Alexander for Mel Rojas, Turk Wendell and Brian McRae.,''He said, 'You're the leader of the team, you can handle it,' '' Hundley said. ''I said, 'You mean I'm taking one for the team?'  'Yeah, you can handle it.' I said: 'If you would have let me know ahead of time, I would have played along with you. But you got too personal now. War's on.' '',Hundley was particularly upset at the timing of Valentine's comments on his sleep habits, because his mother was being treated for cancer and his wife was pregnant.,''I'm talking to my mom while she's going through chemotherapy,'' Hundley said, ''and I'm helping my wife with taking care of our two kids and he's saying I'm out and about.'',The drinking stories surfaced last season. The comments about an alleged drinking problem, which came after the Mets obtained Piazza from the Marlins, were without attribution. ''That was a ploy to get me out of there and free the Mets to sign Mike,'' Hundley said, referring to Piazza.,Did Hundley believe that Valentine was the source of the stories, as other players had also suggested? ''Yeah,'' he said. ''It's not real tough to figure out. No one will put their name to it so factually I can't say it was him. That's the way he likes it. There's that little shadow of a doubt that he seems to always talk his way out of it. But I have an idea that he was the one.'',Asked how he felt about the treatment he received from Valentine, Hundley said, ''It just made me angry that he was trying to take a shot at ruining my reputation.'',He added: ''That's what I was angry about. I could have taken shots at his reputation, and I didn't. I could've brought up personal stuff that I know about him that no one else knows about him. I didn't. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to stoop that low.'',He said Valentine never fooled him with his comments.,''You see him coming from a mile away,'' he said. ''He thinks he's working in the shadows, but he's not. You can see right through him. I didn't have to remember what I said to who and keep track of all this other junk. I'm not going to lie. It seemed like he had to keep track of, I said this to this guy, this to this guy, this to this guy and he got caught up in his web. I don't spin many webs.'',Hundley, who said he loved New York and had no ill feeling toward anyone else in the Mets' organization, did credit Valentine with being an intelligent baseball man.,''He knows baseball,'' Hundley said. ''He came up with some different ideas that I had never heard of or seen and they worked.'',It was just their relationship that did not.",MURRAY CHASS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Hundley Says Valentine Should Keep Distance,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/hundley-says-valentine-should-keep-distance.html
"WESTCHESTER proceeded on two fronts last week to fight prejudice. As the county's executive branch announced the establishment of a Web site to lobby state officials for a hate-crimes law, the legislative branch held a public hearing on whether to install a human rights commission.,''There are just some fundamental things that are right,'' said George S. Latimer, Democrat of Rye and chairman of the Board of Legislators, one of several county and local government officials, Republicans and Democrats, who joined with the Westchester Coalition Against Bigotry at a news conference to urge local governments to press the state to adopt a hate-crimes law.,County Executive Andrew J. Spano said, ''It would seem this is a no-brainer.'',But while there was no acrimony at the news conference Monday morning, the Board of Legislators' hearing that evening was heated and about four hours long, in part because the proposal for a human rights commission would give the commission jurisdiction in the case of bias acts against homosexuals. Opponents of that idea, including representatives of the Archdiocese of New York and the Catholic Coalition, argued that it would imply an acceptance of homosexuality.,The Westchester Coalition was founded in 1995 to combat prejudice and work for a comprehensive hate-crimes bill in the state. Last year's brutal deaths of Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was apparently killed because he was gay, and James Byrd of Jasper, Tex., a black man who was dragged to his death apparently because of his race, have focused national attention on hate crimes. In New York state in 1997, 915 bias-related crimes were reported, according to the state's Office of Criminal Justice Services.,Derickson Lawrence, chairman of the Westchester Coalition, said the coalition created the Web site (www.wescab.org) to unite municipalities statewide in an effort to push for a hate-crimes law. He urged local governments to visit the site and adopt a resolution calling on the state to act on a hate-crimes bill. A number of local governments in Westchester have already passed such resolutions, including Ossining village, Greenburgh, the city of Rye, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and New Castle. Representatives of some of those communities as well as District Attorney Jeanine Pirro attended the news conference.,Hours later at the legislative hearing, many speakers voiced opposing views on whether homosexuals should be included under the umbrella of a county human rights commission. Such protection is not offered by state and Federal law.,As proposed, the commission, which could cost up to $1 million a year to run, would have the power to investigate discrimination complaints -- race, age, national origin, sex and sexuality -- and levy fines up to $10,000. The state has a Division of Human Rights, which would have  overlapping jurisdiction with a county human rights commission, as well as with commissions in some of the cities, including White Plains and Yonkers. but advocates of the new county agency say the human rights agency routinely takes four to seven years to handle a complaint.,Legislator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Democrat of Yonkers and the leading proponent of establishing the commission, said after the hearing:  ''There was clearly a contingent of people who were disaffected by the inclusion of protections for sexual orientation. Most of the speakers, however, understood the need for a human rights commission, even those who spoke against inclusion of sexual orientation.'' Ms. Stewart-Cousins rejected the idea of removing the sexual orientation provision, saying, ''We are creating a human rights commission that is to take us into the new millennium, and I think anything that gets created has to address the situation of its time.'',Paul J. Noto of Mamaroneck, the Republican minority leader on the  Board of Legislators, said the question of including sexual orientation was not an issue. He said his caucus was more concerned about the fiscal impact of creating a new commission.",DONNA GREENE,"FEB. 28, 1999",Human Rights Debated As Part of Commission,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/human-rights-debated-as-part-of-commission.html
"Today, Act II: In which Menifee, undefeated in two starts at 2, makes his debut at 3 as one of the top 10 candidates for the Kentucky Derby.,The big, strapping bay colt comes to Gulfstream Park by van from his training center at Payson Park, 90 miles to the north, and runs in the eighth race on a program of 12. It is a $34,000 allowance created to give a horse with the right connections a chance to run after a six-month layoff prompted by a bone chip in the right knee -- a deluxe debut in a season of great expectations.,And there is no sad twist in the story line at this point.,Menifee, looking strong and sleek and ranked the 1-2 favorite, broke slowly from the outside and took maybe half a mile while Pat Day was positioning him for the run that counts. They turned into the homestretch, moved up from fourth to second, challenged and passed Deputy Mac, drew relentlessly ahead in the final sixteenth of a mile and won by 2 1/2 lengths.,Three up, three down.,''He's smart,'' said Arthur Hancock, the son of the late Bull Hancock of Claiborne Farm, who owns the colt with Jimmy Stone, the New Orleans oil and gas executive.,''He's honest,'' said Stone. ''He's professional.'',He is also well bred, a son of Harlan and the mare Anne Campbell, and a grandson of the celebrated Storm Cat. And, Jimmy Stone pointed out, in his second start last summer, he outran both Cat Thief and Lemon Drop Kid, two of the stars of this year's Derby class.,Eliott Walden, who trains Menifee in a barn that includes Victory Gallop and Bet Me Best, said: ''The way the race looked on paper, I felt that, if he got beat, it would be because he beat himself. It's good to know that he is back.'',Menifee was back, all right. He flew through the seven furlongs in 1:222/5  after they raced the first half-mile in 443/5  seconds and three-quarters of a mile in 1:092/5 .,Hancock, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1982 with Gato del Sol and in 1989 with Sunday Silence, knows the agony and the ecstasy. He got a reminder last week when Harlan, the sire of Menifee, dropped dead in Kentucky.,''For me,'' he said, ''it's emotional because of Harlan. At 8:15 in the morning, I got a call from my wife in Kentucky telling me that the worst thing had happened: Harlan fell dead. But you have to think that in racing, the good follows the bad, so maybe this is an omen that Menifee will take his place.'',Walden was asked what was next for his prodigy, and replied: ''I won't bring him back in two weeks for the Florida Derby. We'll look at either the Tampa Bay Derby or maybe the Rebel Stakes or the Gotham, something on the weekend of March 20. Then, three weeks after that, the Blue Grass in Kentucky will be his final prep for the Kentucky Derby on May 1.'',Menifee was not alone on his comeback day at the races. In two other allowances, other bright 3-year-old colts also made their 1999 debuts: Shug McGaughey's Treasure Island, who had not raced since last July, and, one race later, Scotty Schulhofer's Lemon Drop Kid, who had not raced since running fifth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November.,In the usual manner of Derby hopefuls, their results were mixed. Treasure Island, a son of Danzig and grandson of Northern Dancer, never got untracked and finished fifth. Lemon Drop Kid, after wasting some ground trying to jump over shadows on the track, straightened out and finished strongly, 3 1/2 lengths in front of Cryptodiplomacy. He ran the mile and a sixteenth in 1:443/5 .,''He showed me what I thought he was -- a good horse,'' Schulhofer said, and then aimed his horse for the herd of hopefuls headed for Kentucky. ''Next?

"PINE is a light-colored, soft wood with a medium texture and closed grain. Easy to work and less expensive than most hardwoods, it is the wood most often used by do-it-yourselfers to make shelves and furniture. It is also commonly used to manufacture unfinished furniture. Although pine is easy to cut and shape, it can be difficult to finish because it is easily scratched and dented and tends to soak up finishes.,Before applying any finish, it is essential to carefully sand the wood to remove all scratches and create a smooth surface. Start with a medium-grit paper (80 to 100) aluminum oxide paper, then progress to finer grits (120 to 150) before smoothing with a 180-grit paper (Some stains require sanding with even finer grits. Read the label on the product for recommendations.). Always sand with the grain.,A good finishing job requires sanding the entire surface evenly without missing any spots. A common mistake that many do-it-yourselfers make is sanding the center of the surface and neglecting the edges. This creates a dished surface with high spots around the edges. To avoid this, try drawing a series of light pencil lines across the entire surface. Next, sand the lines away. If some disappear while others remain, it is an indication that you are not sanding evenly.,You can use a power sander, but work carefully because it can quickly cut into the soft wood. Also keep in mind that most power sanders do not operate in a strict linear, that is back and forth, motion. Orbital and vibrating sanders move the sanding pad in a roughly circular pattern that leaves tiny scratches across the grain.,For this reason many cabinetmakers and craftsmen prefer to finish the smoothing by hand-sanding. Always use a sanding block when hand-sanding a flat surface. Without the block, the paper can quickly cut into the softer sections of the wood, creating valleys and ripples.,Dent removal calls for a different technique. Place one or two drops of water in the dent and cover it with a damp cloth. Wait a few minutes to allow the drops to penetrate, then place the tip of a hot iron (set on ''cotton'') on the cloth. The heat from the iron will turn the water into steam, swell the fibers and raise the dent. For deep dents, you may have to repeat this trick two or three times.,The next step is to remove all the residual surface dust. This is called ''tacking,'' and is done by wiping the wood with a special cloth called a tack cloth. Tack cloths are available a paint stores and home centers. You can also make your own. To make a tack cloth, soak a clean piece of white cotton fabric in water, then wring it out. Wet it lightly with turpentine then dribble varnish freely over the cloth. Roll the cloth to wring out the water and distribute the varnish and turpentine throughout the fabric. A properly made tack cloth will be sticky enough to pick up dust without leaving moisture behind.,Before applying any finish, wipe the surface with mineral spirits or turpentine. This will reveal any dents that or scratches that you may have missed while sanding. Focus a bright spotlight across the surface and examine it carefully for defects. If the surface is clear, you can apply the finish.,Staining pine can be frustrating because it sucks up the color a different rates creating a motley surface. For this reason, pine is often called a ''blotch-prone wood.'' Many woodworkers avoid this problem by not using any stain. They simply apply a clear finish, like polyurethane.,If you want to stain, it's best to apply a sealer first. Sealers are brush-on liquids that penetrate into the wood to limit the amount of absorption. It is difficult to tell how much sealer should be used because different products produce different results. The end grain of boards is particularly absorbent and may need a few coats of sealer so the end matches the surface color.,To be on the safe side, test the sealer and stain on some scrap wood or on an inconspicuous part of the finished piece. The sealer will make the wood less absorbent and the color will be lighter than indicated on the can. You can either apply additional coats of stain or switch to a darker hue. After applying the stain, let it dry for at 24 hours before applying the final finish.,Pine accepts clear finishes like varnish or polyurethane much like any other wood. Read the label on the can and apply according to the directions. First, however, seal any knots in the wood with a coat of clear shellac; this will keep pigments in the knots from bleeding into the finish.",EDWARD R. LIPINSKI,"FEB. 28, 1999",HOME CLINIC; Pine: An Easy Wood That's Difficult to Finish,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/home-clinic-pine-an-easy-wood-that-s-difficult-to-finish.html
"Elia Kazan is a wonderfully creative director who has contributed brilliantly to the arts of drama and film in the 20th century. He is also a man who in 1952 gave the House Committee on Un-American Activities the names of people he had known during his brief membership in the Communist Party 16 years before. And he is a man whose impending recognition by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is driving some people into orgies of self-righteous frenzy. Mr. Kazan, they say, is a scoundrel who should apologize for past misdeeds in politics before he receives an honorary Oscar for his lifetime achievement in the arts.,Mr. Kazan, the protesters say, is an informer, and his offense is unforgivable. But is that what the protesters really mean? Is informing unforgivable in all circumstances? Had Mr. Kazan been a member of the German-American Bund naming underground Nazis, would they have condemned him just as much? Or a former Klansman who informed on his hooded brethren? Or a former Mafia thug who informed on the mob? Or a member of the Nixon White House who informed during Watergate? Or a whistleblower who disclosed government malfeasance?  No, informing per se is not Mr. Kazan's offense. His true offense in the minds of the Hollywood protesters is that he informed on the Communist Party.,Now, informing on former associates is not an easy choice, even though Mr. Kazan named no names not already known to the committee. Under the pressure of the time, Mr. Kazan searched his conscience and went one way. Others searched their consciences and went another way. Those who were not subject to the pressures of the time should not rush to judgment. ''No one knows what he'd do,'' Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors Studio, told Mr. Kazan, ''until he's in it.'',Mr. Kazan's critics are those -- or latter-day admirers of those -- who continued to defend Stalin after the Moscow trials, after the pact with Hitler, through the age of the gulag. One wonders at their presumption in condemning others for recognizing the horrors of Stalinism -- horrors that the entire world, including Russia, acknowledges today.,The presumption is especially acute when it comes from those who, when they testified before HUAC, declined to declare their true beliefs. (Bartley Crum, one of their lawyers, urged that they declare them.) Instead they preserved secrecy, refused to argue their beliefs and posed as champions of a Bill of Rights that a Stalinist regime would instantly have abolished. If the Academy's occasion calls for apologies, let Mr. Kazan's denouncers apologize for the aid and comfort they gave to Stalinism.,Those were horrid times. Little has disgraced Congress more than the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Its inquiry into Communism in Hollywood was among the most indefensible, scandalous and cruel episodes in the entire history of legislative investigations. The idea that the presence of a few Stalinists and fellow-travelers in the film industry was a grave threat to the republic rates high in the annals of Congressional asininity. Collaboration with these Congressional clowns had its elements of disgust and shame, as Mr. Kazan himself admits in his memoir.,But was it worse than collaboration with the Communist Party -- the party that for years, as Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in 1945, ''taught the philosophy of the lie.'',''They taught that allegiance to the party and acceptance of orders from party heads, whose interests were not just those of the United States, were paramount'' she said. ''Because I have experienced the deception of the American Communists, I will not trust them.'',These were indeed horrid years -- horrid for HUAC's unhappy targets, horrid for HUAC's unhappy collaborators. In 1970 Dalton Trumbo, a major target, spoke interesting words to the Screenwriters Guild.,''Caught in a situation that had passed beyond the control of mere individuals,'' he said, ''each person reacted as his nature, his needs, his convictions and his particular circumstances compelled him to. There was bad faith and good, honesty and dishonesty, courage and cowardice, selflessness and opportunism, wisdom and stupidity, good and bad on both sides.'',Mr. Trumbo concluded: ''When you who are in your 40's or younger look back with curiosity on that dark time, as I think occasionally you should, it will do no good to search for villains or heroes or saints or devils because there were none; there were only victims.''",ARTHUR SCHLESINGER JR.,"FEB. 28, 1999",Hollywood Hypocrisy,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/opinion/hollywood-hypocrisy.html
"For every game that Tommy Salo has blown this season, there is a game like tonight's, when the Islanders' goalie steals 2 points for his team.,Facing the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings tonight, Salo was everything, and everywhere, he wasn't during Thursday night's loss to the Maple Leafs. The Red Wings fired 36 shots at him, from every angle, and on all but one of them Salo was there with a glove, a leg pad or askate.,Playing his best hockey of the season, the goalie led the Islanders to a 3-1 victory in front of 13,243 fans at Nassau Coliseum.,''Anytime he is making big saves like that, the team feeds off it,'' defenseman Rich Pilon said. ''When he lets in the easy ones, it affects the whole team. We need him to play like that every night.'',The Islanders (19-35-7) took a 2-1 lead into the third period, but the victory was not sealed until Mark Lawrence scored a power-play goal with five minutes left. The Islanders avoided a tie moments before Lawrence's goal as the Red Wings (31-25-6) had a score by Kris Draper disallowed because his skate was in Salo's crease. The Islanders also survived a scare when defenseman Zdeno Chara was knocked to the ice by a vicious slash by Sergei Fedorov. Although he was briefly knocked unconscious, Chara was not seriously injured. The penalty to Fedorov led to the Islanders' final power-play goal.,After allowing two weak goals in Thursday's 4-1 loss to Toronto, Salo redeemed himself tonight. Salo made perhaps his biggest stops in the opening 20 minutes, the best coming against Darren McCarty, who received a slick pass from Vyacheslav Kozlov. Salo thwarted the 2-on-1 chance, stuffing McCarty with his leg pad.,''It was nice to come back the way I did tonight,'' said Salo, who had 35 saves. ''The defense played good in front of me tonight. I was seeing the puck.'',Robert Reichel was the first Islander to beat Detroit's Kevin Hodson, who faced 30 shots, stopping 27. Reichel scored on an assist from Zigmund Palffy on the power play 43 seconds into the second period to give the Islanders a 1-0 lead. Standing on Hodson's door step, Reichel redirected a Palffy pass.,Barry Richter made it 2-0 at 5 minutes 36 seconds, shooting a long rebound past Hodson from the middle of the left circle.,The Red Wings' only goal was scored by Tomas Holstrom late in the second period.,''I think we have potential,'' Islanders Coach Bill Stewart said. ''But potential is a scary word in professional sports.'',''If we don't get consistency,'' he added, ''like all good teams have, you're going to have an up-and-down season, and you're going to miss the playoffs.'',Despite a concussion and mild whiplash, Stewart stood behind his team's bench tonight. On Friday, he was on his way to the Islanders' practice at Iceworks in Syosset, N.Y., when his pickup truck was sideswiped by a dump truck. Stewart's head hit the windshield and the roof of his truck. Stewart said he was merely sending a message to his team.,Asked how his head was feeling today, Stewart said, joking: ''There's always a headache when you're the 25th team in the league.'',SLAP SHOTS,SERGEI FEDOROV of the Red Wings received a match penalty in the third period Saturday night and thus is suspended until the National Hockey League reviews his slash to the neck of Islanders defenseman ZDENO CHARA. Chara was unconscious for several seconds, but except for a welt on the side of his neck, he did not appear to be seriously injured. ''I don't know what he was thinking,'' said Chara, who had knocked down Fedorov moments before the incident. ''What he did had nothing to do with the game.'' Fedorov said: ''I tried to get up and the stick just got him. I tried to recover my position. I thought the puck was underneath me, so I was moving quickly. I'm sorry, I did not mean for him to get hurt.'',As the March 23 trade deadline approaches, the Islanders might dump salary by trading away high-priced free agents-to-be.

"Sometimes, when the Flyers' bus rumbles through the Lincoln Tunnel and emerges into the bustle of Manhattan, Eric Lindros sits back, looks out the window and wonders what it might have been like to live and work here instead of in Philadelphia. What if the Quebec Nordiques' owner, Marcel Aubut, had been more adroit or if the arbitrator Larry Bertuzzi had decided differently?,Instead of joining the Philadelphia Flyers seven seasons ago, Lindros would have become a Ranger. He would have been understudy to Mark Messier, a man he admired and emulated. Wearing the big 88 on his blue, red and white Rangers jersey instead of the orange, white and black of the Flyers, Lindros could have been a key performer on a New York team contending, maybe even this season, for the Stanley Cup.,In the Flyers' media guide, atop his biography, Lindros lists Madison Square Garden as his favorite National Hockey League rink and New York as his favorite N.H.L. city. But this is not to suggest that Lindros is not satisfied or motivated with his current team, once again a top contender for the Stanley Cup and on display today at the Garden against the Rangers.,Today happens to be Lindros's 26th birthday, but in some ways he seems older. He has been a hockey celebrity since age 16, and he has experienced plenty of strife.,Because Aubut and the Nordiques traded Lindros to the Rangers and the Flyers on the same day in June 1992, Bertuzzi had to choose between the two teams. He favored Philadelphia. The multiplayer, multimillion-dollar deal sent Peter Forsberg to the Nordiques, who later moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. Forsberg became one of the world's best players and helped the Avalanche to the 1996 Stanley Cup. They might contend this season.,Lindros, wearing the captain's ''C,'' helped the Flyers to the 1997 finals, where they lost in four games to Detroit. Although they have been slumping slightly, the Flyers are still among the top Eastern Conference teams.,Should the Flyers finally win the Stanley Cup, the critics will say Lindros at last proved himself, in his seventh season, the way Wayne Gretzky did in his fifth with Edmonton, the way Mario Lemieux did in his seventh with Pittsburgh. Should they fall short, people will murmur that Lindros has never quite lived up to expectations. They will question his leadership and his inspirational qualities, exactly as they did last winter when he captained a good Team Canada to a disappointing fourth-place finish in the Olympics. Even Bob Clarke, the Philadelphia general manager, hinted before this season that Lindros needs to take his team further and show he deserves to be one of the highest-paid athletes in his profession.,''I play the same from year to year, no matter what is said,'' Lindros said of Clarke's comments. ''Everybody deals with pressure in different ways. He can say what he wants to say and he has the right to go out and voice what he wants.'',Lindros also spent last summer talking, somewhat less publicly than Clarke. He was embarrassed that the Flyers were eliminated in the first round by Buffalo in five games. After discussing his ideas for the team with Clarke, Lindros was not happy with the way the general manager responded. At his cottage in Ontario, Lindros visited frequently with Steve Yzerman, the captain of the Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings. And he had another meeting, a positive one, with Roger Neilson, the Flyers' coach, perhaps the coach with whom Lindros has felt most comfortable.,Earning $8.5 million this season in the last year of his contract, Lindros could become a restricted free agent this summer. However, he and his father, Carl Lindros, who serves as his agent, have what Carl Lindros says is a verbal agreement to play next season with Philadelphia -- providing Clarke does not trade him, as Clarke, last summer, implied he might. But is a verbal contract recognized by the N.H.L.?,''No,'' Carl Lindros said.,Should Eric Lindros allow bids for his services, he could move to another team, perhaps a wealthy team like the Rangers, for much more money. A team would have to compensate the Flyers with five first-round draft choices if the Flyers did not match its offer to Lindros. The Rangers were willing to give that up for a lesser player, Joe Sakic of Colorado, two years ago. But Carl Lindros said he and his son have a nonwritten understanding with the Flyers, just as they did after Aubut gave the Flyers permission to talk to the family on that day of two trades in 1992.,So they intend to honor it, Carl Lindros said, again for $8.5 million, plus several large bonuses involving personal achievements in the current season. One of those bonuses concerns the Hart trophy for most valuable player, which Lindros won in 1995.,Although the buzz in recent weeks has been that Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr could win the Hart, a Lindros booster could make a good case, and a strong fourth quarter of the season could change the handicapping. Jagr leads the National Hockey League with 89 points, but Lindros is in second place with 83. Jagr has 28 goals, but Lindros has 35, only 2 behind John LeClair, his linemate, who leads the league with 37. As a tandem, Lindros and LeClair are to the Flyers what Mantle and Maris were to the Yankees. They are together most on the ice, not off.,''We're close, but we've got different things going,'' Lindros said. ''He's married with a couple of kids and I'm single.'' Lindros lives, he said, ''about a 7-iron away'' from LeClair. Six other teammates have homes in the same housing complex. ''Our group is pretty close,'' Lindros said.,Perhaps, but Lindros has always projected a certain apartness, as well as an aura of danger. As a teen-ager, he resisted Canada's feudal junior system and forced a trade to a team near his Toronto home. Before turning pro, he resisted the N.H.L.'s draft, stayed amateur for a year, and forced Quebec to trade him. A large man who plays a collision-based style, Lindros has suffered two concussions, one severe, and has caused a few. His frightening devastation of Ottawa's Andreas Dackell early this season -- unpenalized and resulting in no suspension -- had to send a chill down spines in 26 opposing rinks.,''It was a clean hit,'' Lindros said of the crunching check into the boards that left Dackell bloody and dazed. ''I give and take hits a lot.,''I don't wish harm on anybody,'' Lindros said. ''I don't wish injury on anybody. I've been hurt more than most.'',Once was last year, when Pittsburgh's Darius Kasparaitis hit him. ''One of the stupidest mistakes I've ever made was trying to carry the puck with my head down,'' Lindros said, and it left him ''in la-la land'' for more than a month.,Although Lindros has an aggressive, scary side in competition, he also has a humanitarian instinct. He has been honored for his work with the Children's Miracle Network, which provides hospitalization for children with long-term illnesses.,On the ice, his concerns are less serious and more upbeat. On his right wing, the arrival of Keith Jones had made the Lindros-LeClair unit a better line. The return of Mikael Renberg and the acquisition of Daymond Langkow have improved the other forward units. In goal, John Vanbiesbrouck has made it a better team.,''To the organization's credit, they've really renewed the team with a lot of new blood,'' Lindros said. ''There's a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for us.''",JOE LAPOINTE,"FEB. 28, 1999","HOCKEY; Lindros Up Front in Bus, but Team Waits for Him to Take Wheel",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/hockey-lindros-up-front-in-bus-but-team-waits-for-him-to-take-wheel.html
"There were two lockers that were full of equipment left intact at the Rangers' practice here today, those belonging to Wayne Gretzky and John MacLean.,There was no surprise about the absence of Gretzky, who missed his first game as a member of the Rangers on Friday with a bulging disk in his neck that will sideline him for at least two weeks.,But where was MacLean? He scored the last two goals in Friday night's 3-0 victory over Phoenix, which Gretzky watched from a luxury box above the Madison Square Garden ice.,Unfortunately, MacLean may be aching in the same area as Gretzky, who missed his first game after playing 223 in a row for the Rangers. MacLean had a magnetic resonance imaging test on his neck this afternoon. The test did not reveal anything wrong, and he is expected to play against Philadelphia on Sunday.,But pain in his neck has forced MacLean to miss practices in recent weeks, though he has not missed any games, just as Gretzky did not before Friday night despite being in pain for months.,Coach John Muckler tried to explain MacLean's ailment. ''He has spasms up here,'' Muckler said, pointing to his neck, ''and he missed practice for precautionary reasons.'',Meanwhile, the Rangers were adjusting to life without Gretzky. Muckler said today that his team would have to change its style, paying more attention to defense before creating offense.,The Rangers emphasized defense before creating offense in the victory over Phoenix on Friday night, and Muckler was extremely pleased with the results.,''This may be the greatest job of the year for us,'' Muckler said of the victory.,Muckler would not say that Sunday's clash with the Flyers would be the strongest test of character yet for his team, but he admitted that Eric Lindros and John LeClair would present a huge problem because ''they're the best in the business down low.'',Muckler said Petr Nedved would shoulder most of the responsibility of playing against Lindros, but the defensemen who match up against Lindros are as important. Muckler indicated Brian Leetch and Ulf Samuelsson would be the defensemen going against Lindros and his line.",ALEX YANNIS,"FEB. 28, 1999",HOCKEY; Both MacLean And Gretzky Are Hurting,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/hockey-both-maclean-and-gretzky-are-hurting.html
"Drivers whose cars are seized under the Giuliani administration's new crackdown on drunken driving face such a long and costly series of criminal and civil court battles to get their vehicles back that many may simply decide to give up their cars without a fight, defense lawyers said last week.,They predicted that a first-time offender whose blood alcohol level is just over the legal limit -- drivers comprising about half of the 4,978 people charged with driving drunk last year -- could expect to lose the car, pay at least a $300 fine and have their license suspended for at least 90 days.,If they are lucky, such drivers could eventually buy back their cars from the Police Department at their approximate trade-in value, the lawyers said.,A majority of seized cars are sold back to defendants in drug and prostitution cases, a police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. Selling the cars back is not official policy in cases of drunken driving, but defense lawyers and civil-court officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said it was likely to be an option offered to some first-time offenders, particularly if a case is weak or a car is co-owned by an uninvolved third party. Settling cases this way, they said, would be cheaper and easier for the city.,Drivers who test far above the legal limit or are second-time offenders who choose to fight the charges can expect to be mired in risky criminal and civil court battles for more than a year, pay up to $10,000 in legal fees, and lose their cars anyway. The lawyers said that these drivers may find it easier just to plead guilty and surrender their cars.,Once an arrest for drunken driving is made and a car is seized, two processes begin: the criminal case against the driver and the city's civil case to take the car.,The crackdown is barely a week old and it is still unclear how it will play out among drivers, their lawyers, police officers and officials in the city's overburdened court system if it withstands constitutional challenges. Some predict an explosion in the number of drivers who demand trials, a move that could cripple the courts and make the crackdown enormously expensive. But others predict that nearly all drivers will simply give up on getting their cars back.,But the most likely scenario, according to defense lawyers, prosecutors and court officials, is that a two-tiered system will develop. Wealthy first-time offenders who are willing and able to fight may be able to quickly settle the criminal charge and the civil case by buying their cars back from the police. But repeat offenders and the poor will lack the resources to fight a drawn-out battle and will in essence be forced to give them up. While in criminal court  defendants who cannot afford lawyers are represented by court-appointed lawyers, in civil court they are on their own.,Mitchell C. Ellman, a lawyer who specializes in drunken driving cases, said the city faces enormous court costs if drivers fight and the crackdown is carried out as strictly as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has outlined. Mr. Ellman and civil court officials who spoke on condition of anonymity predicted that the city would allow some defendants to settle their civil cases, in essence, by buying their cars back.,''The city is going to have to plea bargain on the civil side,'' he said. ''If even 20 percent of drunk drivers went to trial you're talking about 1,000 cases. The city does not have the capability to do it.'',But city officials say they have the resources to carry out the crackdown, cars will be taken away from first-time offenders and they are not bluffing. ''The harm a first-time offender can do on the road is the same as a second-time offender,'' said Daniel S. Connolly, a special counsel in the city Law Department.,For those accused of driving  drunk, the problems begin with a  choice after being pulled over. If the driver refuses to take a breath test, the driver's license is automatically suspended for six months. And even drivers who do not take a test can be charged with driving drunk and lose their cars based on how a police officer assesses their behavior.,If the driver takes the test, a blood-alcohol reading of 0.10 or higher will trigger his or her arrest and the seizure of the car. A lower score can lead to an arrest for driving while impaired, a traffic infraction, but not the loss of the car. After a night in jail, the driver will appear before a judge, be arraigned and likely told to return to court in a month.,Defense lawyers said they would counsel clients to first resolve their criminal cases. In one of the few pieces of relatively good news for offenders, officials in District Attorney's offices in all five boroughs this week said that prosecutors were in essence taking no position on the crackdown and would continue to offer plea bargains where merited in drunken driving cases.,Prosecutors in Brooklyn and the Bronx currently allow first-time offenders who are not involved in accidents and test at .15 or lower to plead to the lesser charge of driving while impaired, a traffic infraction that carries a $300 fine an 90-day license suspension. In Manhattan and Staten Island, drivers are allowed to plead to the lesser charge if they test below .12 or .13. Queens prosecutors said they evaluate each defendant on a case-by-case basis.,Last year, roughly half of the 4,978 people charged with drunken driving in the city were allowed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of driving while impaired, according to court records. But Giuliani administration officials said they would still move to seize the cars of people who avoid conviction on drunken driving charges by pleading guilty to the lesser charge of driving while impaired.,Defense lawyers were split over whether they would advise their clients to take the plea or demand a trial in the criminal case. Some said any guilty plea would bolster the city's case in civil court that the car should be seized. But others said it was more practical to take the guilty plea and hope the city allows first-time offenders to buy their cars back.,The police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the majority of the 1,800 cars seized last year in drug, prostitution and driving without a license cases ended in ''settlements,'' in which the defendants bought their cars back. The police official said that the Police Department goes to trial in civil court over car seizures in less than 1 percent of cases. In the vast majority of cases either the defendant gives up the car or the police agree to a settlement.,Court officials who spoke on condition of anonymity and defense lawyers said the city could adopt a zero tolerance policy, but the cost would be enormous. The problem for the city is not storing the cars, they said, it is the cost of fully litigating the lengthy civil cases where drivers fight them. Under a zero tolerance drunk driving crackdown, the number of civil actions involving cars filed by the city could triple from 1,800 last year to nearly 7,000 cases.,For now, most of the 23 drivers who have had their cars seized appear to be waiting to see if the practice is declared unconstitutional. As of Friday, only one driver, Pavel Grinberg, had filed a letter demanding the return of his car. Mr. Grinberg, a first-time offender who tested just over the legal limit during the first night of the crackdown, is the test case the New York Civil Liberties Union hopes to use get the crackdown declared illegal. Mr. Grinberg's lawyers are expected to demand a court order barring further seizures.",DAVID ROHDE,"FEB. 28, 1999",The High Price of Drunken Driving Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/the-high-price-of-drunken-driving-law.html
"JAMES KAVOURIAS says he grew up ''dirt poor'' in Manhattan, the son of a Greek immigrant and a second-generation Greek-American who worked long hours running a diner in the West 50's. They lived in rent-controlled apartments, first in Harlem and then in Washington Heights.,Eventually, he became a contractor, and then the owner of a hardware store. Over the years, he did a number of jobs in town houses, restoring down-at-the-heels structures to their former elegance.,One job in Greenwich Village lasted three years and showed him the intricacies of 19th-century construction -- and the potential for appreciation in real estate. It gave him the lust for a house of his own. Like his parents, he had always lived in apartments in the city, most recently on the Lower East Side. ''I never paid more than $400 to live in my life,'' he says.,A few years ago, he tried to buy a building with 10 apartments in Chelsea but fell $28,000 short of getting the financing he needed. Still, the idea wouldn't let go. He was always looking.,About a year ago, walking in the western part of Chelsea, he noticed a  four-story town house on West 24th Street near 10th Avenue with a ''For Sale'' sign on it and a Greek name -- the broker was Charles Sciberras, from Remax Today in Astoria, Queens. When he called, Mr. Sciberras told him to go to an open house.,He did -- and so did 80 other people, he says, including Deborah Harry, the singer. Any sane amateur would have been scared off by the ramshackle house. Calling it a wreck would be too high a compliment. It showed every day of its 152 years.,A six-foot extension on the back wasn't properly attached and would have to be torn down. A rent-controlled tenant was living on the top floor, so the buyer of the house, which measures 20 feet wide by 43 feet deep, would have only three floors for personal use. Still, the asking price was $899,000, and in Manhattan, any house selling for less than $1 million brings a lot of interest.,So, playing the Greek card, Mr. Kavourias, who is 46, went up to the broker and said -- in Greek, naturally -- ''What do you think it would take for this deal to work?'' Mr. Sciberras said it would take $700,000.,So Mr. Kavourias bid that, and he won.,Next came the hard part. The financing took months to work out, because he could put down only $150,000 in cash, and the $550,000 loan fell into the nonconforming category -- loans so large they do not get bought and sold in the secondary market and thus carry more risk for the bank underwriting them.,THIS time, though, he was luckier with financing, because through friends he had met Warren Perkins, an assistant manager at Republic Bank. Mr. Kavourias showed his good faith by moving his other accounts to the bank. The bank could see that he was creditworthy, and that two floors of market-rate rentals in the building would provide income of $4,200 a month. And the house was appraised at $825,000.,Finally, in September, he closed, and almost immediately began renovations. He guesses he can redo three floors for $200,000, which is much less than someone not in the business could manage. He is using a contractor but is buying all the material himself, and working in the building on weekends.,He has also found out what it's like to be on the other side, to be the customer. ''I could never do to somebody what I'm seeing here,'' he says. When the building's third story was being gutted, a plumber, apparently thinking that the whole building was unsalvageable, threw a huge radiator down the stairs, smashing part of the staircase, one of the few original details remaining in the house. Mr. Kavourias was horrified, broken-hearted and furious. ''That's the last we saw that guy,'' he says.,By mid-January, the third floor was redone with a new white kitchen with wood cabinets, a new bath, new oak floors and new windows. Basically the only thing that remains is the marble mantel over a fireplace that will eventually be outfitted with gas.,Some friends moved in, probably paying less than market value. But they will have to put up with dust and noise for a year while the work on the building is finished. Mr. Kavourias is planning a deck off the third-story apartment, and a Japanese garden in the yard with a pond for koi fish and a hot tub.,The ground floor, also destined to be rented by a friend, is being finished now, and work is progressing on Mr. Kavourias's space, the parlor floor, where he has built a new legal extension with a bedroom and kitchen. In six weeks, Mr. Kavourias should be living in his new home.,Even when the work is done, he expects to keep renting to friends. The building will be his home, but it also represents a place to have a community, to be with the new friends he has made after devastating years that saw his lover and many of his friends die of AIDS.,When he first bought it, the whole building shook if you jumped, because wooden beams had rotted, and some had even been cut, to make room in the basement for a boiler. Now steel girders stabilize the building.,''I've been trying to buy something like this house my whole life,'' he says. ''It's everything I ever wanted.''",TRISH HALL,"FEB. 28, 1999",Habitats / Chelsea; Buying a Town House To Fulfill a Dream,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/habitats-chelsea-buying-a-town-house-to-fulfill-a-dream.html
"Little by little, Jeanette Antolin's quest to make it onto next year's United States Olympic gymnastics team is gaining momentum. She has already achieved her goal for this year -- making it onto the Pan American team -- and a recent performance earned her an unexpected invitation to the American Cup next weekend in St. Petersburg, Fla., the biggest international meet in the United States and an event in which she will compete against top international gymnasts.,With a year and a half left before the Sydney Olympics, where many Americans may focus on Vanessa Atler, the 1997 co-national champion, and Kristen Maloney, the current national champion, Antolin will quietly continue her journey. She hopes to maintain or improve her sixth-place national ranking. Only the top seven gymnasts make the Olympic team.,For Antolin, 17, of Paradise, Calif., being the underdog and competing in someone else's shadow is nothing new. For a decade that shadow belonged to her older sister, Katie.,The two, who are 16 months apart, spent almost 11 years training together and even competed for the United States at a meet in France in 1993. While most of the attention was focused on Katie, who was competing at the elite level at 13, Jeanette did not become jealous. She instead became more motivated. ''It's not that I wanted to beat her, I just wanted to get to her level,'' she said.,Katie Antolin never made it to the national team and stopped competing for a few years after coming down with chronic back pain. Her younger sister then began to shine, most recently at the Pan Am trials on Feb. 14 in Pomona, Calif., where she finished fourth.,As Katie watches Jeanette progress, there is sheer admiration instead of bitterness.,''She definitely deserves to be in the place that she's in right now,'' said Katie, 18, who knows firsthand how hard it is to train at a world-class level. The older Antolin, who has resumed competing, is attending Cal State-Fullerton on a full athletic scholarship, even though she competes only on bars.,What makes Jeanette Antolin's gymnastics unique is her combination of ''flexibility and elegance mixed with strength and power,'' said her coach, Don Peters. He coached five members of the 1984 Olympic team and came out of retirement as exclusive coach for Antolin.,Peters says his pupil is among the top gymnasts because she enjoys competing.,''While other gymnasts say, 'Darn, it's my turn,' Jeanette sees the green flag is up and says, 'Good, it's my turn,' '' said Peters, who was the national and Olympic team coach from 1980 to 1988.,At 2, Katie Antolin was enrolled in recreational classes that Jeanette later joined. What began as a hobby for the sisters soon became their life's passion. With the girls quickly advancing beyond the recreational level and with coaches telling their parents the girls had a shot at some day going to the Olympics, it was clear to Nola and Orlando Antolin that they had to give their daughters a chance.,Achieving this level of skill has been a family effort for the Antolins, who in 1991 moved from Paradise to Huntington Beach, Calif., nine hours away, so their daughters could train at the Scats gym, where the Pan Am trials were held.,It's a decision they have yet to regret, said Nola Antolin.,''It's been good for them,'' she said. ''They've done good in school. They can use the skills they've learned in their lives. They've done lots of traveling and met a lot of people.'',But being able to afford their daughters' gymnastics lessons and traveling expenses has never been easy for the Antolins, who are now divorced. From Day 1, Nola Antolin, who has a full-time job as a secretary at a public school, has also worked part-time at Scats to help defray costs of training there, and family members have helped out when times got especially tough. Once Jeanette made the national team, in 1995, the United States Gymnastics Federation began paying for her training costs, but there are still traveling expenses to consider.,While there was a time when the entire family -- including 21-year-old brother Gilbert -- could watch all of Antolin's competitions, that does not happen anymore because her competitions are now mostly in Europe. At the Pan Am trials two weeks ago, which were held on the campus of California Polytechnic State University in Pomona, Antolin felt lucky to have her own cheering section filled with family, friends and teammates.,Antolin has also attracted the attention of all the little girls in her gym and has finally become used to their running out and buying the same leotard she bought the day before in the gym's pro shop. Not only does she enjoy getting the attention (''I love being somebody everyone looks up to,'' she said), she also enjoys giving her fans attention.,''She'll sign autographs after meets until her hands cramp,'' Peters said. Could Antolin be signing the word Olympian beside her name? Her family and friends think so.,''I look at her and say, 'We're this close,' '' her father said.,While that distance was once measured by the space between his outstretched hands, now it's marked by the space between his fingers.",NANCY GAVILANES,"FEB. 28, 1999",GYMNASTICS; Many Small Steps Toward a Big Dream,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/gymnastics-many-small-steps-toward-a-big-dream.html
"In the annals of recent Latin American brutality, no nation can match Guatemala. The civil war that ended in 1996 went on for 36 years and killed hundreds of thousands, the vast majority of them Mayan civilians. Now the country's truth commission, known as the Commission for Historical Clarification, has issued a report whose unflinching description of what happened captures the scale of Guatemala's tragedy. It is up to Guatemala's Government to show that the country has indeed changed, by embracing the report and moving quickly to carry out its recommendations.,The truth commission was sponsored by the United Nations. Its conclusions are numbing. The commission believes that more than 200,000 people were killed, more than 90 percent of them by Government forces. Some of the state's counterinsurgency operations, the commission concludes, could be characterized as genocide. The report dismisses the military's claim that the massacres were the excesses of rogue soldiers and instead finds an ''extermination en masse of defenseless Mayan communities,'' directed from the very top. The state, the report concludes, had become an instrument to protect a racist and unjust economic order.,This is blunter language than usually found in U.N. documents, but there is no doubt of its truth. The report is also candid about the role of the United States, which sponsored a military coup in Guatemala in 1954, trained the officer corps and worked with the intelligence services who planned and directed some of the worst abuses of the war.,But Washington has helped uncover its complicity. It provided more money than any other country to support the commission's work. Agencies that in the past refused to cooperate with Latin American truth commissions or trials turned over important files to Guatemala. The Agency for International Development and the Central Intelligence Agency were especially cooperative.,The report emerges at a time of uncertainty about whether Guatemala can become a real democracy. The commission does not name the guilty, out of fear of provoking the military. The Government's response is crucial. President Alvaro Arzu  has so far been silent. He should endorse the report and quickly establish a body to see that its recommendations are carried out. The commission stressed the need to dismiss military officers who are credibly accused of serious crimes. The report calls for prosecution of those responsible for the worst atrocities and recommends payment of reparations to victims' families. The commission's courageous report describes a hellish past.

"To the Editor:,Bernard Holland is worried about dwindling classical-music audiences, and exasperated by what he characterizes as rather lame attempts to prepare them for the concert experience [''Making Music Something To Be Seen,'' Feb. 7]. ''Let's load it down with reading and listening materials, make it sit at home and prepare, then herd it into music appreciation courses and preconcert panel discussions,'' he says of the standard approach to audience enlightenment.,This he contrasts with the rock-music world, which presumably has no such preparation problems. But as anyone who has ever attended a rock concert knows, rock fans are the most well-prepared audience of all. They have listened to the same songs over and over again, know all the words, own the CD and have memorized every last drum-lick and turn of phrase.,What's more, their preparation is exuberant fun, not a task to be dreaded. Let's not lose sight of the fact that classical music is also exuberant fun. If it were not so, there wouldn't be thousands of young students clamoring to audition for the Juilliard School, Eastman or Peabody. These budding artists are hardly masochists, beating their breasts with dour, old-fashioned music. They are people who, like their rock counterparts, know their music intimately.,Let's not apologize for the prep factor in classical music, and let's not make classical music out to be some kind of bitter pill to be swallowed.,LINDA KOBLER,Erie, Pa.,The writer taught music history at Juilliard.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",GROOMING AUDIENCES; Informed Rock Fans,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/l-grooming-audiences-informed-rock-fans-500178.html
"THIRTY years ago, Erba Food Products was struggling to get by, making kosher specialties in a tiny 2,000-square-foot factory within earshot of Yankee Stadium, and its prospects looked as limited as its market, New York's dwindling population of observant German Jews.,Today, Erba is booming. In its 75,000-square-foot plant in the Canarsie district of Brooklyn, the company's 100-odd employees pack kosher products from wines to soups to  salsas and barbecue sauces, half for the New York area and half for beyond.,Erba's success is no fluke. Other kinds of manufacturers have been fleeing cities like New York for decades, chasing lower costs, lower taxes, lighter regulation and ample elbow room in the suburbs or the Sun Belt. But in one industrial niche, specialty foods, urban cores have been incubators for entrepreneurial companies. With their trend-setting, culturally diverse populations, the cities help such companies thrive.,''If you want to change something, you need to be close to a large market, so you can understand the potential,'' said William Max Bauer, Erba's chief executive.,Buoyed lately by the immigration of observant Jews and a renewal of many secular Jews' interest in cultural traditions, New York remains the country's largest market for kosher food. But it is also home to dozens of other ethnic and cultural niche markets. Specialty food makers of all kinds employ more than 20,000 people in the city.,MUCH of the growth in the food market, particularly for newer companies, is in items at the luxury end of the spectrum. For example, cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, with their large populations of sophisticated consumers, have nurtured a new breed of fancy baked-goods companies known as artisan bakeries.,One such business, the Tom Cat Bakery of New York, supplies handmade bread to more than 400 restaurants in Manhattan. It sees a growing national market for artisan bakeries' products, but says an urban home is a vital launching pad.,''You need a market that values the taste,'' said Noel Comess, Tom Cat's president. Formerly a chef at the Quilted Giraffe restaurant, Mr. Comess now oversees 140 workers at a sprawling plant in Long Island City, Queens, just across the East River from Manhattan.,''The taste that goes out the door here has a big market in New York,'' he said. ''People here will pay for a better bread, just like they'll pay for a finer bottle of wine.'',But many of the most successful specialty foods come from city neighborhoods. Tower Isles Frozen Foods produces Jamaican meat pies in East New York, Brooklyn. Started in the 1960's by two immigrants from Jamaica, Earl and Beryl Levi, Tower Isles has flourished, first with the growth of New York's English-speaking Caribbean population, and later as their products caught on with other New Yorkers.,Another important advantage of big old cities is their marketing channels. Tower Isles began by selling through a network of small groceries owned by Jamaican immigrants, and later branched out to New York's ubiquitous pizzerias. Such tactics, of course, require independent and ethnic stores, and don't work as well in places dominated by chains, said Grover Nichols, Tower Isles' production and sales manager. ''It's hard to get your product sold through McDonald's,'' Mr. Nichols said.,SIMILAR stories are heard around the country. Large-scale immigration from Southeast Asia has turned Houston, better known for its ribs and Tex-Mex cuisine, into a major production center for egg rolls, fortune cookies and Vietnamese specialties.,Los Angeles, where drive-through hamburger joints once set the culinary pace, has seen an explosion of various kinds of specialty food manufacturing. Asian immigration has played a big role: Scores of companies making breads, pastries, tofu and noodles have cropped up to serve California's growing Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodian and Filipino communities.,But much of the action in the Los Angeles area is in Mexican foods, exemplified by young companies like El Burrito, which makes vegeterian chorizo sausage and salsa, and growth spurts by longer-established companies like Juanita's Mexican Foods. Begun as a fish processor in the 1940's, Juanita's switched to making menudo, a traditional Mexican tripe soup, and later added sauces.,''The market was here,'' said George de la Torre, Juanita's president and the son of its founder. ''Los Angeles is the biggest Mexican city in the world after Mexico City. You couldn't find a better place for selling Mexican food.'' It has also made a good base for expansion: A decade ago, five-sixths of Juanita's sales came from California, but today 40 percent of the company's $30 million in annual sales are in out-of-state markets like Phoenix, Denver and Chicago.,Erba, too, has built a wide-ranging business on its local base. Much of the company's sales growth now is overseas, not only in Israel but also in France, Belgium and Britain, where both Jewish and Muslim consumers buy its products.,Erba's export successes arose directly from its urban experiences. ''We started noticing that Muslims in New York were shopping in the kosher markets and kosher aisles of supermarkets,'' Mr. Bauer said. ''So when we went abroad, we found Muslims there to buy our product. We knew from New York what works.''",JOEL KOTKIN,"FEB. 28, 1999",GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; Savoring The Spice Of Urban Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/grass-roots-business-savoring-the-spice-of-urban-life.html
"To the Editor:,Re ''Ruling Said to Raise Census Cost by $2 Billion'' (news article, Feb. 24): Judging by the ways people across the country flock to lotteries, casinos and any other remote way of winning anything, perhaps the census takers should consider adding a few million dollars in fabulous prizes for the people who participate. That would be a drop in the bucket in a budget of $7 billion, and would be a cost-effective way to increase the number of participants (and thus the census's accuracy).,TIM LEAVITT,New York, Feb. 24, 1999",,"FEB. 28, 1999",G.O.P.

"Jeff Maggert and Andrew Magee had overcome difficult odds all week, and they did it again today. Moving one step closer to the biggest payday of their careers, Maggert and Magee overcame deficits and advanced to Sunday's 36-hole final match of the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship.,In today's semifinals, Maggert defeated Steve Pate, 1 up, after Pate led, 3 up, with seven holes to play. Magee was also a comeback winner, losing the first three holes to John Huston but storming back for a 3-and-1 victory in the second semifinal.,So Maggert, seeded 24th in the 64-player tournament, and Magee, seeded 50th, will meet Sunday at La Costa Resort and Spa for $1 million, more money than either player has ever won during a PGA Tour season. It has been an improbable week for both players, and for one of them, it will end in glorious fashion.,Others may be unhappy that more recognizable names did not advance to the finals. But for Maggert and Magee, who have not won on the PGA Tour for six and five years, the week has been fantastic.,''It was a great win yesterday, but that was just one of the hurdles to have a chance to win this golf tournament,'' said Maggert, who defeated the top-seeded Tiger Woods in Friday's quarterfinals to advance to today's match. ''When I got here Monday, Sunday is where I wanted to be. Winning the golf tournament is going to mean a lot more to me than the million dollars. I want the victory more than putting a few more dollars in my account.'',As he has all week, Maggert showed poise and determination against Pate, turning the tide when it appeared that Pate might be in command. With Pate holding a 3-up lead after 11 holes, Maggert started his comeback with an eagle at the par-5 No. 12 to win the hole, reaching the green in two shots, then making a 25-foot putt. Then Maggert won No. 13 as well, when Pate hit a poor approach shot into a greenside bunker and failed to get up and down for par.,''That was probably the turning point,'' said Pate, who will face Huston in Sunday's 18-hole consolation match for third place. ''I never felt I was in control, but I stopped making birdies, he started making birdies, and I made some mistakes.'',Maggert evened the match at No. 15 with a 9-foot birdie putt, and the momentum had clearly swung in his favor. Pate fell behind for good at No. 16 with another mistake, three-putting for a bogey when he missed a 5-foot putt for par.,But Pate did not fold, and it took superb play by Maggert on Nos. 17 and 18 to close the match. Pate hit a nice third shot at the par-5 No. 17 that landed 12 feet below the hole, but Maggert's approach was even better, landing 5 feet from the pin. Pate knew that if he missed his putt, Maggert would probably end the match on his next putt. But Pate made the 12-footer for birdie. Maggert followed by making his 5-footer for birdie as well.,So the match moved to the par-4 No. 18 with Maggert still 1 up, and there it ended. After both players reached the green in two shots, Pate had about a 30-footer for birdie that he missed 3 feet to the right. Maggert putted next from about 28 feet, and after leaving the putt about 4 feet short, he made the next putt to clinch the match. Maggert has not won on tour since 1993, but he has 12 second-place finishes in his career, and he said he had the confidence to win.,''It has been frustrating to be in situations to win golf tournaments and not win,'' Maggert said. ''That's what I judge myself on, being able to win. I know that I'm a good enough player. I can't look back and say, 'Gosh, I've come up short so many times.' '',Magee showed resolve as well, after starting his match against Huston by losing the first three holes. But Huston bogeyed No. 4, leaving him with a 2-up advantage and giving Magee hope. Before the match, Magee had run out of clean socks, and so he purchased two pairs at the clubhouse. Thanks to his comeback, Magee will wear the second pair during Sunday's match.,''I didn't expect to be here,'' said Magee, one of the tour's funniest players. ''I packed for the L.A. Open, and I packed to get maybe halfway through this week, then I was going home. But I've got to play now. I'm thrilled about it.'',Magee won Nos. 9 and 10 to even the match, then took the lead for good with a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 12. Magee took a commanding 2-up lead at No. 16, when Huston hit his approach shot into the bunker and failed to get up and down for bogey. The match ended at No. 17, when Huston hit his second shot into the hazard near the water, and Magee chipped in for birdie.,Asked about Sunday's championship match, Magee said: ''Yeah, I like money. Money is a motivating factor. I'm sure it's going to make all the other guys who didn't qualify very upset.'',But Maggert and Magee earned their way to Sunday's payday. Maggert defeated Fred Funk, Nick Price, Bernhard Langer, Woods and Pate. Magee defeated Darren Clarke, Thomas Bjorn, Bill Glasson, Shigeki Maruyama and Huston. So the first event in the new World Golf Championships series sanctioned by the five world PGA tours -- an event that has been unpredictable -- will end with Maggert or Magee as the champion.,''If it wasn't for Tiger, or Ernie Els and David Duval, our sport wouldn't be what it is, and those guys deserve credit,'' Maggert said. ''They have played better than I have over the last three or four years. But unlike other sports, the No. 50 or No. 60 best player is not that far from being No. 1. On any given day, he can be the best player in the world. I think everyone has witnessed that this week.''",CLIFTON BROWN,"FEB. 28, 1999",GOLF; From 64 to 2: It's Maggert Versus Magee,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/golf-from-64-to-2-it-s-maggert-versus-magee.html

"To the Editor:,Those who study the causes of the Holocaust owe much to the work of Ian Kershaw, the author of ''Hitler. 1889-1936: Hubris'' (review, Jan. 31). But his claim that there would have been no Holocaust without Hitler is a misreading of the history of anti-Semitism in Germany. Hitler was but one of hundreds of leaders of paramilitary groups who were every bit as anti-Semitic as he was. In 1920, Orgesch, whose leaders called often and publicly for death to the Jews, had some 300,000 members, 2.5 million rifles, 100,000 machine guns, 3,000 pieces of artillery and 30 aircraft. The tens of thousands of German veterans who fought for German dominance in the east even after 1918 harbored a murderous hatred for the Jews. In the 1920's there were millions of pieces of literature blaming the Jews for all of Germany's ills and calling for revenge.,Hitler's putsch made him the acknowledged leader of such men. Moreover, the German elites, who selected Hitler to be Chancellor in 1933, had campaigned on anti-Semitic platforms since 1892. After 1918, the campaign literature of their German National People's Party, the D.N.V.P., was indistinguishable from that of the Nazis. In 1919, the former Kaiser himself called for the gassing of the Jews. From 1930 on, as Hitler's votes rose, the representatives of the High Command and other elite groups advised President Paul von Hindenburg to bring Hitler into the Government. Had they thought, as Kershaw suggests, that they could moderate his extremism, they would never have put him beyond their control by handing him absolute power as well. Finally, we have countless examples of high-ranking Germans voluntarily cooperating in every stage of the Holocaust.,Secular humanists, liberal pluralists and those who hold Judeo-Christian values will always be tempted to find in one evil and monstrous man the primary cause of the Holocaust. Nevertheless, we will not find in the psyche and life of Hitler an adequate explanation for what was, in fact, the act and will of hundreds of thousands of Germans.,John Weiss,Nyack, N.Y.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",Germany's Holocaust,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/l-germany-s-holocaust-414883.html
"SMOKE SCREEN,By Vincent Patrick.,376 pp. New York:,William Morrow & Company. $24.,IN his third novel, Vincent Patrick has taken elements from different genres, strung them together and come up with a narrative that satisfies on all sorts of levels. Traveling from international terrorism to cops-and-robbers caper and back again, ''Smoke Screen'' even manages moments of near slapstick that will keep readers chuckling while they stumble across the corpses.,Only the thriller aspect will surprise those who are familiar with Patrick's previous novels, ''The Pope of Greenwich Village'' and ''Family Business,'' both of which featured pickup gangs that could barely shoot straight while scheming to take on -- and (after a fashion) to best -- the cream of organized crime. Filled with snappy dialogue and occasional comic bumbling by overreaching protagonists, the books were hectic and fast-paced, sending audience sympathies careering from good guys to bad guys so quickly that it was soon difficult to remember just which was which. The payoff, if it ever came, would enrich a couple of people nobody had ever heard of, almost despite their own clumsiness.,In ''Smoke Screen'' the scope is much wider. A deadly virus smuggled into the United States will be released by a Cuban scientist unless the American Government gives in to demands of Fidel Castro. To defuse the menace, Linwood Cutshaw, the Director of Central Intelligence, suggests ''subcontracting'' the mission to an outsider, able to operate freely beyond the law, answerable only to Cutshaw himself.,Will this be yet another tedious tale of the brave and resourceful privateer taking on the forces of evil? Or will Patrick somehow return to his familiar territory of small-time hoods scamming their way through back alleys and ethnic neighborhoods? Cleverly, he manages both.,CUTSHAW'S complicated stratagem to derail the plot leads to one of Patrick's typically engaging odd couples. Teddy Tedesco is a retired New York City detective, currently an underutilized and overpaid security man at an Atlantic City casino; Frank Belmonte masterminded a particularly crafty hotel heist, so smoothly executed that there was never enough evidence for an arrest even though everyone knew who had pulled it off. With the aid of a couple of C.I.A. men (one is having what he thinks is a clandestine affair with the Director's daughter; the other turns out to be a borderline psychopath), the two are to repeat Frank's triumph, this time as a cover for the kidnapping of the Cuban scientist, who would then be persuaded to lead the forces of good to the hidden virus.,Things go awry or follow some further deviousness cooked up by Cutshaw; Frank and Teddy are cut loose, without the virus, without the Cuban, without allies. The pair eventually agree to continue tracking down the deadly contagion on their own, Teddy more or less because that's what cops, even retired ones, do, and Frank, also more or less, because he's convinced the missing Cuban has the loot from the robbery. A pursuit that inevitably recalls the twists and turns of ''The Manchurian Candidate'' leads to a suspenseful resolution in the rafters of Madison Square Garden.,However engaging the plot, though, the best thing about ''Smoke Screen'' is its characterizations. Both Teddy and Frank are complete and beguiling personalities, their droll exchanges about life on opposite sides of the law always interesting. Even the ostensible villain of the piece, the murderous Cuban, evokes a certain sympathy as he sees his beloved revolution begin to fray around him.",JAMES POLK,"FEB. 28, 1999",Germ Warfare,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/germ-warfare.html
"MARTYRED VILLAGE,Commemorating the 1944 Massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane.,By Sarah Farmer.,Illustrated. 300 pp. Berkeley:,University of California Press. $24.95.,AROUND 2 P.M. on June 10, 1944, trucks carrying 120 soldiers from a regiment of the Waffen SS tank division Das Reich drove into the small farming town of Oradour-sur-Glane in the Limousin region of central France. That same afternoon, with no apparent provocation, they murdered 642 men, women and children in what was the single worst massacre carried out by German troops during the four years of occupation. They then looted and torched the town.,Today, Oradour is more or less as the SS left it, preserved in its ruined state as a vivid way of denouncing evil, paying homage to innocent victims and evoking a nation's suffering. Over the years, millions of people have visited the town and heard guides retell how its men were gunned down in nearby barns and the women and children were burned to death in the church. The story has become familiar.,Oradour has long had a revered place in France's national memory. Yet if the idea of turning the ruins into a monument was to freeze a single moment of horror, in her fascinating book, ''Martyred Village: Commemorating the 1944 Massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane,'' Sarah Farmer demonstrates how Oradour was then drawn into a different nightmare. The town wanted to be a symbol; instead, it became a mirror of France's long, painful and divisive struggle to come to terms with itself after the war.,Farmer, an assistant professor of history at the University of Iowa, tells this story with evident sympathy for the survivors of the massacre, whom she came to know during years of research. But what makes her account so gripping is that, through the drama of Oradour, she also throws light on debates that continue to this day, not least about France's role in sending 78,000 Jews to Nazi death camps.,From the moment of the massacre, just four days after D-Day, politics came into play. The collaborationist Vichy regime blamed Resistance groups, active in Limousin, for provoking a German reprisal, while other French officials proclaimed Oradour's ''innocence'' of involvement with the Resistance. Even now, historians cannot agree on why Oradour was eliminated, but culprits continue to be found to suit political needs.,After the liberation of France, Oradour focused its energies on winning national recognition as a historical monument, yet it was far from clear what it should symbolize. A government inspector recommended preserving the ruins but advised his seniors ''to examine in what form national piety should finally be expressed.'' As Farmer puts it: ''In other words, Oradour should first be saved to become a symbol that would be useful to France. Its exact utility could be determined later.'',This would prove complicated. As France's new leader, Gen. Charles de Gaulle had other priorities: to unite the country and assert its claim to be treated as a victorious Allied power. For this, the role of the Resistance was inflated and the degree of collaboration played down. Meanwhile, Farmer points out, designation of the dead of Oradour as martyrs created ''a peculiar tension between the vision of France as a victim of the Nazis versus France as a proud country of resisters among the victor nations.'',Oradour's own chosen identity was that of innocent victim, but its emotional stance was to prove weaker than political expediency. When 21 of the soldiers involved in the massacre were finally bought to trial in 1953, 14 of them proved to be Frenchmen forced to join the SS after Germany annexed Alsace. Now, with Alsace again part of France, its population mobilized in favor of the accused Alsatians. The political pressure worked: 13 of the men were given light sentences and soon amnestied.,THE people of Oradour were outraged. In protest, they returned the Croix de Guerre and the Croix de la Legion d'Honneur given to them years earlier. They also refused to place the ashes of their dead in a crypt built by the government and for 10 years they displayed posters listing the names of the deputies who approved the amnesty. To their dismay, they had learned that national unity weighed more than justice.,Still, a new town was eventually built a few hundred yards away, and while survivors and relatives of victims have tried to prolong the wake, Oradour has gradually settled into its new role as tourist site. Even here time is taking its toll. Deterioration of the ruins is threatening the memorial and, in anticipation of the day when it is reduced to dust, Oradour will soon have a Centre de la Memoire. The next stage cannot be far away: when memory turns into history.",ALAN RIDING,"FEB. 28, 1999",Generation of Mourning,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/generation-of-mourning.html

In spite of weather that is warm one day, cold the next, things are happening outdoors.,And it does make the winter-bound gardener eager to get outdoors. Is there anything that can be done now without doing harm to the garden? There certainly is; it is pruning. But before getting into the details, several essentials need to be established. First, one needs to have a good sturdy pair of sharp pruning shears. A good quality pair of pruning shears can be bought for under $50. Try out several pairs of shears to be sure they fit the hand well and are easy to work.,The next necessity is a good pair of garden gloves -- not the thin, attractive kind but sturdy ones that protect the hands and keep them warm. These gloves should be the kind that will last through the season, not simply for one chore.,And, finally, there is the question of what kinds of pruning chores to tackle. Tall shade trees, even the younger ornamentals, are best left to tree experts, the arborists who know what they are doing and have the right equipment (and insurance) to do the job properly. Because the trees are dormant now, this is an excellent time to have such work done.,In addition, the pruning of fruit trees is tricky and is best left to the experts. Grapevines are pruned now, too, and unless the hobbyist knows well what to do, leave this to the skilled and informed.,What's left? Plenty.,One of the major reasons for pruning is to put plants back in shape to suit the property. Sometimes when houses are bought, the new owners are faced with overgrown gardens and darkened windows because the woody plants have been left to grow huge and overtake the landscape.,In many cases, some of the plants can be cut back -- hard -- to return them to form. This is called rejuvenation pruning. Though it may seem drastic at first, in a few years the effort will be rewarded. Some plants that can be treated drastically -- that is to a foot or less high -- include forsythia, mock oranges, holly, rhododendrons, privet and mountain laurel. If there are questions about such drastic treatment, consult a local arborist or nursery owner for advice.,Several ornamental plants should also be pruned at this time of year. These are the plants that will bloom on the current season's growth. The first plant that comes to mind, of course, is the rosebush. But wait until the forsythia blooms, to work on the roses. This will allow any winterkill to be clearly evident, and the bushes can be pruned to encourage airy growth.,Plenty of other woody plants will need some tending. Buddleias, the butterfly bushes, need attention if they were not pruned last fall. These shrubs will bloom better. Peegee hydrangea need attention now, too. These large-growing plants provide magnificent August bloom if given the appropriate care now. The same is true for the magnificent rose of Sharon.,But there are many woody plants that should not be pruned now. The correct timing of pruning is probably ones of the hardest things for gardeners to learn, because many people are afraid they will do the wrong thing. This happens only if the timing of the pruning is wrong.,The plants not to prune now are those that bloom on wood that grew last year. The buds for spring bloom are already set for this year. If the pruning is done now, the flower buds would be cut off. No bloom.,Among the many shrubs that bloom in the spring are such favorites as forsythia, summersweet, deutzia, lilac, viburnum, mock orange, spiraea, azalea, pieris and kerria. These glorious spring-blooming shrubs deserve their usual show time. The proper time to prune them back is immediately after bloom. Sometimes gardeners neglect this chore and think they can delay the pruning until sometime in summer, because, after all, the shrubs bloomed. But if this pruning is delayed until too late in the year, the next spring flower buds that are forming in summer will be cut off. All will be lost. The objective: remember to prune immediately after bloom.,There is always a case of a straggly branch or two that does get in the way, no matter whether the shrub blooms on last year's wood or this year's wood. In such cases, these nuisance branches should be pruned, to get them out of the way. The same logic holds for any shrub that is oversized and needs a good trimming back.,But do remember that when spring comes, there will be a surge of new growth. It might be better to wait to see where some of these plants are growing before giving them too drastic a trim.,The most important thing to remember when pruning is that it is a form of art. In the hands of a wise gardener, the results can always be spectacular, but the only way to become expert is to learn by doing.",JOAN LEE FAUST,"FEB. 28, 1999",GARDENING; Get Out the Gloves and Pruning Shears,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/gardening-get-out-the-gloves-and-pruning-shears.html
"Bronx, Seat of Empire,Q.  Why is New York nicknamed the Empire State?,A.  We assumed that the origin of the term would be found too far afield to include in this column, perhaps in one of those upstate counties with a long Dutch name, uttered by an obscure 18th-century lawmaker.,Wrong. According to Joseph F. Meany, the New York State historian, the term -- which first appeared on New York license plates in 1951 -- is attributed to George Washington, who reportedly exclaimed: ''Surely this is the seat of empire!'' while traveling on horseback through the Bronx.,It was late November 1783, according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian, and Washington was traveling south from the Van Cortlandt house with the Governor of New York, George Clinton, to take possession of New York City after  the British evacuation. General Washington would have traveled a route roughly parallel to Tibbetts Brook, which at the time continued to Spuyten Duyvil Creek. There, he  crossed the bridge at what is now Kingsbridge Avenue and 230th Street and proceeded to lower Manhattan.,History doesn't record what sort of vista confronted Washington as he made the portentous utterance, nor is it clear whether he was admiring the area's natural bounty or speculating on the young republic's political geography. Much of the Bronx, particularly the area surrounding the King's Bridge, had been ravaged during the Revolution. Lewis Morris, owner of the large estate to the south, seemed to take Washington literally, and that year sent a letter to the Continental Congress proposing the area now called Morrisania as the permanent capital of the United States. According to Mr. Ultan, Congress tabled the letter and never considered it.,Eyes on the Doughnut,Q.  Many years ago, after ice skating in Central Park, my parents would take my brother, my sister and me to a little coffee shop on the southeast corner of 59th Street and Fifth Avenue. On the wall were these words: As you ramble on through life, brother,/Whatever be your goal,/Keep your eye upon the doughnut,/And not upon the hole. Why?,A.  You were in a Mayflower Doughnut shop, one of the last in the city, actually, and that bit of doggerel was the personal motto of the founder, Adolph Levitt. Known as the Optimist's Creed, the words were printed on each box of doughnuts sold in the Mayflower shops, where they were framed by two cartoon jesters, one frowning at a thin doughnut with a large hole, the other grinning at a plump one with almost no hole at all.,Mr. Levitt, an immigrant from Russia, first saw the anonymous verse in a picture frame he bought in a dime store, according to his granddaughter, Sally Levitt Steinberg.,Adolph Levitt saw many a doughnut. In the early 1920's, passers-by pressed against the windows of his bakery on 125th Street to watch him fry his doughnuts in a kettle. Determined to find a way to prepare them faster and without the greasy fumes,  he hired an engineer to design a mechanized doughnut fryer. Mr. Levitt was able to sell the resulting contraption to bakeries around the country, and in 1931 he opened the first Mayflower doughnut shop. At Broadway and West 45th Street,  which the city briefly renamed Doughnut Corner, the shop served Maxwell House coffee and featured a working doughnut machine in the window. Mayflower shops, all bearing the Optimist's Creed, dotted the city for decades, but had all but disappeared by the 1970's.,The Immortal Teletype,Q.  Is that an actual Teletype machine I hear in the background when I listen to WINS, the all-news radio station?,A.  Nope. It's a digitally stored recording of an old Teletype Model 15, according to Bill Wilson, a technician at the station. The open microphone in the teletype room was removed years ago. ''Someone cursed, and it went out on the air,'' he said. WINS switched to tape cartridges, then to a digital recording about 10 years ago. Teletype machines started disappearing in the 1970's. ''It's the signature sound of the station,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''Every time we turn it down, someone calls and complains that they can't hear the ticker.''   DANIEL B. SCHNEIDER",DANIEL B.

"THERE'S a doctoral thesis to be written, if it hasn't been already, on the life cycle of beach hideaways. The table of contents might begin with ''Phase One: Backpackers Discover the Pristine Fishing Village,'' and continue with ''Phase Two: Rum and Ceiling Fans -- The Guesthouse Years,'' followed by ''Is That an Umbrella in My Drink? Phase Three: Corporate Resort Development.'',As a budget traveler, I am always looking out for up-and-coming paradises that have progressed past phase one, but are not yet into phase three. I want to go where I know I can stay in a place that has, at least, a roof and a fan (no tents on the beach, thank you), where I can eat without fear of dire consequences a variety of well prepared meals, and where I won't have to wade through a sea of chaise longues on my way to the ocean. Finally, I want to stay where the local community controls a decent-size slice of the tourism business, and is at peace with the influx of strangers to its shore.,When I find a place that fits these qualifications, and costs less than $75 a day, I rejoice, and hold my breath wondering how long it will take for the condo developers to descend. I've been in such a state of nervous anticipation about Las Terrenas, my favorite little beach spot in the Caribbean, ever since friends in the Dominican Republic introduced me to it seven years ago.,A gorgeous crescent of beach nestled between dramatic roller-coaster mountains and the roaring Atlantic Ocean on the Samana peninsula (the tiny appendage of land that juts like a tail from the northern coast of the island of Hispaniola), Las Terrenas instantly stole my heart. I stayed in a simple but pretty guesthouse that served fine French and local cuisine (it was one of only four or five small hotels in town). By day, I shared the beach with fishermen repairing their hand-hewn boats (called yolas), and by night I walked in the velvety air and moonlight across empty stretches of sand. Las Terrenas back then had no electricity, only a handful of generators that shut down around midnight -- when all became dark and silent, save for the occasional sound of a villager wringing a sad Dominican ballad, or bachata, from his homemade guitar in one of the bars.,On my last trip there, five years ago, the village was abuzz with excitement -- the electrical power lines were due to arrive within a few months. Uh-oh, I thought. But Las Terrenas is not easy to reach. To get there by car takes a nerve-racking four-hour drive from the international airports in Puerto Plata or Santo Domingo, on two-lane roads that wind perilously over the mountain ridge. There's a tiny local airport in the village of El Portillo, three miles from Las Terrenas, but it isn't big enough for jumbo jets.,Yes, part of Las Terrenas's magic is its inaccessibility, I kept reminding myself, gritting my teeth and gripping the wheel of a scratched-up 1995 Hyundai. The week before I'd phoned that pretty guesthouse, the Tropic Banana, and found that it was still in business and still cheap even in high season: only $50 a night for a single with breakfast.,As is the way of the tropics, my plans had already hit a snag. I'd chosen a flight that arrived in Puerto Plata around noon, which allowed me plenty of daylight to climb and descend that nail-biting section of mountain road that serves as a natural barrier to Las Terrenas. But when I got to the Budget rental-car counter at the airport, I was told there was a ''problemita'' with my car -- mainly that it wasn't ready. I was O.K. with the 15- or 20-minute wait the agent promised, and wandered off to one of the airport's outdoor kiosks to have a cold Coke and a quipe -- the Middle Eastern ball of fried ground lamb and wheat introduced by Syrian immigrants in the 1930's. The air was hot and it smelled rich, like flowers and cooking fires intermingled. I took a deep breath and felt impossibly happy for a moment, until I returned to the Budget counter.,Still no car. Nearly two hours later, as I was about to explode from overheating and impatience, a workman pulled up with the Hyundai. Its air-conditioner was blasting and the radio was pulsing full-throttle merengue. I was dubious -- I wanted a new car -- but I was worried that would take another hour, and I only had four left before nightfall. So I took the Hyundai. Its engine shivered and trembled a bit when I had to stop for red lights in the town of Sosua. But on the open road it seemed O.K., and I began to enjoy the ride. I cruised the dial to listen to tiny rural Dominican radio stations, where announcers interrupted the latest recorded bachatas with death and concert announcements, and read commercials for ''Sanchez's Funeral Home . . . now with American coffins!'',THE road followed the coast, more or less, passing through tiny villages with names that danced deliciously off the tongue: Los Yayales, Laguna de Gri-Gri. I reached the foot of the mountains of the Samana peninsula just as the light began to turn golden. The Hyundai climbed fitfully and reluctantly, but I made it to the top, where I stopped at a roadside bar and ordered a hot, black espresso and sat back on a white iron-filigree chair to admire the sunset and the view, which lived up to my memories as spectacular. To the north far below, spread the beach and village of Las Terrenas and the ocean; to the south stretched the Bay of Samana, famous as the site where Columbus's ships were attacked by volleys of arrows in the 15th century.,The Tropic Banana also lived up to my memories; the tall palms still swayed, the grounds were impeccable (Hurricane Georges, which ravaged Santo Domingo to the south, caused only light damage in Las Terrenas), and the rooms had even been refurbished -- mine was larger than five years before, with a double bed. It had a room safe, which I found useful, and a telephone, which I never touched. I checked in quickly, for there was a small sliver of daylight left, and then walked the 50 yards or so into town, which was jumping with tourists of all ages -- young adults, families with children, elderly men -- speaking French, Italian, German and Spanish. One of the enjoyable  things about Las Terrenas is that no matter what language you studied in high school, there's probably someone there who speaks it -- and everyone seems to speak a little English as well.,Little motorbikes that served as minitaxis for tourists scurried to and fro in front of -- what was this! -- a new shopping mall.,I continued my inspection of town. Outside a little grocery, or colmado, several men lingered over beers, chatting and drinking in the sunset ritual practiced throughout the country. One of them, a weather-beaten villager in a big straw cowboy hat, had a guitar. I bought a round of cold, frosty Presidente beers, and asked the man to play a tune, and he immediately launched into a mournful, soulful bachata that soothed away all the tension of my long, difficult day. Las Terrenas may look different, but at least this hadn't changed, I thought.,Back at the hotel, I ate a satisfying dinner of stewed fish with white rice prepared in the Dominican style -- boiled, with a shimmer of oil and a slight crustiness. And then I returned to my room for a well-deserved rest.,On a Friday night in Las Terrenas, during peak tourist season, that was not to be. What once was a little-used beach road in front of the Tropic Banana was now one of the main drags, an I-95 for the Dominican kids ferrying tourists back and forth on the motoconchos. The putt-putting and drone were noisier than the street outside my New York apartment. I dug out my earplugs, which  helped. At around 1 A.M., the noise stopped, and I took out the earplugs. Bad idea -- at 6:30 sharp, as workers headed out to their jobs at the one 300-room hotel that had been built farther down the beach, the rumble resumed.,Expecting a quiet, lonely beach vacation, I'd landed in a kind of boomtown by the sea. At first, I was irritated, but then I began to see the bright side of Las Terrenas's bubble economy. The motoconcho drivers, mostly young local boys, along with fellow townspeople who ran shops, restaurants and guesthouses, had clearly prospered from the influx of  tourists. One large concrete hotel and a few condominiums that were run by Italians now dotted the beach. This, along with the lively activity of the many Italian tourists, who played boccie in the afternoons at Tropic Banana, and sang while picnicking on the beach with their children, created a genial, carefree atmosphere.,Best of all, Las Terrenas now had lots of terrific, affordable restaurants. Across the street from the Tropic Banana was Pueblo de Los Pescadores, a tropical restaurant row housed in picturesque converted fishermen's shacks. One of the shacks, Pescaderia Sissy, still sold the catch of the day. But the neighboring huts, which all had tables facing the beach, were bars and restaurants. The best of these was Boga, run by two Spaniards from the Basque region, where I enjoyed a plate of fresh grilled shrimp rich with olive oil and garlic and a glass of white wine under a starry sky for around $9.,ABOUT a mile down the beach, at a colonial-style hotel called Las Cayenas, I had a delicious and hearty lunch of Dominican cangrejo guisado (crabmeat stewed in tomatoes and peppers), rice and beans and a beer, again about $9. With all the Italians about, it didn't take me long to find spectacular thin-crust pizza -- La Capannina had many varieties available, for around $7 an individual pie.,The motoconcho nights continued, but after a while I didn't mind. I went out on a snorkeling excursion one morning ($10) with four scuba divers. A tiny boat took us out about a half mile to where the coral begins. I struggled in the deep water to stay over the parrotfish and sea fans waving in the strong current -- not the best snorkeling I've seen, but a nice bracing swim nonetheless.,I also read on the beach -- no one disturbed me -- and, one day, drove all the way out to the tip of the peninsula, stopping to look at Samana village's historic church that was founded by African-Americans who migrated here from Philadelphia in the 1840's. The gray, slant-roofed building with its tall steeple looked as if it had been plucked straight from a small New England town.,I continued up the coast to another village, Las Galeras, that I'd heard was the ''next'' Terrenas. It had a spectacular beach, a couple of hotels -- one, Club Bonito, was large and luxurious and empty and offered me an air-conditioned room overlooking the ocean for $70 a night. There wasn't a motoconcho in sight. But there were no Italian restaurants, either, just a lonely little restaurant that didn't smell inviting. I turned around and drove back to noisy, bustling Las Terrenas.,On my last night in town, I moved to one of the cheaper guesthouses farther from the beach, Casa Robinson. My room cost $26 -- it was smaller, didn't face the ocean, breakfast wasn't included, and the hotel consisted of tightly spaced concrete condos. For a long stay, it wouldn't be bad, but for a week's vacation, I think the Tropic Banana is the better choice.,As I'd feared, the morning I was to return to Puerto Plata, the Hyundai gave a rattle and shake and began spewing smoke from under the hood. Anxious, I pulled over in front of a restaurant called La Cocina. The owner, Esteban, a Hungarian immigrant, looked at it, shook his head and invited me in for coffee. He found a mechanic, who fiddled a bit under the hood and frowned.,Esteban let me use his phone to call Budget in Puerto Plata; at 9:15 A.M., they decided to send out a driver with a new car ''right away,'' and said he should be there by lunchtime. At 12:30 I ordered lunch -- a delicious risotto of chicken livers for only $3 -- thinking the driver would arrive any minute. But Esteban shook his head and poured himself a brandy. ''Two o'clock,'' he said. ''The driver will stop for lunch. Nobody in this country skips lunch.'',At 1 P.M., no driver still. I began fuming. Noticing this, Esteban puttered into his office, rummaged in a drawer, pulled out a piece of paper and placed it on the table by my coffee. It was printed in flowery letters. I chuckled, for Esteban had  handed me the perfect refrain for my return to Las Terrenas: ''God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.'',The bottom line: finding a not-so-hidden hideaway,I spent an average of $67.84 a day on lodging, meals and activities during my six days in and around Las Terrenas.,Getting There,I flew round trip to Puerto Plata  from Kennedy Airport, with a stopover in Miami, on American Airlines for $511.92, including all taxes but not the mandatory $10 Dominican Republic tourist card and an airport departure tax of $10.,The daily rate for the 1995 Hyundai from Budget in Puerto Plata (I reserved in the United States) was $45, not including insurance ($19.30 daily) or 6 percent tax. The 120-mile drive from Puerto Plata airport to Las Terrenas is a hard one along two-lane roads; it can take four hours.,I was not aware, at the time I made my plans, that a small new company called Air Santo Domingo, (809) 683-8020, has begun service on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday between Santo Domingo International Airport and the small airport in El Portillo three miles from Las Terrenas. The round-trip fare ($98) is much more attractive than a car rental. If I were to do this trip again, I'd fly into Santo Domingo instead of Puerto Plata and take the local flight into El Portillo.,Accommodations,The Tropic Banana, Las Terrenas, (809) 240-6110, fax (809) 240-6112, is one of the best budget hotels in the Caribbean. The room rates are $50 for a high-season single, $70 double, including Continental breakfast. Favored by French families and single travelers who come to escape the European winter, the hotel occupies several acres of immaculately groomed grounds with palm trees, tennis and boccie courts, and a lovely swimming pool with inviting bright blue lounge chairs. Its restaurant serves Continental and Dominican dishes. Dinner with wine costs about $16 a person. The rooms have private baths and are spacious, clean and airy.,Casa Robinson, on the Portillo Road in Las Terrenas, telephone and fax (809) 240-6496, is typical of the inexpensive, simple two-story guesthouses that dot the village of Las Terrenas. My room with private bath and ceiling fan rented for $26.66 a night, without breakfast; they also have rooms with kitchen facilities for around $40 a night. The beach is a short walk away.,At Las Cayenas Hotel, (809) 240-6080, fax (809) 240-6070, set back slightly from the main beach road in a two-story reproduction of a colonial gingerbread house, a single with bath and a vine-covered balcony was $53 a night with breakfast. A restaurant on the grounds serves robust, Dominican-style lunches of rice, beans and various kinds of stewed fish for around $10. Las Cayenas doesn't have a pool, but is in a quieter area than Tropic Banana.,In Las Galeras, a more remote beach village that is just beginning to be developed for tourism, Club Bonito, and its neighbor hotel, Casa Blanca, telephone (809) 696-0082 for both,  looked like inviting alternatives to the jumping Las Terrenas scene. I was offered a spacious, bright room decorated in tropical prints with two double beds and a balcony for $70.,Dining,Boga, Calle de la Playa, (809) 240-6321, on the beach, serves expertly prepared seafood entrees hearty with olive oil and garlic. My dinner of shrimps broiled in garlic -- with wine, coffee and dessert -- came to $11.,La Cocina, (809) 240-6606, on the main road that runs through Las Terrenas village, looks like an eastern European thrift shop plunked down in a tropical jungle. The food, mostly Dominican specialties with a European twist, is as fantastic as the setting -- and one of the best deals in town. My lunch special of richly flavored chicken-liver risotto, plus an espresso, came to $3.30. Dinners cost about $9.,Ristorante Italiano La Capannina, (809) 844-4812, on the Portillo Road in Las Terrenas, serves tasty thin-crust pizzas for around $7.,In Sosua, on my way back to Puerto Plata, I dined splendidly at the  Restaurant Atlantico, (809) 571-2878, across from Villa Almonte. A full three-course meal of Dominican specialties like fish in coconut sauce came to $20.,Activities,My snorkeling excursion was arranged with the dive shop on the premises of the Tropic Banana and cost $10. I brought my own equipment, but I would have paid the same even if I had not.,The information kiosk in the town center, La Casa de Las Terrenas, (809) 240-6251, a private venture run by an expatriate Frenchman, has a small paperback library with some titles in English. I rented Jane Austen's ''Emma'' for 75 cents. The center will also arrange horseback expeditions to nearby waterfalls and bicycle and motorbike rentals.

"Twenty years ago, James Wilson spent a brief but critical few months as a student at Public School 79 in the Bronx. He barely learned to read or write, and because of his mental retardation, he never really grew up.,But Mr. Wilson made friends. And after the once rambunctious fifth grader became a destitute adult, charged with a robbery he insisted he did not commit, those friends saved him from a nightmare.,Mr. Wilson, now 31, walked out of the Rikers Island jail on Friday afternoon a free man, thanks to two of his former P.S. 79 teachers and dozens of acquaintances who fought a four-month battle to prove that the state had jailed an innocent man.,''He's no angel, but he's no criminal,'' said Ed Prisinzano, a gym teacher who helped organize a neighborhood crusade to rescue Mr. Wilson, and who was present when the robbery charge was dismissed. ''I never thought for a moment that he could have committed this crime.'',Mr. Wilson was arrested on Oct. 18 shortly after five men were robbed of jewelry and cash at gunpoint in the vestibule of their Bronx apartment building. The police found Mr. Wilson nearby, on the platform of the Metro-North station at Fordham. He was fast asleep, with two other homeless young men at his side. None of the stolen goods were found on him, but at least one of the victims said Mr. Wilson might have been one of the two men who robbed him.,Word of his arrest reached his friends at P.S. 79 a few days later. They could not believe it.,''We knew we had to do something,'' said Wendy Silvera, the other of Mr. Wilson's grade school teachers who helped campaign to free him. ''James would never rob anyone for money. Money doesn't mean anything to him.'',Mr. Wilson left the school early in the sixth grade, but he had remained a familiar presence in the neighborhood, even after his mother and his grandmother, who had cared for him, died. He ate many of his meals a few blocks away, at a food distribution center for the homeless called Part of the Solution, and attended counseling sessions nearby.,For years, Mr. Wilson would visit his old teachers, sometimes bringing them their mail and smilingly cadging money and candy.,''He'd ask me for a dollar here, a dollar there,'' recalled Mr. Prisinzano. ''We'd give him food when he came around. We'd give him clothing.'',When they learned of Mr. Wilson's arrest, his friends feared most for his safety. Their first letter, signed by teachers and others who knew him, was sent a few days before Thanksgiving.,It pleaded with the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, to protect Mr. Wilson. With his ''diminished mental capacity,'' it said, he could become easy prey to other inmates.,By then, the proceedings against Mr. Wilson were moving swiftly.,His lawyer, whom Mr. Prisinzano would not identify yesterday, began talking about a plea bargain with the District Attorney's office soon after his arrest. An agreement was reached. No grand jury heard the case. On Dec. 1, Mr. Wilson pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of attempted robbery and was given a prison sentence of two years.,Mr. Prisinzano said that Mr. Wilson did not understand what was happening and did not understand that he had other options than the plea that his lawyer suggested.,By then, the teachers were deep into amateur detective work. They searched homeless shelters and soup kitchens for alibi witnesses, talked with the robbery victims, and visited the crime scene.,Mr. Wilson's sleeping buddies from the Fordham station were frightened to talk, Mr. Prisinzano recalled, and had to be coaxed through intermediaries to give their stories to the teachers.,More letters were sent to the authorities, now arguing that evidence collected by Mr. Wilson's supporters showed he was not guilty of participating in the robbery in any way.,From a legal and procedural point of view, the District Attorney's office faced an odd situation. Mr. Wilson's original lawyer had not filed any motions to withdraw the guilty plea.,But the persistence of Mr. Wilson's friends paid off. The case was investigated again, and at the District Attorney's instigation, the plea was withdrawn and the charge dismissed. Mr. Wilson, as reported by The Daily News yesterday, emerged from the Bronx Criminal Court building beaming.,''What was unique about this is that we were moving at the behest of friends of the defendant, not the defendant or his attorney,'' said Eric Warner, the senior executive assistant in the prosecutor's office.,The challenge now for Mr. Wilson's friends is to find him a home, supervision and help. Staff members from the Bronx school took up a collection for a small temporary room, but they want a more permanent arrangement.,Mr. Prisinzano, a teacher for 38 years and a native of the Bronx, said he also wants people to draw a lesson from Mr. Wilson's ordeal.,''James is not the only innocent man in prison,'' he said. ''And for every innocent one, there's a guilty one out on the street. So you have got to be absolutely sure. You have to have safeguards.''",SUSAN SACHS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Former Teachers Help Free Retarded Man Who Was Wrongly Imprisoned,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/former-teachers-help-free-retarded-man-who-was-wrongly-imprisoned.html
"EVEN in a heavy, ceaseless rain, the house is light, wrapped in the sea mist, the dunes and the high grasses that fill nearly every window of this sprawling five-bedroom house, built in Southampton, L.I., in the late 1980's, with ocean on one side and bay on the other.  The large living room is dotted with comfortable sofas and chairs upholstered in soothing shades of white and yellow, with a trace of gray on the walls. It is no surprise to learn that a decorator lives here. The place is camera ready. It is also available for rent, for the month of August, for $150,000.,Patricia Garrity and J. Geoffrey Hull, real estate brokers from Allan M. Schneider Associates who are showing the house, say it only recently came on the market and predict that it will rent quickly. Although $150,000 may sound like a sale price, not a rental, even this sum doesn't deliver a house with everything. To some of their clients, the house would represent a compromise, because it lacks a tennis court and shares the driveway with another mansion.,If someone had a higher budget and wanted a house without those particular drawbacks, Frank Newbold, a vice president of Sotheby's International Realty, who heads the East Hampton office, could offer one in East Hampton that is $500,000 for the summer season. That price produces a very large stucco house with tennis courts, a swimming pool, ocean views and exquisite gardens. The final cost on all rentals can be as much as 10 percent more, in this case $50,000, because the housekeeping and gardening staffs have to be paid, and that is extra.,Stories like that can drive an average person into an average bar, convinced there is no hope of finding a nice little spot for summer weekends, to taste the salt, to feel the sand. But in fact, there are places available all along the Northeast coast that are reasonably priced. Many towns on the New Jersey shore, on Cape Cod, on Fire Island and in Rhode Island offer rentals for a week or two that can house a family near the beach for about $2,000 a week or less. More expensive areas in Connecticut, the Hamptons, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket tend to restrict rentals to a month, or the season. Even in the Hamptons, it is possible to rent a small house for the season for less than $2,000 a week that will give access to the same natural and unnatural wonders that draw the wealthiest New Yorkers to the tip of Long Island. ''That's a big misconception, that it's impossible to rent out here,'' Mr. Hull said. ''I did a couple of rents of $15,000 for the season, and I have one studio for $5,000 for the season.'',But, brokers are quick to say, there is no time to waste. Brokers in beach towns throughout the Northeast say they are renting places earlier than ever, sometimes  beginning in November, and that many of the most expensive and least expensive places have already been rented. Most say that their inventory this year has declined,  as owners have decided they don't need the extra cash they get from renting. Prices are up between 5 and 10 percent over last year, and the record season of 1998 is expected to be equaled or exceeded this year.,Generally, demand is similar to last year's, although in the Hamptons, it seems to have dipped a bit. Brokers say the pool of renters has shrunk a little because so many decided to buy last year after several seasons of renting. Mr. Newbold said that sales in his office were triple the dollar volume of the previous year, and in January 1999, the sales were up 25 percent over the previous January.,Spurring matters along is the impending 2 percent transfer tax that will be levied on buyers of properties in all the East End towns, including Shelter Island, beginning in April to finance the acquisition of public space.,While demand is relatively steady in most places, there are exceptions. When a place becomes hot, everything changes quickly. Shelter Island, between the North and South Forks of Long Island, has long been a haven for people drawn to its slow pace and solid Victorians. For years, the real estate market was dead. But suddenly, it has become appealing to a new crowd.,BROKERS credit -- or give the blame for -- its new status primarily to Andre Balazs, the hip hotelier who bought an old motel-cum-restaurant and reopened it in the summer of 1997 as Sunset Beach. Mr. Balazs, whose other properties include Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles and the Mercer Hotel in SoHo, is married to Katie Ford, president of Ford Models, and has been spending weekends on Shelter Island for a number of years.,The effect of his venture was almost immediate. ''The market on Shelter Island has exploded,'' said Jane RuTon Harrison, the manager of the Shelter Island office for Allan M. Schneider. Places are still available, but demand has been much higher, and many are already rented. ''We've definitely come into vogue with the young Wall Street bonus people,'' Ms. Harrison said.,And Sunset Beach has brought international interest. ''I'm on the board of the Chamber of Commerce,'' she said, ''and last summer we got 30 calls a week from places like London and Los Angeles, wanting to know about Shelter Island.'' In the past, the island's tranquillity has been protected by the need to take a ferry to get there -- and the fact that the ferry stops running on summer nights at 2 A.M.,Prices are up about 20 percent over last year, she said, with one waterfront house renting for $30,000 just for July, ''which is crazy,'' Ms. Harrison said.,She said she was not sure that the excitement over Shelter Island could be maintained. ''For a lot of people who try it for one season, it won't be glamorous enough,'' she said. ''Everything closes up by midnight. There's no Hamptons night scene.'',Rents at the lower end, for perhaps a ranch house in a development, start at about $10,000 for the summer season, she said; to get close to the beach, about $20,000 a season is needed. A few years ago, she said, houses with pools rented for $12,000 for the season; now, they are $20,000. Still, the island is a bargain compared to many parts of the Hamptons; she still has, for instance, a rustic waterfront barn, on an estate, at $14,000 for the season.,Fire Island has also picked up this year, with rentals and sales booming. The long and narrow island, where no house is more than two blocks from the water and where cars are forbidden during the summer months, had lost some of its allure for buyers and even renters after storms in the early 90's washed away a number of houses. At the time, it seemed that the island itself might soon be swallowed by the sea.,The memory of those storms seems to have faded. Last year, the market improved, and now ''things are going great guns,'' said Ali Beqaj, a partner in Southwind Real Estate in Saltaire, where four-bedroom houses for the season rent for from $16,000 to $30,000. Usually, Mr. Beqaj said, people don't commit to rentals on Fire Island until March, when the ferry starts operating. This year, he said, they have been taking places without seeing them first. After many houses had languished on the market for years, sales suddenly also picked up, with 20 houses selling last year in Saltaire alone.,Finding the right place on Fire Island is a matter of picking the most congenial town.  The island, which has very few restaurants and stores, attracts all kinds of people, but each town is largely homogeneous. The Pines has long been a magnet for gay men, and many gay women have homes in Cherry Grove. Saltaire used to be mostly Irish; now it is mostly Jewish, Mr. Beqaj said. Some towns like Kismet and Ocean Bay Park allow groups to share houses and don't mind a little partying; others are so restricted they evoke mutterings about police states. Mr. Beqaj didn't even suggest Saltaire, where outdoor grilling is forbidden, for a client who does a show on grilling for the Food Network. Instead he found her a place in the more laid-back Fair Harbor, right next door.,Most beach areas within weekend driving or train distance are reporting the same robust business they had last year. Lyn Thomas, who manages rentals for Prudential Zack Realtors in Ship Bottom, on New Jersey's Long Beach Island, said that many people book places for the next summer as they are leaving. And, as in the Hamptons, so many people have bought in the last few years, she said, that the rental stock has been cut by as much as 10 percent.,About 90 minutes from Manhattan, the island offers housing at many price levels, Ms. Thomas said, including a four-bedroom house in Loveladies with ocean views for $7,500 a week in August and a five-bedroom house with a pool and hot tub for $25,000 a week in August. A four-bedroom house with ocean views in Surf City is $4,250 a week in August, a three-bedroom in Ship Bottom with boat slips is $2,450-$3,000 a week in August, and a three-bedroom apartment in a house near the beach in Brant Beach is $885 a week in July and August.,''It's very family oriented,'' Ms. Thomas said, with restaurants, stores, miniature golf, water sports, and fabulous beaches.'',Also about 90 minutes from Manhattan is Bellport, an old village on the South Shore of Long Island where the few rentals available have been moving briskly. Mark Petheram, the owner of Old Purchase Properties in Bellport, said he could show a prospective summer tenant a cottage right in the village for $7,700 for the season, or a large house on the most prestigious street with a pool for $66,000 for the season.,Listings are fewer this year, he said, because the owners are using the houses for themselves. Bellport is situated on the bay, but its residents have rights to an ocean beach across the bay on Fire island, part of the National Seashore, reached by a village-run ferry. ''It's a low-key, old-money'' kind of place, Mr. Petheram said. ''They don't drive a Rolls-Royce. They drive a Taurus.'',Farther away, but still reachable on weekends, is the coast of Rhode Island, which is more sedate than most of New Jersey and less expensive, with some exceptions, than the Hamptons. The style is casual, with the focus on the beach.,''We're living somewhere in the 60's,'' said Tom DePatie, a sales associate in Westerly at H. D. Randall. ''The early 60's.'',Like his counterparts elsewhere, Mr. DePatie said that rental inventory is down about 10 percent this year, in his case because of greater demand and less financial need for owners to rent. In the Westerly area, houses tend to be rented for a week, two weeks, or a month, but rarely for the season. People who want a place should start looking in November, he said, because demand is so great. ''We have 10 calls for every week we can rent,'' he said. Rates range from a low of $900 a week for a small three-bedroom house about a half a mile from the beach to a high of $30,000 a month for an oceanfront house with five or six bedrooms.,Finding a rental isn't hopeless, he said, but it's not easy. ''There's a week here or there,'' he said. ''There may be someone penciled in who will fall out.'',FARTHER up the coast, where rentals really are for vacations, not weekends, brokers in places like Nantucket, Block Island, Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod all say that business is strong and places are going quickly.,Jack Bulger of Country Village rentals in Nantucket said that prices, which range from about $2,000 to about $15,000 a week, are up about 10 percent. Last year was a banner year, he said, and he expected the same in 1999. But despite a construction boom that has seen workers commuting by plane to jobs on the island every day, the pace is still slow, with little nightlife.,And, he said, the island's famous code of behavior is still intact, despite the growth in the year-round population to almost 10,000. ''We still don't have any stoplights on the island, blinking or otherwise,'' he said, which forces people to use reason and consideration when traveling. There are also no chain stores, neon lights or purple houses. Almost everything is cedar shingled, with beach roses and hydrangeas for color.,On Martha's Vineyard, the cachet of the island has prompted people from New York and California who may know little of its charms to request ''Hamptons-style houses'' -- big places on the water with pools and tennis courts -- which brokers say they have very few of.,''For the most part, people use the oceans or the ponds,'' said Jill Hobby, a realtor with Conroy and Company in Chilmark, in Martha's Vineyard. The Vineyard, she said, is in the midst of a very hot rental season, with ''lots of calls, lots of money.'' Rents in the most desired section range from about $8,000 to $40,000 a week. Renovation is rampant, she said, as owners of charming older places realize they can take in a lot of money if they make improvements.,''You can't get a carpenter to save your life,'' she said.,The increasing interest in the island has altered the tone, she said. ''It's a different breed of people coming here,'' she said. ''It's not as laid back as it once was. Now it feels like they're coming here because they hear they should.'',Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island, is an easygoing place with little commercial development but less-expensive rentals than the more famous islands. Gail Hall, the owner of Ballard Hall Real Estate, said that two-bedroom rentals start at $900 a week, and that houses typically only go as high as $3,500. But there are very few rentals left, she said, as places have been booked very early. The best time to start looking, she said, is mid-January.,On Cape Cod, more accessible because unlike the Vineyard no ferry is required, rentals tend to be available for just a week or two at a time. Susan Peters, rental manager of Cape Shores Real Estate on Main Street in Wellfleet, said that many houses are already booked and that what remains is moving quickly.,''I can only tell you what's available today,'' she said.,Anyone who walked in at that moment, she said, could rent a four-bedroom, three-bath house on the edge of a dune, with steps to its own beach and panoramic views of the bay from the second floor, for $3,500 a week in July or August. Or they could rent a three-bedroom house about a seven-minute walk from Duck Pond for $3,000 a week.,Like many other agents in the Northeast, she has some rentals for less than $1,000 a week, but they go fast. For $875 a week in July or $925 in August, she could rent a two-bedroom, one-bath house less than two miles from the beach.,Surprisingly, brokers in the Hamptons sound less harried about the summer season. ''This year things are happening a little slower,'' said Mr. Newbold of Sotheby's. ''Weather has not been great on weekends, and the weather has been great in Florida. They're not focused on summer yet. Around March 1, it goes into full tilt.'',Brokers say they still have good houses available at all prices, although inventory is down as much as 25 percent in some towns and prices are up. In Southampton, brokers from Allan M. Schneider still have an old two-bedroom Arts and Crafts-style house on Henry Street, in the village, for $15,000 for the season, or a four-bedroom Victorian in town that is $32,500 for the season. At the higher end, they have a house in the estate section that is a half mile from the beach, for $95,000 for the season.,Although the houses are there, brokers  say that customers risk losing their first choice if they take too long to decide. Ms. Garrity said that for the first time, she uses her cell phone to call an owner right away if a customer shows interest, to make sure the house isn't rented without her having a chance to make a counter offer.,While tenants come from all over, the ''Hollywood moment'' in the Hamptons seems to be over, Mr. Newbold said. About three years ago, many celebrities rented homes, he said, but by and large they show up now just as occasional guests of one of the remaining celebrity residents, Steven Spielberg.,''The zenith came when Barbra Streisand was looking for a house,'' he said, ''and then she read that the locals thought she was paying too much, and they were making fun of her.'' She ended up not buying, but she does visit as a guest of Donna Karan. In their place, Mr. Newbold said, are just very very rich people from Europe as well as the United State, people of whom most people have never heard.,THE tone, too, has changed, he said. ''They used to say, where are the discos,'' he said. ''People treated this like a motel.'' Now, he said, ''they say they've heard that the Historical Society has walking tours. Their goal is to live here.  They care more about a sense of place.'',He said that houses were available for the merely affluent, not just the super rich. He said he could, for instance, provide a converted 19th century one-room school house overlooking farmland in Wainscott for $33,000 for the summer.,Because of the high prices, though, landlords grow increasingly careful. Patti Wadzinski, a broker for Cook Pony Farm in East Hampton, said that many landlords now require tenants to take out a short-term tenant insurance policy to cover personal injury or damage. And on extravagantly furnished houses, the security deposit may be more than the standard 10 percent.,But how do you evaluate someone who is renting a house for $150,000 a month? Mr. Newbold said that in a surprising number of cases, you don't have to. ''They usually know each other, or know people who know them,'' he said. Through word of mouth, they can be assured that tenants are appropriate, with a backup letter from a reference or a bank. In contrast to city rentals, however, it is the owner who pays the brokerage fee.,Inevitably, there are those who have reacted to the scene in the Hamptons, to what some locals call the ''vulgarians on the beach,'' by deciding they have had enough. They opt, Mr. Newbold said, for quieter places, like western Connecticut and Maine. Especially Maine, where, he noted, Martha Stewart, who owns two houses in the Hamptons, is now ensconced in the former Edsel Ford mansion on Mount Desert Island.,''There is definitely a migration,'' Mr. Newbold said. But, he said, for everyone who leaves, ''there are three who want to come.''",TRISH HALL,"FEB. 28, 1999","For Summer Rentals, It's High Season",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/for-summer-rentals-it-s-high-season.html
"THE Rev. Bobby Davis and the Rev. Christine Davis say a miracle inspired the creation of the Miracle Faith World Outreach Center in 1967 in Stamford. It was, say the couple, where Mrs. Davis's mother was cured of cancer following prayer meetings at her home.,But it took another miracle, bolstered by hard work, to enable the predominantly black, Bridgeport-based congregation to move to Monroe, a suburban town with few black residents, in December.,Mr. Davis, 56, and Mrs. Davis, 54, who have been married for 35 years and are the parents of six grown children, are the founders and senior pastors of the non-denominational Christian church.,''The Lord is on our side,'' said Mr. Davis during a recent interview. ''People sense God and His love here, and they see miracles. People are healed of their drug, alcohol and cigarette addictions, and this sets them free. That's what draws people.'',''People feel the love,'' Mrs. Davis said. ''When they feel we care for them, they want to come back. We make everyone feel equal, whether they work at a menial job or have advanced degrees. We want everyone to feel this is one body, one family.'',Over 12 years, church members raised the $2 million to open the first phase of the congregation's center on a 23.4-acre site on Main Street, near the Newtown border. Their goal is to build a dome large enough to accommodate 2,000 people, at an estimated cost of $3 million, over the next five years.,And the congregation is seeking to increase diversity among its membership, now 90 percent black and including 375 families from Stamford, Bridgeport, Danbury, Stratford, New Haven and surrounding towns. A church elder and director of operations, Anna Byrd, says the church looks after members' needs in education, housing, jobs and marriage. Ministries within the church offer counseling, support groups, youth mentoring and tutoring. ''We're very family-oriented,'' she said, ''and get involved in all aspects of people's lives where they need help. We have a book store and credit union, and we have a TV ministry broadcast on cable TV stations throughout the area.'',A church group called the Manna Team provides meals at its own center and in homeless shelters in Bridgeport. An evangelism group extends the church's ministry to prisons and convalescent homes.,Philip Senete, who lives in Monroe and is a member of the center's board, has been attending the church for 25 years with his wife and now-grown children. ''A big area of ministry for us is outreach,'' he said. ''It's a lot of work but it's so rewarding when you see people turn their lives around.'',The church's pastors, Mr. and Mrs. Davis, said they began studying the Bible together early in their married life and were deeply influenced by the teachings of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They attended the 1963 rally in Washington when Dr. King made his ''I have a dream'' speech and believe God was calling them to the ministry, even though they say they did not know it until 1967, a turning point in their lives.,''Chris's mother was dying of cancer and asked us to come to her house and pray. The family was also experiencing financial difficulty and needed the Lord's help,'' Mr. Davis said. After attending the prayer meetings and receiving cobalt treatments, Mrs. Davis's mother said she was cured. ''We believe it was a miracle, that the Lord healed her,'' Mr. Davis said. They prayed for miracles for people who were sick, injured or had fallen prey to addictions; they continued their weekly prayer meetings and merged with a Bible study group. Within a year they began holding Sunday services and in 1972 they moved into their first church, on Hope Street in Stamford.,During the 1970's they bought a gospel tent and took their evangelism on the road, establishing churches in Florida and North Carolina. They preached in parks and housing projects, and in 1976 opened a church on Harriet Street in Bridgeport. In 1986 they bought the Monroe property and began a fund-raising campaign. They closed the Stamford church and relinquished the churches in Florida and North Carolina to their boards of directors, focusing their resources on the new church.,Their efforts culminated in the opening of a 21,000-square foot multi-purpose center last Dec. 19. (The building's 750-seat sanctuary can double as a basketball court.) They said they plan to convert the building into a youth center once their dome  is completed. They also said they would retain the Harriet Street church in Bridgeport for community outreach.,The grand opening ceremony the week before Christmas proceeded joyfully, though the following morning messages of hate were found scrawled on the parking lot, sidewalk and an outside wall. No suspects have been apprehended, although the police investigation is continuing.,Disappointed and hurt by the sting of racism, the Davises were nonetheless buoyed by the prompt outcry by officials, clergy and residents who responded with letters to the editor, gifts of food and cash donations. A volunteer even cleaned up the mess.,''Our prayer is that those who did this will come to the knowledge of the love of God,'' Mr. Davis said. A week later, 20 members of the Monroe Clergy Association and the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport gathered at the church during a Bible study meeting in a show of solidarity for their sister church and for religious freedom everywhere, they said. Representative James Maloney of Danbury, the Monroe Selectman Karen Burnaska and a Monroe Town Councilman, Robert Mitchell, attended Sunday services at the church.,On Jan. 11, the Monroe Town Council issued a proclamation denouncing the vandalism and thanked local people for their support of the religious group. And the executive director of the Connecticut Anti-Defamation League in New Haven, Robert Leikind, noted that public condemnation is a powerful tool in the struggle against hate crimes. Such a response ''marginalizes the act and actors,'' he said. ''People realize the extent of public outrage and accept the status of the perpetrators as a very few people who are motivated by hate.'' The state's Hate Crime Act, passed two years ago, requires local police departments to record hate crimes and report them to the State Police. Mr. Leikind said the law has had the positive effect of promoting more aggressive police investigations of hate crimes. In some instances the perpetrators are caught and punished, adding another deterrent, he said.,This was the second racist incident Mr. Davis has faced during the opening of the Monroe church. Several weeks before, a young man of about 25 rolled down his car window and began calling out racist epithets at him at the church entrance. Mr. Davis said, ''I just stood there, thanked God for the grace he has brought to my life, and refused to be brought down to his level.''",NANCY DONIGER,"FEB. 28, 1999","For One Church, a Matter of Miracles",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/for-one-church-a-matter-of-miracles.html
"For Microsoft's witnesses at its antitrust trial, the simple words of introduction have become deeply unnerving. ''My name is David Boies, and I represent the United States.'',It is no wonder the big software company's witnesses have come to fear facing Mr. Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, in the Government's sweeping antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation. Time after time, he has caught Microsoft witnesses off guard as the words from their mouths on the stand contradict the statements in internal Microsoft documents or in their own E-mail.,Yet as both sides have now presented their main evidence, with the last of Microsoft's 12 witnesses having finished on Friday, the question remains just how much the company has been merely embarrassed or truly damaged in the courtroom.,The answer, legal experts say, is by no means as clear-cut as might be suggested by the daily reports of Microsoft's miscues. The recent drift of significant rulings in antitrust cases, they note, tends to be pro-defendant as the courts have been generally reluctant to second-guess business decisions.,''Boies has done an excellent job, but the outcome of this case is still in doubt,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ''There is enough flexibility in the doctrine of antitrust and enough uncertainty about how the case law applies to a dynamic, high-technology industry like computer software that it could go either way.'',Put simply, the Government's case is that Microsoft illegally used its monopoly power to thwart the challenge to its dominance posed by Internet software, stifling competition and innovation.,The 57-year-old Mr. Boies -- known for his rumpled blue suits, for his uncanny memory and for having defended I.B.M. in a marathon antitrust case -- has clearly put Microsoft through a humbling courtroom experience.,He rattled a senior Microsoft executive by pointing out misleading aspects in a videotaped demonstration he introduced as evidence. He confronted Microsoft's economic expert with his earlier writing, which seemed to contradict his testimony, and the befuddled witness said, ''What could I have been thinking?'',Last week, after Mr. Boies seemed to dismantle another Microsoft executive, forcing him to retract some of his testimony, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson joked as a Microsoft lawyer took over that the task before him was a ''heroic endeavor.'',In the courtroom, Mr. Boies (pronounced BOYZ) is trying to undermine the credibility of Microsoft's witnesses, which is a central element in the Government's legal strategy. Attacking Microsoft's credibility, antitrust experts say, helps reinforce the strongest parts of the Government's current case -- a case that suffered a setback a month after it was filed last spring.,The Government sued Microsoft last May in a complaint that focused mainly on the Internet browser market. It contended that Microsoft bundled its Internet browser to the company's industry-standard Windows operating system in an illegal attempt to hobble a promising challenger, Netscape Communications, the pioneer in software used to browse the World Wide Web. Microsoft replied that its Explorer browser and Windows were not two products but a single product, and that Microsoft could put anything it wanted to into Windows.,A Federal appeals court essentially agreed with Microsoft last June in a separate but related case. The court said Microsoft had the right to fold a browser into its operating system as long as it could make a ''plausible claim'' of consumer benefit.,After the appeals court ruling, the Government added evidence to flesh out the allegation in its original complaint that Microsoft was engaged in a ''pattern of anticompetitive behavior.'' By the time the trial began in October, the Government's roster of witnesses included not only Netscape's president, but also executives from Apple, I.B.M., Intel, Intuit and Sun Microsystems. In one episode after another, they testified, Microsoft was a monopolistic bully, using its power as a club against other companies to try to curb competition and divide markets.,Microsoft denies each allegation, saying that its accusers are a collection of its rivals trying to portray routine business meetings in the software industry as something sinister.,These allegations all center on private meetings -- some more than three years ago -- involving Microsoft and other companies. The court must sort through the written evidence and the witness testimony to decide whom to believe.,''What happened at these meetings are we-said, they-said disputes,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ''That's why the Government has tried so hard to go after the credibility of Microsoft's witnesses in general.'',The credibility strategy is also an effort by the Government to bullet-proof any lower-court ruling from appeals. No one can predict with certainty how Judge Jackson will rule in this nonjury trial.,His questions, comments and even rebukes to Microsoft witnesses may indicate that Judge Jackson leans toward the Government. But regardless of the verdict at Federal District Court, the case will almost surely go to the Federal Court of Appeals and perhaps to the Supreme Court.,Judge Jackson could certainly be overruled on matters of evidence and law. But legal experts say it would be very difficult to reverse him on findings of fact based on credibility. ''The judge can say I looked all these witnesses in the eye and I don't believe them,'' noted Mr. Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.,The Government has amassed a lengthy list of allegations. They range from trying to get rivals to divide markets to pressuring personal computer makers and Internet service providers to agree to exclusionary contracts that unfairly curb competition. Still, to rule in favor of the Government, the courts must decide that some of Microsoft's actions were clear-cut violations of the antitrust laws and not merely what one antitrust scholar called ingredients in a ''stew of unsavory behavior.'',Microsoft, legal experts say, has certainly been able to raise doubts about some of the incidents. The Government, for example, contends that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape to divide the browser market at a pivotal meeting on June 21, 1995, an offer Netscape declined. Based on the courtroom testimony and reams of E-mail evidence, the executives of the two companies left that meeting with sharply differing views of what occurred.,The legal hurdle in attempted collusion cases, antitrust experts say, is fairly high. The key case, they say, is a 1984 ruling involving American Airlines Inc. In a tape-recorded phone conversation, Robert Crandall, American's president, tried to persuade the president of Braniff Airlines to jointly raise their fares 20 percent on flights from Dallas. A Federal appeals court ruled against American, finding the evidence ''uniquely unequivocal.'',The Microsoft-Netscape meeting, antitrust experts say, does not seem to rise to that unambiguous standard of evidence. ''I doubt that charge will hold up,'' said Mr. Kovacic of George Washington University.,Microsoft insists that most of the credibility attacks on its witnesses are on issues not central to the case. For example, Mr. Boies got Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to say he could not imagine what he was thinking when he wrote in a 1982 Harvard Law Review article that ''persistent excess profits'' suggest that a company has considerable market power -- contrary to his testimony that Microsoft's enormous profits are not an indication of monopoly power.,The next day, Microsoft's lawyer pointed out a footnote in a 1982 article in which Mr. Schmalensee noted that extremely high profits could be explained by owning a ''unique and long-lived asset.'' A particularly valuable intellectual property, like Microsoft's Windows, could qualify as such an asset, Mr. Schmalensee said.,''Are we sorry he did not go to the footnote on the first day?'' said William Neukom, a senior vice president and general counsel of Microsoft. ''Sure we are. It gave David Boies a moment of drama, and it dominated the news stories of the trial that day. But it does not affect the factual record of the case, not one whit.'',Most legal experts believe that the strongest part of the Government's case is the allegation that Microsoft's restrictive agreements with computer makers and Internet service providers, combined with financial incentives to favor Microsoft's products, unfairly put Netscape at a disadvantage to thwart competition. ''The evidence that Microsoft constantly placed hurdles to make it more difficult for consumers to choose Netscape looks quite strong,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading antitrust litigator.,Microsoft's legal strategy is to try to focus the court's attention on the outcome in the marketplace, not on Microsoft's inflammatory E-mail or contract details. And Microsoft argues that many of its contract restrictions have since been eased.,''Whatever those arrangements were, whatever measure of exclusivity they created for a period of time, Netscape was able to gain a substantial number of new users,'' said Richard Urowsky, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing Microsoft. ''There was no foreclosure of consumer choice.'',The courtroom battle will be silenced for a while. Judge Jackson declared a six-week recess because of scheduling conflicts with other cases. In mid-April, the case resumes as each side can call three rebuttal witnesses, followed by final arguments. A verdict is expected in the summer.",STEVE LOHR,"FEB. 28, 1999","For Microsoft, Humbled May Not Mean Defeated",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/for-microsoft-humbled-may-not-mean-defeated.html
"To the Editor:,Re ''Fix the Independent Counsel Law'' (editorial, Feb. 25): The way to avoid politics in the decision of whether to appoint independent counsels is to create a permanent office with limited personnel and budget, constrained by law to appropriate topics and targets.,Under this system, the independent counsel would be selected by a three-judge panel, but the panel would be selected by both the Administration and by the opposing leadership in Congress. He would be appointed as soon after the election of a President as possible and be given a tenure extending not more than six months after the President left office.,The independent counsel would also be required to file regular reports to the panel of judges, the President, the Attorney General and Congressional judiciary committees regarding the status of his investigations.,RALPH E.

They find them frighteningly predictable, as well as just frightening, like these monster children in John Carpenter's remake of ''Village of the Damned''($17.99 at Blowout Video in Manhattan). Mitzi Spallas, the children's groomer on the shoot, used a little KMS Styling and Setting Gel ($5.50 at Naimie's Beauty Center, [818] 655-9922) to rough up Shawn's bowl cut.,2. Metal desks from the 30's through the 50's were called ''tankers'' because of their indestructible nature. At Sonrisa, in New York and L.A., the tankers are stripped of rust and paint, coated with semigloss finish and sold for between $1,680 to $2,100.,3. This was Verena Waldstaetten's first modeling job. She is from Vienna, and she spent a year working as a nanny for her boyfriend's sister in Topanga Canyon. On the shoot, all the models ate hearty eggplant sandwiches and large chunks of brie, while puzzling over the jumbo size of Los Angeles women, especially since Los Angeles is infested with gyms.,4. Two dogs attended the shoot: Richie, a sweet Scottish terrier who lives with the photographer, and Audrey, a reporter's papillon puppy, who spent much of her time in Kelly McCool's lap. Kelly is from London, but refuses to go home because her Shih Tzu would have to be impounded for six months. (The Labor Government is expected to repeal this archaic quarantine law next year.) Neither dog was wearing a Baxter collar, out this month from Vuitton, $240. At select Louis Vuitton stores; call (800) 285-2255.,5. There were no apples on the caterer's table for Brody McFarland to munch on, but there were plenty of cupcakes, including the ones that Elizabeth Stewart brought, made with Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake mix and Pillsbury Cheesecake frosting, which Elizabeth maintains -- even if the photographer disagrees -- are the best in the world.,6. Susan Kare, who designs desktop icons for Macintosh, is making icon T-shirts for kids. These (a) are $16 each at Mudpie in San Francisco. The Chinese-print dungarees (b), $76; call (800) 977-7736. Stride Rite has been making the iconic Mary Janes (c) for 80 years, $38. At Great Feet in Manhattan.,7. Fashion illustration is Michael Roberts's usual gig. But he went off the beaten path to make the fabulous paper collages in ''The Jungle ABC'' (Hyperion/Callaway, 1998; $19.95).,8. In case you were wondering what were they thinking, a few words from: (a) Tristan Webber, who calls this his chakra suit and says, ''I was thinking about color theories and the body's energy systems''; (b) Rei Kawakubo, who believes that ''extreme simplicity means undesigned''; and (c) Issey Miyake, who says: ''A piece of cloth was our original springboard. This season we bring this essential root to the present.'',9. No fashion set would be complete without ''coffins,'' also known as wardrobe trunks. ''I don't like to use that term,'' says Ross Cooper, president of Travel Auto Bag of Manhattan, which has been selling the cases, now $250, since 1933. ''My customers call and say they need a coffin and I say: 'Why? Aren't you feeling well today?'

"Like a house, a dish is only as sturdy as its foundation. The vegetables upon which a stock, sauce or soup is constructed add nuance and depth to food. They also have the ability to bring out the intensity of each subsequent ingredient in a recipe. What are these miracle workers?,It depends on where you are. Many Western cooks, for instance, begin with a mirepoix, a base that typically consists of diced onions, carrots and celery. This trinity was developed in the 18th century by a cook to the Duc de Levis-Mirepoix, a French ambassador. Its simplicity is deceptive: the celery primes the human yen for salt; the carrot does the same for the sweet tooth; and the onions hit the bitter- and, when cooked long enough, the sugar-sensitive parts of the tongue.,In addition to tweaking certain taste receptors, bases like a mirepoix define the character of a dish. In northern European countries, for instance, carrots, onions and celery are common. Sofrito, the Spanish-style mirepoix, contains onions, garlic, chili and sweet peppers, and it can be cooked slowly with (or without) smoked ham. In the Caribbean, the same onion-garlic-and-peppers mixture is cooked leisurely in lard with annatto seeds, which lend a deep yellow hue to the fat.,When simmered at a snail's pace until tender and mellow, these flavor amalgams not only provide structure to a dish but also give it a geographical definition. And certain spices mark the spot. The lingering scents of onions, garlic and, say, ginger root summon Asia, specifically Hong Kong. Dishes from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand tend to include lemongrass, lime leaves and occasionally minced galangal or turmeric root.,The importance of a sturdy foundation should never be underestimated. A strong base note is indispensable to cold-weather cooking. In winter the yearning for roasted, caramelized flavors is most pronounced. Perhaps this hankering is atavistic. Sweetness once signaled high calories and warmth. Caramelized notes are also linked to the crusty finish of cooked meat, which in winter we have more of an appetite for. In the gray cocoon of this season, these foundation flavors promise security and hope. Now we can begin.,Rock-Shrimp-And-Merguez-Sausage Gumbo,1/3 cup vegetable oil,5 tablespoons unsalted butter,2/3 cup flour,1 pound merguez sausage or other spicy sausage, cut into  1/2-inch pieces,2 cups chopped yellow onion,1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced,3 thinly sliced scallions,4 cloves garlic, minced,1/4 cup minced parsley,1 teaspoon dried thyme,3 bay leaves,1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper,2 teaspoons kosher salt,1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper,8 cups (2 quarts) homemade or low-sodium chicken stock,2 pounds shelled, cleaned rock shrimp,2 tablespoons gumbo file powder (see note),Cooked white rice, enough for six servings,Tabasco sauce for serving.,1. Combine the oil and butter in a large, heavy kettle and place over medium heat. When the butter melts, gradually stir in the flour. Lower the heat slightly and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture turns darker than peanut butter but lighter than chocolate, for 10 to 15 minutes.,2. Immediately add the sausage, onion, green pepper, scallions, garlic and half the parsley. Cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Stir in the thyme, bay leaves, cayenne, salt and pepper and cook 1 minute more. Add the chicken stock, adjust the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour.,3. Add the shrimp to the pot and return the mixture to a simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the file powder and the remaining parsley. Let set for 5 minutes. Serve in deep soup bowls over white rice with Tabasco on the side.,Yield: 6 servings.,Note: Gumbo file powder can be bought at Dean & DeLuca (877) 332-6946.,Steamed Duck With Pineapple,1 2-inch piece ginger root, peeled and sliced wafer thin,1 medium onion, peeled and roughly chopped,5 cloves garlic, peeled,1 tablespoon coarse sea salt,1 4 1/2-pound duck,2 tablespoons vegetable oil,1 pineapple, peeled and cored,3 tablespoons Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam),1 tablespoon sugar,2 cups boiling water,2 red Thai chilies, seeded and thinly sliced,1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper,1/4 cup coriander leaves.,1. In a food processor, combine half of the ginger, onion, garlic and sea salt and process until the mixture forms a coarse paste. Pat the mixture over the skin and inside the cavity of the duck. Place the duck in a large, nonreactive bowl, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.,2. In a large, heavy-bottomed kettle, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the duck and cook, turning frequently, until all sides are deeply browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer the duck to a plate and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the oil left in the kettle.,3. Slice the pineapple into  1/2-inch rings and halve each ring. Return the kettle to medium heat and add the pineapple, fish sauce, sugar and remaining ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pineapple is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.,4. Return the duck to the pot and add the boiling water, chilies and pepper. Adjust the heat, cover and simmer until the duck is cooked to the desired doneness, about 45 minutes for medium. Transfer to a platter, surround with the cooked pineapple and some of the juices in the pan and carve. Garnish with coriander leaves.,Yield: 2 to 3 servings.,Short Ribs Braised in Dark Beer With Gingered Carrots,(Adapted from Eberhard Mueller, Lut ce, New York),2 tablespoons vegetable oil,4 trimmed short ribs (2 1/2 to 3 pounds total),Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste,2 tablespoons flour,1 small onion, diced,2 medium carrots, diced,1 stalk celery, diced,1 small leek, trimmed, well rinsed and thinly sliced,1 tablespoon brown sugar,2 12-ounce bottles (3 cups total) dark beer (Guinness or similar),3 cups veal stock, or homemade or low-sodium beef broth,Zests of half an orange, removed with a vegetable peeler,Zests of half a lemon, removed with a vegetable peeler,1/2 cinnamon stick,1 sprig thyme,1 tablespoon softened unsalted butter,Gingered carrots (recipe follows) for serving.,1. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. In an ovenproof and flameproof casserole dish large enough to hold the ribs in a single layer, heat the vegetable oil over high heat on top of the stove. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and dust them with 1 tablespoon of the flour. When the oil just starts to smoke, place the ribs in the casserole and sear on all sides until golden brown.,2. Remove the ribs from the casserole and pour off all but about 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the onion, carrots, celery and leek to the casserole and return it to medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are browned and caramelized, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the brown sugar and cook until the sugar is melted.,3. Return the short ribs to the pot with the vegetables and add the beer, stock, orange and lemon zests, cinnamon stick and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover and place in the preheated oven. Cook the ribs until very tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. (Check the ribs after 10 minutes to see if they are still gently simmering; if not, raise the temperature slightly and check 10 minutes later.),4. Remove the ribs from the casserole and set them aside. Strain the casserole liquid through a fine-mesh sieve, discard the solids and return the liquid to the pan. Bring to a simmer and use a spoon to skim off as much of the fat as possible. Cream together the remaining tablespoon of flour and the butter and whisk it into the liquid. Simmer, uncovered, until it is reduced and is syrupy enough to coat the back of a spoon, 20 to 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.,5. When ready to serve, return the ribs to the sauce and cook until they are just heated through. Transfer the ribs to deep plates, spoon sauce over them and surround with gingered carrots.,Yield: 4 servings.,Gingered Carrots,2 tablespoons unsalted butter,1 tablespoon sugar,1 teaspoon kosher salt,Few grinds black pepper,1 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch julienne strips,2 small shallots, minced,1 pound (about 10) medium carrots, trimmed, peeled and sliced on the bias into  1/4-inch slices,1 tablespoon minced parsley.,1. In a saucepan set over medium heat, combine the butter, sugar, salt and pepper. When the butter melts, add the ginger and shallots and cook, stirring, until they are softened but not browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the carrots and stir until they are coated with the butter mixture.,2. Add 1 cup of water to the pan and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan, adjust the heat and simmer until the carrots are just tender (they should still have a bite), about 5 minutes. Season to taste with more salt if necessary, and stir in the parsley. Serve warm with short ribs braised in dark beer, above.,Yield: 4 servings.",MOLLY O'NEILL,"FEB. 28, 1999",Food; Stock Options,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/food-stock-options.html
"TAKE a frying chicken, cut it up, saute it, and you still have a blank canvas. Unlike a succulent roast chicken, which can stand on its own with little adornment beyond salt and pepper, a sauteed chicken requires help. It is a chameleon, ready and able to change its personality and even its color in the pan.,An exotic taste of Morocco calls for lemon and olives. China relies on ginger and snow peas, and for Mexico, some chilies and a splash of tequila do the trick. All these dishes are simple and quick to make. The chicken with lemon and olives is excellent with steamed couscous on the side. For the other two, rice is all you need.,Chicken With Lemon And Olives,Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes,1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,1 frying chicken, cut up and patted dry,1 medium-size onion, finely chopped,2 large cloves garlic, minced,1/2 teaspoon paprika,1 teaspoon ground cumin,2 lemons, quartered, pits removed,12 green olives, pitted,1/2 cup dry white wine,Salt and freshely ground black pepper,1 tablespoon minced fresh mint leaves.,1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof skillet. Add the chicken pieces and cook over high heat until nicely browned. Do not crowd them in the pan. Remove them as they are browned.,2. Lower the heat, add the onion to the fat in the pan and saute until tender. Stir in the garlic, paprika and cumin, cook another few seconds, then add the quartered lemons. Increase the heat to medium high and cook until the quarters start to soften. Stir in the olives and wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned particles.,3. Return the chicken to the pan along with any juices that may have been released by the chicken as it sat. Baste the chicken pieces with the pan juices and season with salt and pepper.,5. Cover and cook about 40 minutes, basting once or twice. When the chicken is done, check seasonings, then sprinkle with mint and serve.,Yield: 4 servings.,Chicken With Ginger And Snow Peas,Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes,1 tablespoon peanut oil,1 frying chicken, cut up and patted dry,1 tablespoon minced shallots,2 tablespoons finely slivered fresh ginger,3 cloves garlic, minced,1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder,2 tablespoons dark soy sauce,1/2 cup rice wine or dry sherry,Salt and freshly ground black pepper,4 ounces snow peas, trimmed,2 tablespoons finely chopped scallions,1 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander.,1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof skillet. Add the chicken pieces and cook over high heat until nicely browned. Do not crowd them and remove them to a bowl as they brown.,2. Lower the heat and add the shallots, ginger and garlic. Saute for a minute or so, then stir in the five-spice powder, soy sauce and rice wine or sherry.,3.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof skillet. Add the chicken pieces and cook over high heat until nicely browned. Do not crowd the chicken pieces in the pan and remove them as they brown.,2. Lower heat, add the onion and red pepper and saute until tender. Add the jalapeno and pine nuts and saute for a minute or so, then stir in the chili powder. Add the tomatoes, tequila and lime juice.,4. Return the chicken to the pan along with any juices that may have been released by the chicken as it cooled.

"The choreographer Paul Taylor and the filmmaker Matthew Diamond, a former dancer, got together at Mr. Taylor's house in lower Manhattan on a Sunday afternoon last month to talk about ''Dancemaker,'' Mr. Diamond's documentary that goes backstage with Mr. Taylor and his dancers. It opens on March 3 at Film Forum, to run concurrently with the Paul Taylor Dance Company's 1999 two-week season at City Center. ''Dancemaker'' was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary, and Mr. Diamond also received a Directors Guild nomination.,Here are excerpts from their wide-ranging conversation.,MATTHEW DIAMOND. -- Actually, we've never sat down and talked about the film, have we? We never have sat down and talked about the process since the first day.,PAUL TAYLOR. -- Well, you had this outline, didn't you? It was sort of general. You didn't know what the story would be.,DIAMOND -- No, I knew it would involve you. We knew that it would involve, obviously, the work. We knew it would involve the company. We also knew that it would be about this extraordinary world you've built around yourself -- the company, and how unique it is.,TAYLOR -- Hey, did you know we went through several other directors? I got all these documentaries to see what kind of documentary I liked, and what I didn't like. And I looked at six or eight of them. But I always wanted you, because I knew you.,DIAMOND -- Right. From the ''Dance in America'' programs. (Mr. Diamond directed two programs of Mr. Taylor's work for the PBS series.),TAYLOR -- Yeah. I trust you. You wouldn't do some terrible thing. And I remember in the beginning, before work started, that we agreed that it wouldn't be a fluff piece.,DIAMOND -- Yeah, well, it's not a movie that says what a great guy you are. You want just an honest portrait.,TAYLOR -- It needs a little tension somewhere.,DIAMOND -- Yeah. And I think I said: ''And we have to take a look at all the sides of the company. Good and bad.'' And you said to me, ''Well, it's just one great big family.'' And I said: ''Oh yeah, what's your family like? Because I'll tell you what my family is like!'',After a while, we sort of had real carte blanche to go anywhere we wanted with the cameras. Did you get tired of us being around?,TAYLOR -- No, I got used to you. You sort of kept out of the way. I found it, after a few days, very easy to forget you were there.,DIAMOND -- I realized when I walked in the studio that we were going to be able to shoot the dance from this very unique point of view. I really wanted to see the rehearsals from your point of view and from the dancers' point of view. Literally. Underneath their legs. Where they sit. Where they stand. I realized that because you don't work with mirrors in your studio, there was never a danger that the audience was going to see the camera and sound people. Otherwise we'd have been dodging our own image all the time. Why don't you have mirrors?,TAYLOR -- Well, I'm their mirror. Dancers often get a habit of looking at themselves in the mirror while they're dancing, and that isn't always where you want their heads turned. So if it's a matter of line, I correct them. They don't need mirrors.,DIAMOND -- One of the results is that nobody in your company ever has what I always call ''mirror eyes.'' That sort of removed self-assessment you can see in lots of them.,TAYLOR -- It can look a little egotistical.,DIAMOND -- When we went in to shoot you doing ''Piazzolla Caldera,'' the new dance, we could see you think. We could see you struggle. We could see you come up with stuff.,TAYLOR -- Well, that sequence is kind of embarrassing to me. I couldn't think of any steps. I was just standing scratching my head for a while. Right? Nothing was happening for a long time there.,DIAMOND -- Well, I'm looking at you from across the room and I was on a headset to the cameraman, and I'm saying: ''You see, he's picturing the ballet in his head. I'm going to ask him about that.'' And so when I said to you, ''You picture the ballet in your head?'' you looked at me with this look of horror on your face. Like, ''Who is this idiot asking this question?'' Right? What's interesting to me is at a certain point you want to get at the act of creation. Like if you can't get finally down to the core of creation, almost, what's the point of the company? What's the point of the movie? What's the point of anything? And we get there, and you're sitting there saying, ''Gee, I wish I knew.'',TAYLOR -- Well, that's the thing about the so-called creative process and inspiration and all that. It's inexplicable. There have been books and books and books written about these things. And they can't quite get it. Things just click sometimes. You get these ideas, and that's it.,DIAMOND -- And it just comes into your mind and then you recognize it, and you go, ''Ah! Well, I'll hold on to that one.'' And then lots and lots and lots of others come to me and I go, ''No, not interesting. Seen it before. Don't want to go there.'' And then there are happy accidents. Did you feel when you finally saw the film, ''Oh my God, here's a mirror held up to the whole thing?'',TAYLOR -- No.,DIAMOND -- And how about seeing yourself?,TAYLOR -- Well, I have a little trouble relating that way to me. Somehow I'm on the outside looking at that other guy. And, he seemed like, I'd like to know you better, you know? Maybe.,DIAMOND -- I can introduce you, by the way.,TAYLOR -- I know it's me there. You know, it's a reflection. But overall, looking at the film from beginning to end -- there's a lot of that guy that's not there, of course. You can't in, what, an hour and a half? But what is there, yeah, I'd like to know that guy.,DIAMOND -- That's so funny. How did the dancers respond? I so wanted to be there when you showed it to them and then I wasn't.,TAYLOR -- Well, you have to remember, Matthew, I don't know how film people are, but I think dancers don't often like themselves when they see themselves on film or video. When they move it feels different than it does when they watch themselves doing it. Something is missing. I didn't really talk to them about it. I haven't heard any complaints.,DIAMOND -- I remember when I used to see myself dance on videotape or film and I would hate it. It's the same experience as hearing your own voice on the answering machine.,It's funny. I think the stage manager said, ''Do you know what my favorite part of the film was?'' And I said, ''What?'' She said: ''Me. I love myself. I look great; I sound great. You got my story. I couldn't be happier.'' And I thought, ''Oh, good.'',We said, ''We're only going to do this film if it's O.K. with everybody.'' As if anybody would say, ''No, it's not O.K. with me.'' But I think they were all O.K. I know I said to them, ''Look, the only thing I can promise you, because I've never made a documentary, is that I have done every job in this company.'' Not in this company, but I was an understudy, I was a corps dancer, I've been a soloist. I've been a choreographer. I ran a dance company. I helped manage it. And I'll try and tell the truth. I said, ''I just want to go everywhere, any time I want. Please don't hide from me.'' And they were really great, but they did say: ''You know what? We don't want to be seen nude.'' Or not without a very, very, very specific permission.,Lots of the dancers are so articulate about their experience, about what they feel. About what they're going through. They can really put it in words, which I find remarkable. Lots of dancers are not. I love dancers, but they don't always develop that side of their brain.,TAYLOR -- I think a lot of them spoke very well.,DIAMOND -- One of my frustrations in making the film is that normally when I direct -- television and other films -- everybody does what I tell them to do. If I say: ''That was pretty good. Let's do it again. Move the lights over there. You know what? Deliver this line differently. Let's do another take of that phrase of the dancing.'' Directing a documentary, I was sort of in the position of trying to choose when something exciting was going to happen two months in advance, and then waiting for it to happen, and hoping we were pointed in the right direction. It's been frustrating, because I can't just go: ''Hey, wait a second. Why don't you two have a fight?'',TAYLOR -- The editing of the dancing just is fabulous. I was very, very pleased. Of course, they're not just shot from the front like the audience sees them, but that's not what we were after.,DIAMOND -- Right. We were trying to re-express it in another medium. That's all. It's different demands.,Now here's a question which I have been pondering as I read your autobiography, ''Private Domain.'' We all spend our lives thinking about ourselves. And you put that onstage, to some extent, sort of disguised. Whereas in autobiography, it is clearly: ''I woke up. I went to school. I then had a terrible love affair.'' And now on film it's almost a kind of biography on you and the company.,TAYLOR -- I don't think the work is expressing anything about myself personally. I'm looking around at what I'm seeing. I'm not trying to do autobiographical dances, that's not my thing.,DIAMOND -- To me it's much more comforting to wake up in the morning and know you have a job to do. I have to make a film. I have to make a television show. And so when we were working, and I saw you talk about this kind of like, ''Well, I wake up in the morning and I know I have to go and make a dance.'',TAYLOR -- Yeah. It's a job.,DIAMOND -- Just the job you happen to have. I find that very comforting. The idea of craft.,TAYLOR -- Yes.,DIAMOND -- Almost more than art.,TAYLOR -- Right. You try to talk about creativity, but in craft you have structure and form.,Hey, whatever happened to that wonderful footage you took of all my wonderful awards and doctorates and honorary doctorates and statuettes and everything? Nothing. How is anybody going to know how wonderfully I have been acclaimed?,DIAMOND -- That's funny, you know. We cut a big sequence where you're saying, ''I won this doctorate and I got this MacArthur Fellowship.'',TAYLOR -- Did I do that? Oh, I was showing you my award room. There's no more room on the walls in my award room.,DIAMOND -- I know. Exactly. And we cut it. That was when the film was three hours long. There was no way in the world I was sitting through three hours.,TAYLOR -- Well, that would have tended toward the puff stuff, wouldn't it?,DIAMOND -- Absolutely. I didn't want a film where here's this really great guy. He's had these really great accomplishments. And these really lovely dancers who all get along so lovely and no tension, no difficulty.,TAYLOR -- But did we really have to have me firing everybody?,DIAMOND -- You know why I put that in? Because when I looked at that stuff -- and there's you firing somebody. And another time you fired the whole company, and there's a story about it.,TAYLOR -- You mean, on Christmas Eve?,DIAMOND -- Yeah, the famous Christmas Massacre.,TAYLOR -- Yeah.,DIAMOND -- Did you know it was called that ?,TAYLOR -- No.,DIAMOND -- I revealed all your secrets to you.,TAYLOR -- Well, that was years ago.,DIAMOND -- I always thought what's unbelievable is that when the rubber meets the road, you're not fooling around. This is a hard job and you either meet the standards or you don't. No hard feelings. That's it. And I think that's why the company ends up being good. But it's not a game. It's not playing around, and it ain't frou-frou. It is a dead serious job, and it's hard to do. So I love the sequences that scare people, when they realize, ''Oh man, he is a tough guy.'',TAYLOR -- Well, you don't like to tell people that, because you make them nervous.,DIAMOND -- But what we do in this country is we take an art form and force it into the shape of a business. It is a separately extraordinary accomplishment from having just made the dances.,TAYLOR -- Well, I can't tell you a thing about the business. Someone has always been there to do that for me. It's been wonderful.,There'll probably be some complaints about the smoking in that documentary. I don't encourage my dancers to smoke. If some of them want to, who am I to say?,DIAMOND -- There are a number of sequences of you choreographing for Francie Huber, and there's one where the two of you stop and light up a cigarette. And it's really great. And you turn to her and you say, ''You know, what they don't tell you is that this stuff helps you think.'',It's not in the final film. But I thought: ''Oh my God, this is perfect. We could take this sequence and then just go get funding from Philip Morris for a new ballet.,TAYLOR -- Where did you get all that old footage of me dancing?,DIAMOND -- Out of the Paul Taylor Dance Company archives.,TAYLOR -- I don't remember seeing some of that.,DIAMOND -- I had had this idea about one of the things that exists in a sense in every rehearsal. You created a ballet and then, let's say, you're the lead solo in ''Aureole,'' and then for a while Elie Chaib did it, and then at some point Nureyev might have tried it. And at another point maybe Chris Gillis or somebody else danced it and now Patrick Corbin has the responsibility of maintaining this and someday perhaps passing it on to somebody -- and all those ghosts in the studio of all these people here, gone.,TAYLOR -- That dance is too long, if you ask me. Everybody dances ''Aureole'' too long. But you stuck through it. The whole thing is in there. Why didn't you cut some of it?,DIAMOND -- It's one of the few things we didn't make any internal cuts in. And I feared that it was too long, and I knew that I liked it. The first time or two that we cut it together, it was just the footage of you and of Patrick.,TAYLOR -- Right. The old codger watching this lovely young dancer do his old solo. That's nice. That's nice.,DIAMOND -- So somehow it resonates with the audience in a way that made me think, ''I don't think I'll touch this.'',TAYLOR -- That's a whole story right there.,DIAMOND -- It helps when you're doing these documentaries to be irreverent, if you're working with somebody who you know is irreverent. And you feel like you're totally in the zone.,TAYLOR -- Well, you're making your thing. You're not just recording my dances.,DIAMOND -- No, I'm not trying to. That's not my job. My job, really, it's the audience. Because the audience one day is going to pay eight bucks a ticket. That's who I'm concerned with. And preferably, not the audience that already comes to dance performances, you know, because I sort of assume -- or hope -- that they're going to be along for the ride anyway. What I'm interested in is telling this story to people who might not have heard it before.,TAYLOR -- I do think all that aches-and-pains sequence is a little long. I mean, it's not that bad. It seems to reflect on, ''Oh, these poor dancers. This Taylor is making them do these movements that are just crippling them.'' It makes them think I'm putting them at risk, you know.,DIAMOND -- Well, you know, so much of what the audience sees when they go in the theater is: ''Wow! Isn't it wonderful? Boy that must feel great!'',TAYLOR -- That's how it's supposed to be. You're popping their bubble here.,DIAMOND -- Well, I kind of want to. I want to say: ''They're breathing hard, they're sweating bullets, they wake up in the morning and they're in pain, but you know what? It feels great.'' I mean, this is both true Periodically it struck me that it's not an accident that I was making this film during what I call the Oprah Era. Which is the reveal-all era, you know. We not only dance and it feels great, but we dance and we argue with each other and we dance and we have muscle aches and pains and we sit there and then you film the feet soaking in cold water. Well, arguably it does go on too long.,TAYLOR -- Well, I just hope I'll be able to get some new dancers for the company some day.,DIAMOND -- Let's talk about our most difficult times.,TAYLOR -- All right Matthew, what were yours?,DIAMOND -- I told you part of my most difficult thing was not being able to walk in the room and tell everybody what to do. It was really hard for me. I'm in the habit of being very bossy.,TAYLOR -- You surmounted that problem very well. I don't remember you being bossy at all.,DIAMOND -- No, no. I never said a word.,TAYLOR -- Let me tell you my most difficult thing. I found it very hard not to hit the cameraman when he crept onstage during the dress rehearsal. He got so involved in getting a good shot that he just came right onto the stage. I was trying to look at the dance. I don't want to see a cameraman there. But I controlled myself very well, didn't I?,DIAMOND -- You didn't hit him.,Oh, the other difficult time, was when all the India film fell off the truck. I started running backwards down the highway against traffic. Now in India there's no lights on the highways. Half the cars don't use their headlights. And I, as always, dressed in all black. And I thought, ''This is really a stupid way to die.'',But, you know the other moment -- a completely behind the scenes moment -- was when we all had a little tiff about the performance shoot at SUNY Purchase.,TAYLOR -- It was about money. The dancers had suddenly thought they should be paid like Hollywood movie stars. And I didn't think we could do that.,DIAMOND -- We had to edify them as to reality. And in the meantime you got very upset with them. And, I thought, rightfully upset with them, and you canceled the shoot.,TAYLOR -- And then I was out in the country and the dancers came knocking at the door -- there they were. They had gotten a car somewhere and drove all the way out there. And I didn't want to talk to them. And I said ''forget the whole thing.'' I came out for peace and quiet. And there they were. I wouldn't let them in. I said: ''Go back. Go away.'',DIAMOND -- Good thing you didn't have a shotgun.,TAYLOR -- And they just hung around and hung around. I was really sticking to my guns. Then they barged right in my house without being invited.,DIAMOND -- Oh, the nerve.,TAYLOR -- And they sat around trying to butter me up.,DIAMOND -- Well, it was an unhappy group of puppies.,TAYLOR -- Then they were very repentant. They knew they had overstepped.,DIAMOND -- Yeah. But, you know, in all fairness, they danced fabulously. And you'd have killed them if they didn't. Emotion was running very high during that shoot. But that was probably the toughest time. That, and then dealing with the phone call where I just had to say: ''Paul, I know this is something you don't want to do. But you gotta do this and I'm not taking no for an answer.'' And an hour later you agreed.,TAYLOR -- Oh, I knew we'd do the shoot all along.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",FILM; Training Cameras On Every Step A Troupe Takes,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/movies/film-training-cameras-on-every-step-a-troupe-takes.html
"IT is the next logical development in Hollywood high concept: the literary teen movie, bringing together young people and their Cliff Notes in a way that ends the need for all those dreary literary classics that clutter up the high school experience. Think of the possibilities! ''Clueless II: Why Anybody Would Read Jane Austen,''  ''Lolita: Summer Vacation!'' and ''I Still Don't Know What James Joyce Was Talking About Last Summer.'' For the younger crowd there would be the inevitable ''Ernest Hemingway Goes to Camp.'',It was just such an impulse that gave Roger Kumble, a 32-year-old former video store clerk, the inspiration for ''Cruel Intentions,'' which he wrote, and later directed, as ''Dangerous Liaisons'' in high school. The new film navigates the shiny surfaces of an Upper East Side world of Gothic brownstones and even more Gothic behavior. And as with ''Dangerous Liaisons,'' it is a place where sex is neither furtive nor fun: it is a weapon of mass destruction.,Significantly, the source of Mr. Kumble's bright idea was the 1988 film adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play, written by Mr. Hampton and directed by Stephen Frears. By the time Mr. Kumble came to Choderlos de Laclos's 18th-century classic, ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' it was on the order of reading a studio novelization. ''They're so mean and nasty in that movie,'' he says, ''I thought, 'This is really what high school is like: hurting people.' '',Ryan Phillippe, who stars as the film's Valmont, says: ''I really hope this isn't Cliff Notes for kids. But I don't think there's anything wrong with going back to a great piece of literature and saying, 'How can we apply this to our times?' That was one of the challenges of this movie. Things that were socially taboo in the 18th century aren't necessarily anymore. Kids are more sexual now. They just are. So I think we exchanged taboo for attitude.'',The same transformation had been pulled off in ''Clueless,'' Amy Hecker ling's stylish 1995 updating of Jane Austen's ''Emma.'' Mr. Kumble allows -- a bit grudgingly -- that without the success of that picture, his would not have been made. It came up again and again during meetings with the studio. ''They'd go, 'This is what Amy did with 'Clueless,' '' he recalls. ''And I thought, 'Well, whatever gets your movie made.' But I think mine's closer to the novel than she got with 'Emma.' '',Oh, Mr. Kumble did allow himself an occasional liberty with de Laclos's epistolary novel. The careful reader will search in vain for where it is written that the wicked Marquise de Merteuil, played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, informs the virginal Cecile (Selma Blair) that she is going to demonstrate for her precisely -- very precisely -- what it means to get to ''first base.'' And does. By this time, Mr. Kumble has wheeled in for a close-up that is more clinical than lascivious.,The demonstration is delivered with the erotic charge of a particularly detailed set of Ikea instructions, and in Ms. Blair, it is met with the sort of cloddish, adolescent enthusiasm that is the opposite of sex. ''It was my first time kissing another girl, and, you know, girls can be so judgmental,'' Ms. Blair says of the scene. ''I care much more about what women think than men, so I really wanted to impress her.'',Ms. Gellar's sub-zero chill in that scene, and through most of the film's nasty fun, concealed the actress's mounting alarm at her own transformation from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' -- platinum-tressed defender against the undead and the dark root -- to social vampire. Ms. Gellar is playing the sort of person whose heart she might gladly drive a stake through on her show. And though she had balled up her tiny fists and declared, ''I'm not Buffy!'' during her first meeting with Mr. Kumble, there were certain lines of dialogue at which Buffy got huffy. ''You're known for being a certain way,'' Ms. Gellar says of her perky Buffy persona, ''and there were a couple of days at first when I felt like, I'm just not sure I can say this.'',For his part, Mr. Phillippe wasn't sure he would take on the role of Valmont -- though not, as one might expect, because of John Malkovich's daunting performance as a roue in the film a decade ago. No, Mr. Phillippe offers, his reluctance was based on the fact that, as he puts it, ''I have little sisters.'',For months before filming began, the actors met at Mr. Kumble's house to work out pesky problems brought on when the story was modernized. In one scene, 14-year-old Cecile ''essentially gets raped,'' says Ms. Blair, who plays her part with a kind of goony charm. ''But somehow she puts a happy face on it, so it's not as painful to watch.'' Mr. Kumble's goal, he says, ''was to take a terribly uncomfortable scene and make people laugh. And then make them feel bad that they're laughing.'',The biggest problem was that there was nothing to laugh at in Valmont, the character Mr. Malkovich had made indelibly and heartbreakingly funny through the sum of his nasty parts. This new Valmont suffered the curse of all modern leading men: he had to be likable. ''I think when you do a period piece, it's easier for the characters to be less likable,'' Mr. Kumble asserts, ''because there is kind of a distance.'' Reese Witherspoon, who plays the demure role once filled by Michelle Pfeiffer -- and who is romantically involved with Mr. Phillippe in real life -- made her feelings about the character known to Mr. Kumble early. ''It was nearly impossible to like him in the first version,'' she says of Valmont.,In the end, Mr. Phillippe's conventional good looks, not to mention the gorgeous '56 Jaguar roadster convertible in which he cruises around Manhattan, should help insure his acceptance by high school audiences. ''Some of the stuff that didn't end up in the movie was a lot harsher, a lot more original, and there was less emphasis on the romance,'' says Mr. Phillippe, sounding resigned. ''In studio terms, romance is heroism, and I think the idea was that if love and romance prevailed, you'd kind of forgive some of the seedier aspects. But that's the way it always is. There's always this dilution process.'',Throughout the filming Mr. Kumble clung to two ideas: one, that  ''Dangerous Liaisons'' in high school could work, and two, that without so much as a music video to his credit he was the man to direct it. Mr. Kumble, who grew up in Harrison, N.Y., attended public high school there and abetted his video clerking with other humble jobs like paperboy and bellhop. This, despite the fact that his father, Steven Kumble, was managing partner of a prominent Manhattan law firm.,After graduating from Northwestern University in 1988, Mr. Kumble was determined not to follow his father into the law, so he headed off to California and immediately set about writing screenplays. Five years later he wrote a mean-spirited play about Hollywood, ''Pay or Play,'' which chronicled his frustration with the studios that would not make his movies. This, of course, led to several screenwriting offers. ''Theater was more of a calculated move,'' Mr. Kumble says. ''I'd be lying if I said it was my great love for the stage. It was more of a way of getting my work seen.'',He followed that with a second play, ''d-girl,'' about low-level studio development executives. It starred David Schwimmer, of ''Friends,'' and became such a hit that the very Hollywood moguls Mr. Kumble was skewering were fighting to get into the 99-seat theater. ''And in typical Hollywod fashion, they all wanted reserved seats,'' he says. ''The whole point of both plays was to lure people in and then midway through, attack them and make them feel really bad. The great thing about theater is that you can be as mean as you want, and it's like a roller-coaster ride that people can't get off.'',Determined to seize his moment, Mr. Kumble went to Mexico after ''d-girl'' closed, and two weeks later returned with the script for ''Cruel Intentions.'' He taught himself how to direct by renting every laser disk he could find with a director's audio commentary track and listening to them over and over again. ''The Criterion School of Directing,'' he says, referring to the commentary-rich Criterion Collection series. ''I wholeheartedly believe in it.'',Mr. Kumble says he is trolling amazon.com for his next literary adaptation, and he may already have hit upon a way to add to this expanding genre of de Laclos. ''The story exists on its own,'' he says. ''You could do 'Dangerous Liaisons' in space.'' Or not.",BRUCE NEWMAN,"FEB. 28, 1999",FILM; Can't Read the Classic?

"IN the opening moments of the satirical teen comedy ''Jawbreaker,'' a voice-over narrator rhapsodizes in breathless Valley Girl tones about her high school in-group of arrogant teen-age beauties known as the Flawless Four.,''Everyone wanted to be them,'' she gushes. ''You know them. They went to your high school, too. They totally ruled!'',As she speaks, the regal foursome, wearing skintight dresses and high heels, struts into view. Rounding a corner in a corridor lined with shiny metal lockers, the four ooze the snooty hauteur of pampered princesses who have never accepted the word ''no.''  ''Jawbreaker'' is the latest in a slew of high school comedies aimed at the bulging demographic blip of millennial teen-agers. Already we have had ''Varsity Blues'' and ''She's All That,'' each of which has gobbled up nearly $50 million at the box office. Opening Friday is ''Cruel Intentions,'' an upscale Manhattan teen version of ''Dangerous Liaisons'' that has much in common with ''Jawbreaker.'' After that come ''American Pie'' and ''Ten Things I Hate About You.'',A cursory look at the high school movies that have opened or are about to open might reinforce the cliche that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Now as in the 1950's, the decade that invented the modern teen-ager, the American teen movie portrays high school as a brutal social and sexual testing ground whose pecking order puts handsome jocks and pretty cheerleaders at the top and relegates misfits, nerds and arty types to social serfdom. More than ever, the senior prom is an event capable of inducing trauma in the girl who is either uninvited or forced to go with a date less desirable than Prince Charming.,But if the broad outlines of the basic high school drama remain intact, there have been some significant changes inside the picture. More than 40 years after he was invented by James Dean in ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' the stock image of the teen-age rebel hero -- the sexy mixed-up kid searching for his identity -- has begun to fade from the center of teen mythology. In movies as in pop music, the focus of attention has shifted from boy power to girl power. On the pop music charts, Alanis, Jewel, Mariah, Janet, Brandy, Monica and Lauryn rule under the watchful eye of their mentor and role-model, Madonna. But in the movies, much more than in music, the messages being conveyed about girl power are decidedly mixed.,The typical male hero of a late-90's teen comedy tends to be a bland, idealistic athlete-scholar whose bright future is clouded only by a few minor problems. In ''Varsity Blues,'' James Van Der Beek is a good-looking A-student in a football-obsessed Texas town who becomes an overnight star when he replaces the injured quarterback on the high school's championship team. Not even a girl offering herself in a whipped-cream bikini can keep him from following a straight and narrow path to a full scholarship at Brown University. His main act of rebellion is standing up to the team's racist, megalomaniacal coach.,In ''She's All That,'' Freddie Prinze Jr. plays a modern-day Pygmalion who, on a nasty bet, transforms the geekiest girl in his senior class (Rachael Leigh Cook) into prom queen material. Mr. Prinze's flawed but likable hero is so blandly nice he barely exists on the screen. But Ms. Cook's character, a bespectacled intellectual painter, political activist and amateur performance artist, radiates intelligence and spirited independence. Instead of swooning into the arms of the dreamboat who has deigned to pay her court, she becomes his mentor, introducing her conformist high-school jock with a heart of gold to worlds he never knew existed.,The ruthless female leading characters in ''Jawbreaker'' and ''Cruel Intentions'' are downright scary in the way they view boys as trophies. Ryan Phillippe, who plays a teenage Don Juan in ''Cruel Intentions,'' is no match for Sarah Michelle Gellar playing the vengeful, coldly promiscuous class president of an elite private school in Manhattan.,Among the scores of forerunners of these new teen movies portraying girl power, two stand out. ''Carrie'' (whose sequel is about to be released) opened the door in 1976 with its ferocious portrayal of female adolescent peer group cruelty and telekinetic retaliation. The movie helped spawn an entire genre of female-oriented teen horror movies, from the ''Halloween'' series through ''Scream.'' More recently, ''Clueless,'' a clever contemporary adaptation of Jane Austen's ''Emma,'' set the mode of adapting a piece of classic literature for the teen movie market.,But as girls seize the reins of power in high school movies, alarms are going off. The leader of the Flawless Four in ''Jawbreaker'' is a cold-blooded psychopath who manipulates her cronies into covering up the accidental death of a friend in a sadistic 17th-birthday ritual. When the film's narrator describes her as ''Satan in heels,'' she isn't kidding. Ms. Gellar's character in ''Cruel Intentions'' is equally vicious, the power-mad incarnation of two words that are bandied about a great deal in teen movies: bitch and slut. In ''She's All That,'' the prom queen (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) whom Mr. Prinze's character deserts for Ms. Cook's made-over nerd is similarly monstrous.,The underlying message seems to be that teen-age girls, having finally been given license to swear like truck drivers and sleep with whomever they want, deserve to be punished. Being born beautiful means being born bad. Only ugly ducklings who have turned themselves into swans have a right to be happy.",STEPHEN HOLDEN,"FEB. 28, 1999",FILM; A New Rule: The Beautiful Are the Bad,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/movies/film-a-new-rule-the-beautiful-are-the-bad.html
"Even in midwinter, the 26,000-acre Turtle Lake Club here in northern Michigan is beautiful.,A large clubhouse of hewn logs and a dozen spacious cottages sit on a snow-dusted meadow by the mile-wide private lake. To the north is an expanse of cattail marshes. To the west and south are miles of dark green forests of fir, spruce and northern white cedar. And to the east lies a large wood of aspen and oak, the branches denuded by winter and the clearings roamed by small groups of deer browsing for forage.,This sylvan paradise has become the unlikely subject of a bruising legal battle. On one side are the club's 19 members, powerful industrialists united by a love of blood sports. On the other side is a newly elected State Attorney General, a Democrat, who accuses the club of illegally building 30 miles of fence around the property this winter.,Watching warily from the sidelines are Michigan's dairy and beef cattle farmers. They are terrified that their herds may be infected by the recent spread of bovine tuberculosis among the wild deer in the area, the first such sustained outbreak ever documented in North America and a potentially serious threat to the Midwestern livestock industry.,State officials contend that the Turtle Lake Club's fence will make matters worse by disrupting deer migration and confining the deer to a lightly hunted area, allowing the tuberculosis to spread faster. The club has contended that the woven-wire fence is needed to keep out trespassers and that deer can leap the fence, ranging from four to eight feet high.,Both sides insist that they will not back down. ''Wealthy landowners have to obey the law in the same way as everyone else,'' the Attorney General, Jennifer M. Granholm, said in an interview.,James A. O'Toole, the club's lawyer, said that the club would keep fighting despite having lost the first round in court a week ago, when a local judge issued a preliminary injunction barring the erection of any more fences but allowing the club to continue putting up fence posts. ''We intend to litigate the matter to its conclusion,'' Mr. O'Toole said.,State officials and local residents say that club members include the current and former chief executives and owners of some of Michigan's largest companies, including Roger B. Smith, the former chairman of General Motors, and Robert J. Eaton, the co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler. Neither was available for comment, their spokeswomen said. Other members include chairmen and tycoons from the oil, department store and truck trailer manufacturing industries.,State officials first became aware of a bovine tuberculosis problem in upstate Michigan in late 1994, when an emaciated buck was shot on the Turtle Lake Club's property and was found to have the disease. Infected deer have been found since then in five counties, as cases crop up farther and farther away from the club.,Bovine tuberculosis is caused by different bacteria from those that cause human tuberculosis. But people can become sick with it by drinking unpasteurized milk from an infected cow. The bovine disease can weaken and kill livestock.,State officials and academic biologists say that while the Turtle Lake Club may not be directly responsible for Michigan's outbreak, this area's many hunting clubs made the outbreak possible. The clubs have fed truckloads of corn, sugar beets and other food to deer each winter for years so that fewer deer would die of starvation. This has meant more animals to shoot in hunting season.,Wild deer tend to stay fairly dispersed as they forage for food. But deer crowd together at food piles, touching noses and breathing on one another, spreading tuberculosis, said Harry A. Jacobson, a professor emeritus of wildlife at Mississippi State University and one of the world's foremost authorities on deer.,Until now, the world's only documented, sustained outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis in wild deer were in New Zealand. The disease has recently begun spreading to cattle here, with infected animals having been found in three small herds. All 173 animals in the three herds have been destroyed, said Daniel J. Wyant, Michigan's director of agriculture.,Wisconsin has restricted shipments of cattle from Michigan and some slaughterhouses in Chicago are turning away Michigan livestock. Federal and state officials have begun a program to test for tuberculosis in every cow, steer and bull in an area of northeastern Michigan the size of Connecticut.,It is impractical to wipe out the roughly 250,000 wild deer in this area, and tourism related to deer hunting is a bigger industry in Michigan than the $1 billion dairy and beef industry. So the state is banning all feeding of deer and barring the construction of fences that enclose deer. The hope is that if wild deer revert to their previous roaming and feeding patterns, the disease will gradually disappear.,The hunting clubs have complied with the ban on feeding and the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in wild deer has leveled off at a little under three percent. But the Turtle Lake Club triggered the legal tussle by starting to build its fence last month.,Rebecca A. Humphries, chief of the wildlife division at the Department of Natural Resources, came last autumn to this town 200 miles north of Detroit to ask that the club not build a fence. But state officials heard on Jan. 25 from one of the club's neighbors that fence construction had begun.,Within hours, the state began aerial reconnaissance of the secretive club's land, which covers an area twice as large as Manhattan.,The state has sued the club, and the litigation has quickly turned into an odd quarrel over how high deer can jump. State guidelines for private deer farms recommend 10-foot fences. According to the state's lawsuit, most of the club's fence is 8 feet, while some stretches are only 4 to 6 feet. So the club has maintained that its fence is not a deer fence.,State officials strongly disagree, and have retained Scott R. Winterstein, an associate professor of wildlife at Michigan State University who has studied the deer here using radio collars. Professor Winterstein said that few deer would try to jump the eight-foot fence, while does with fawns would not even try the four-foot fences. The club's fences are a serious problem because they are likely to increase the prevalence of tuberculosis within the club while still letting occasional infected animals escape, he added.,Many deer tracks were visible this afternoon in the snow along both sides of a two-mile stretch of eight-foot fence, but none of the deer appeared to have jumped the fence. ''They'll come right up to the fence but not over the fence,'' said Elaine Carlson, a state biologist, as she studied the snow.,Trespassing is a problem here. Sipping coffee at the local diner at dawn today, five men all grudgingly acknowledged having fished or hunted without permission on the club's land at least once.,State lawyers see another motive for the club's fence. ''What they've done is try to capture all the winter herding of deer on their property and fence them all in,'' said Christopher D. Dobyns, the assistant attorney general for natural resources.,Mr. O'Toole, the club's lawyer, declined to comment on the case.,The club has few defenders here. Much of the land was logged in the 1800's, then sold to wealthy families in Detroit and Chicago, leaving a few infertile tracts for the farms and villages. This is one of the poorest areas of the Midwest. Hillman's 630 residents have a median household income that is just one-third of the national median. Yet the Turtle Lake Club is fighting its annual school tax assessment, and schools here may have to cut costs drastically.,Regardless of how the outbreak began, many farmers are upset by the club's actions. Galen H. Schalk, whose family has raised dairy cows here since the 1940's, said that he had found infected deer on his farm, and his son shot a coyote at the barn and learned later that it was infected.,''It's on your mind every day,'' Mr. Schalk said. ''If one of my cows is infected, the whole herd goes.''",KEITH BRADSHER,"FEB. 28, 1999",Fenced-In Deer Stir Dispute Over Bovine TB,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/fenced-in-deer-stir-dispute-over-bovine-tb.html
"Within hours after youths passing by a Juarez drainage canal on a recent day discovered the body of a 13-year-old girl, the most recent victim in a long series of sexual killings here, Esther Chavez Cano was rushing to spread the dismal news.,She was on the phone to members of the feminist organization she heads. She was typing E-mail messages to congresswomen and journalists. And in news interviews, Ms. Chavez, a 65-year-old former accountant for Kraft Foods, was accusing the new Governor of Chihuahua of breaking campaign promises made last year to investigate the killings of women in Juarez more seriously than his predecessor did.,''It's outrageous that these murders have been used to win votes, but the minute the politicians get in power they forget about the dead women,'' Ms. Chavez said.,The victim, Irma Angelica Rosales, was raped and smothered with a plastic bag on Feb. 16, hours after she lost her $4-a-day job in an American-owned factory. She became the third such victim in this border city that faces El Paso since Gov. Patricio Martinez Garcia took office in October.,But a grisly trail of similar crimes preceded Miss Rosales's killing. Authorities have counted 184 women killed in Juarez since 1993. About 80 were raped and their bodies dumped in the desert. State officials say only 24 fit a pattern of serial sexual murder, but Ms. Chavez, who keeps detailed lists of the dead on her home computer, says she believes the figure is far higher.,Just a few years back, as battered female bodies turned up here frequently, dumped in desert gullies and vacant lots, these crimes gained little notice. Even now, few of the killings have been solved.,But this latest killing provoked considerable outrage, which is a testimony to Ms. Chavez's outspoken advocacy and the fledgling feminist movement she helps lead.,Juarez newspapers made the young woman's death front-page news. Television editorials urged authorities to stop the violence. Demonstrations have been scheduled to protest the killing. As outrage grew, Governor Martinez offered a $5,000 reward for information identifying the sexual predator.,The continuing sexual murders pose a challenge to Governor Martinez, who is a member of President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party. He won election last year partly by lambasting his predecessor, from the opposition National Action Party, for investigative mismanagement.,[Arturo Gonzalez Rascon, Chihuahua's Attorney General, said his government had made prosecuting the murders a priority. New initiatives, including restrictions on liquor sales and beefed-up police patrols, have reduced crime, and a shake-up of the unit investigating homicides in which women are the victims has increased efficiency, he said in a letter responding to written questions.,[''We've made good advances,'' he said. In response to Miss Rosales's  killing, he said. ''We've assigned our best elements to its investigation.'',[But on Wednesday there was a setback when two Mexico City criminologists invited to Chihuahua to help out by the Martinez administration resigned in protest, asserting  that the sexual homicide inquiries are in chaos, with case files and lab tests missing and inexperienced detectives in charge.],''Governor Martinez told us that he'd appoint better investigators, but the officials he's named are worse than those they replaced,'' Representative Alma Vucovich, president of the Mexican Congress's Committee on Sexual Equality, said in an interview. ''The bodies keep appearing and neither the Governor nor the police seem to care.'',Many victims, like Miss Rosales, had migrated to Juarez from cities to the south. She arrived in January, moving into a mud shanty with her brother. He paid $20 for a false document stating that she was 16, enabling her to get an assembly job at the plant where his wife worked, Electrocomponentes de Mexico.,She had trouble adjusting to factory discipline, and on Feb. 10 was suspended for a day for talking. On the morning of Feb. 16 she quit her job, plant officials said, but her sister-in-law said Miss Rosales told her in a tearful conversation at the plant that she had been dismissed.,''Go straight home on the bus,'' the sister-in-law said she told Miss Rosales. ''Don't walk, its dangerous.'' The teen-ager left about 9 A.M.,Two youths found her body six hours later in a ditch a mile away after she had been raped and killed.,Dozens of young factory women have been attacked walking through Juarez's desolate industrial parks, and Ms. Chavez's organization has urged owners to provide secure transportation.,Thomas Creevey, an executive at the International Wire Group, based in Mishawaka, Ind., which owns Electrocomponentes, said the plant provided no bus service. He called Miss Rosales's salary ''confidential,'' but her relatives said that during seven days of work she earned $27.,Ms. Chavez heard of the killing hours after it occurred, when a television crew came to interview her about it.,Ms. Chavez was about to retire from her accounting career about the time the sexual murders began here in the early 1990's, and dismayed by officials' indifference, she began to speak out.,She drew attention with criticisms of male investigators and politicians, who argued that women were inviting attack by wearing suggestive clothing. She attacked machismo, whose roots in a Chihuahua culture that glorifies ruthless desert horsemen who force women into submission may make it even stronger than elsewhere in Mexico. She became an advocate for working-class women whose brutalization was passing unchallenged to a degree inconceivable had the Juarez dead been drawn from a higher station.,''She seemed very audacious,'' said Guadalupe Ramirez Lopez, director of a Juarez human rights group, who recalled seeing the short, slender Ms. Chavez stand to criticize a state prosecutor in 1995. ''She was the only one daring to demand better investigations.'',Her criticisms of the official inquiries have been widely accepted. Chihuahua officials recently acknowledged that the state police have never even assembled a psychological profile of the serial killer or killers. That may change. The Federal Bureau of Investigation agreed this month to send profilers to Juarez to study the case, a spokesman in El Paso said.,Despite the increasing uproar, the Chihuahua police remain sloppy and indifferent, Ms. Chavez said. She cited the experience of Armine Arjona Baca, a physician, who told her story in a separate interview.,During the night of Jan. 31, Dr. Arjona heard the screams of a woman in terror and pain coming from a canal behind her house, and phoned the state police. The officer who answered argued that it was not his agency's job to respond to emergencies but promised, grudgingly, to send a squad car. It never arrived. Dr. Arjona called back 30 minutes later. ''Is that woman still screaming?'' the agent responded, irritated, Dr. Arjona said. A woman's body was found later that day elsewhere in Juarez. It is unclear whether the cries Dr. Arjona heard came from the murder victim.,Miss Rosales's killing threw Ms. Chavez's life into tumult as the teen-ager's family reached out to her for help.

"On television, wrestling sells, sells big. Monday night's ''WWF Raw'' on the USA Network is a top-rated cable program with millions of viewers each week. But are viewers drawn to precision maneuvers, artful pins, athletic excellence? Uh, not exactly. Turn on the show for 30 seconds and you'll see behavior far more, well, indelicate: crotch-grabbing, obscene gestures and on down the ladder of taste.,Far too indelicate, it would seem, to be a fit subject for statistical analysis. But as living, gut-crunching proof that nothing is safe from scholarly probing, the small-screen tabloid ''Inside Edition'' commissioned an Indiana University study of a year's worth of ''WWF Raw.'',So if you're titillated by pro wrestling, gape on. If you're disgusted, keep surfing. If you're a parent, worry. A third of viewers are 17 and under, and many schoolchildren imitate the obscene behavior.,But if you're a data freak, a feast awaits, including the exact number of times a crotch was grabbed, incidences of satanic activity, scenes of wrestlers appearing to urinate as well as categories too offensive to list. Plus the number of minutes out of a two-hour telecast typically devoted to wrestling: 36.,The study does not, by the way, say how many former pro wrestlers have been elected governor (1) or how many times Garrison Keillor, on his weekly radio show, ''Prairie Home Companion,'' has poked fun at that Governor, Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.

"Having chased away (or at least forced underground) murderers, burglars, robbers, drug traffickers, car thieves, muggers, panhandlers and squeegee men, New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has turned his attention to drunken drivers.,Mr. Giuliani, who has seldom met a crime pattern he thinks he cannot smash, ordered the police to begin seizing the cars of nearly anyone arrested for drunken driving, whether hard-core repeaters or first-time offenders. And to make sure that New Yorkers understood that he was very, very serious, the Mayor said that even for those acquitted in criminal court of driving while intoxicated, the city might still pursue the permanent confiscation of their cars in civil court.,That led The Financial Times, hardly a journal of the left, to say that New York was ''fast becoming the Singapore of the West.'',Mr. Giuliani's goal, of course, was to shock people into changing their behavior. If you want to drink, he said, just make sure you don't drive.

The Supreme Court has generally upheld the use of forfeiture by Federal and state prosecutors, who have tried to inhibit the drug trade by charging traffickers with criminal violations while also seizing their assets in civil actions.,Still, there are legal questions. Is it appropriate to confiscate a car upon arrest rather than conviction? Is it fair to seize the cars of drivers with  unblemished records? Is the punishment too varied, since one motorist could lose a car worth $40,000 while another might forfeit one worth $1,000?,Questions like these will no doubt keep the courts busy over the next few months.

"It was a beautiful, springlike day in early December, and as Ruth Lippin sat in an examination room at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, waiting for her very interesting brain to be scanned in the adjoining neuroimaging suite, she gazed out the window and took in what was once for her a bloodcurdling scene: the Hudson River, the Jersey Palisades drenched in sun and, looming in the middle distance like a nightmare hammered together out of rivet and steel, the George Washington Bridge. There was a time not too long ago, the 39-year-old Lippin said cheerfully, when the mere thought of crossing that bridge in an automobile filled her with extreme dread, a physiological immersion in fear most of us can only imagine.,''Somehow I figured out how to get the phone number of the 24-hour control booth for the bridge,'' she said, still dismayed by the depth of her anxiety and embarrassed about the ingenuity it inspired. Lippin -- a mother of two, a lawyer and now a Manhattan therapist who treats people with phobias -- recalled the lengths to which she used to go to avoid getting stuck in traffic on the bridge. ''I would call them, and I'd say, 'I know this sounds crazy, but I'm in a car and I'm anxious about crossing the bridge in traffic and want to know if it's clear or not.' And if it wasn't, then I wouldn't go over.'',That is the disabling equation of anxiety disorders: irrational fear equals irrational behavior. If Lippin went ahead and then got out there in the middle and couldn't move, she feared, she would feel trapped and threatened and then might do something, well . . . crazy. In fact, she did sometimes get trapped, but she never did anything crazy. Yet people with panic disorders spend their lives avoiding situations because they're afraid of something that never happens.,Ruth Lippin had other fears too. Back in 1987, after she had diligently studied law for three years, she was plunged into total dread when she heard the news that she'd have to take her bar exam in Brooklyn, which to her meant choosing one phobic nightmare or another -- bridge or tunnel. Later, in an attempt to overcome her fear of subways, she repeatedly rode the 1, 2 or 3 train with a friend, yo-yoing up and down the West Side of Manhattan for hours like Pynchon's Benny Profane, so that she could go to work like everybody else.,As we spoke, a Columbia-Presbyterian technician, Manuel de la Nuez, probed for a vein in her right arm and inserted an intravenous line, which would deliver a radioactive isotope that would illuminate her brain's activity during a positron emission tomography, or PET, scan. Then a group of researchers ushered Lippin into the cramped working area of the PET scanner. Like other research groups, the Columbia team, headed by Dr. Jack Gorman, a psychopharmacologist, is using the latest high-tech imaging tools to study what fear, worry and obsession actually look like under the skull, what parts become active when a fear takes hold, how its intensity and its duration may vary from person to person. These psychiatric researchers -- this term was largely oxymoronic until a generation ago -- are looking at the effects of drugs and even some forms of psychotherapy to see what works on fear and to begin plotting more exacting methods of treatment.,For more than a century, scientists have pondered the nature of fear and anxiety, and how they cause the physical symptoms that contribute to so much human suffering. Anxiety disorders, officially categorized only in 1980, include panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Taken together, they are the most common mental illnesses in the country, affecting more than 23 million Americans. Recent epidemiological studies by Ronald C. Kessler of Harvard Medical School suggest not only that their prevalence is greater than previously thought, but also that many people suffer from more than one disorder at the same time, often accompanied by depression.,In the past few years, researchers like those at Columbia have begun pointing their increasingly powerful imaging machines at the brain to study these disorders and, thanks to the groundwork laid by a spectacular decade of research on fear in animals, have an excellent idea about where to aim. Lippin, for example, is a participant in a scientific study of the brain's circuitry of fear before and after the use of antidepressant medication, cognitive behavioral therapy or both. Like other subjects in the study, Lippin had been treated with both a drug (Zoloft in her case) and cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder.,Psychiatrists, neuroscientists, even cognitive psychologists are all using the new tools to take our understanding of the biology of fear to a higher level. In an explosion of new research, every aspect of fear is being scrutinized, measured, recorded and mapped out. Recent studies at Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, have provided graphic evidence that phobics and people with post-traumatic stress disorder tend to display unusual activity in the brain's fear centers, experiencing their fears more intensely than normal subjects. An as-yet-unpublished study by researchers led by Jill M. Hooley at Harvard has offered preliminary evidence that the fear circuitry becomes activated when subjects hear tapes of a parent criticizing them. As a result of these and other preliminary studies, doctors are approaching the day -- not soon, but foreseeable -- when imaging machines may ultimately reveal a broken psyche with as much routine precision as an X-ray shows a broken bone. In addition to suggesting new avenues of treatment, the research is lending inadvertent support to a very old interpretation of the brain -- namely the Freudian notion of unconscious fears -- although neuroscientists prefer not to view it that way.,Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, has taken an especially prominent role in promoting an alliance between basic neuroscientists and psychiatric practitioners in the study of anxiety disorders. Although Hyman sometimes likes to deride what he sees as the indiscriminate use of M.R.I. and PET scans as a high-tech form of phrenology, with their point-and-shoot approach to pretty but inconsequential pictures of the brain, he makes an exception when it comes to the biology of fear and anxiety. ''I've been pushing the basic scientists and the clinicians together because I think the research in this area has been exemplary. . . . The animal model has identified a number of circuits in the brain. Already, we're getting away from a phrenological view of the brain. If you look at a lot of human brain studies, they basically say, 'This part of the brain lights up, that part lights up. . . . ' That's phrenology. Here we have a template for thinking in a much more sophisticated way about how the brain works.'' Understanding this circuitry, Hyman says, will ultimately lead to diagnoses and treatments of unprecedented precision.,Such research is already shedding light on Ruth Lippin's battle for normalcy. Anxiety is ultimately an isolating condition, and it is somehow appropriate that she experienced her first panic attack in, of all places, the middle of a farm field in Holland, on a teen-age tour of Europe. It was the summer of 1976, and she was visiting a Dutch family in the country. She can picture the little farmhouse in the midst of acres of fields. She remembers cows. She remembers a banal conversation with her Dutch hostess that nevertheless took her, without warning, to an abyss she has since visited time and time again.,''We were sitting out in the middle of a field,'' she recalls. ''Just vast. I remember the vastness. I suggested getting together with my friends that evening, and she said she didn't go out at night, and it definitely triggered a feeling of isolation and not having control over the situation. And then'' -- she pauses at the memory -- ''there was that huge adrenaline rush. Just this sense of being in very serious danger. Then the sweating, the heart palpitations and the sticky palms. It reminds you of what you feel like at the end of an aerobic workout. You're exhausted. That's why people with panic disorder walk around in a perpetual state of exhaustion.'',That and the enervating fear that, out of the blue, it will happen again.,Some fears are stark and immediate; others simmer in the brainpan, warmed by imagination and worry. A number of years ago, my father, my brother, Eric, and I were camped on a lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, on the border between Minnesota and Canada. After a day of fishing, we had retired for the night, the three of us arrayed in our sleeping bags. As usual, my brother and I were unable to sleep because of a persistent rhythmic guttural sound: my father's snoring. This went on for some time, until Eric finally got exasperated and said, ''Dad, pleeeease stop snoring!'' To which my father replied, ''I'm wide awake.'' Which led all of us to simultaneously ponder the source of the sound that had been keeping us up.,We nervously peered outside the tent at -- and I'm sure there will someday be research claiming that fear sometimes causes visual exaggerations -- the largest black bear I've ever seen, standing on his back legs, swatting at our food pack, which we had shrewdly suspended from the branch of a tree. Not so shrewdly, however, we had selected a tree about three feet from the entrance to our tent. A family friend who experienced a similar close encounter put it best: ''Now I know the difference between anxiety and fear.'',I'll get back to that bear, but first a little detour. Although I didn't know it at the time, we had managed to pitch camp in a century-old debate about the nature of emotion, which started with a very smart observation by William James, the 19th-century American philosopher. James was among the very first thinkers, along with Charles Darwin, to seriously ponder the nature of emotions in general, and of fear in particular, from a scientific perspective. (It turns out that James was also a closet phobic, terrified of being alone.) In an 1884 article in the philosophy journal Mind, he asked an unusually prescient question about the nature of emotion, using as an example a person's fear upon encountering a bear. Does he run because he feels afraid, or does he feel afraid after he has already started running? Put another way, does a person have time to think something is frightening, or does the reaction to fear precede the thought?,James concluded it was the latter, arguing that ''the bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as they occur is the emotion.'' Ever since, there has been a kind of chicken-and-egg debate in psychology and the neurosciences about what comes first: the conscious awareness of fear (or emotion) or the physiological trimmings that come with it, like a pounding heart and waves of adrenaline, the better to fight or flee. It turns out that the answers to that 19th-century question will undoubtedly influence our understanding, and treatment, of anxiety disorders in the 21st century.,It was another, more philosophic observation by James that strikes at the central paradox of modern anxiety disorders. ''The progress from brute to man is characterized by nothing so much as by the decrease in frequency of proper occasions for fear,'' James wrote. ''In civilized life, in particular, it has at last become possible for large numbers of people to pass from the cradle to the grave without ever having had a pang of genuine fear.'' Civilized life is so safe, James suggested, and humans have so much cognitive firepower, that they should be protected against the instinctual, feral fears that quicken the pulse of so many other creatures that prowl the earth.,Fear and its fellow traveler, anxiety, in some ways represent a hard-wired alarm system in the brain in search of genuine life-threatening dangers. We tend not to encounter mastodons, saber-toothed tigers and other predators that prowled the earth eons ago, and yet we, like all mammals, have been evolutionarily equipped to respond to such threats instantaneously. We still respond to danger signals, but more often than not we've come to associate danger with social predators and situations -- the boss at work, the intolerant mate, the teacher, the bully. It may also be one of the paradoxes of our age that we've created entire economies around activating this fear system under safe conditions in the form of theme-park rides and Stephen King novels and films that have us on the edges of our seats. It is as if an archival survival circuit in our brains has become a cathartic button that gets pushed at great profit, the center of billion-dollar economies based on the vicarious experience of life-threatening fear.,By the same token, the proliferation of phobias and panic disorders may represent the overreaction of a life-preserving neural mechanism to normal everyday social stimuli. Only by the wildest stretch of the imagination should the George Washington Bridge represent a threat to one's very survival. And yet imagination, especially about the future, is precisely the engine that drives so many human fears -- fear of the unknown, fear of nuclear holocaust and in recent years fear of contracting AIDS. As Joseph LeDoux, a prominent neuroscientist at New York University, put it, ''A rat can't worry about the stock market crashing.'' But we can.,''One of the things that is so important about having anxiety and fear is some understanding that there's a future,'' says Jack Gorman of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. ''Humans with generalized anxiety disorder -- that is always a disorder characterized by anticipation of future events. I don't know that a monkey is capable of that.'',It has been traditional to think about fear (and anxiety) as a battle ultimately waged between the rational and irrational minds, between human reason and animal fear. In all but the most dangerous circumstances, it is a battle that reason and rationality should win every time, as William James suggested, and yet the fact that 10 to 15 percent of adults in America suffer from some sort of anxiety-based disorder argues that exaggerated or irrational fear is a widespread feature of the modern condition.,However, that traditional version of the battle between the rational and irrational brain is being recast as an anatomical scenario that has everyone from psychopharmacologists to Freudian analysts excited: the experience of irrational fear and anxiety represents a battle between conscious ''autobiographical'' memory and unconscious emotional memory. Human experiments in just the past year have confirmed that fear travels in at least two distinct circuits in the brain, one of which threads its way through the higher, cortical (thinking) precincts of the brain and one of which seems to occur with lightning speed just below the radar of our awareness. As neuroscientists like to point out, the brain processes sights and sounds, including threatening ones, in milliseconds, while the simplest thought takes full seconds to develop.,Which brings me back to the bear in the woods, for in a curious way our actions (and reactions) that night loosely recapitulated the varieties of fearful experiences that can afflict the human mind. There was an initial surge of, if I may, Jamesian fear when we realized we were in danger. But then the rational part of my brain wheeled into action -- when a bear comes into your camp, it remembered, you should be able to shag it away by beating on a pan and making lots of noise. We proceeded to make a racket, and the bear slunk off into the woods. But it wasn't entirely deterred. We heard it pacing back and forth on the periphery of the camp, snorting and sulking, its bulk both snapping branches and rattling our nerves, leading to a different stage of fear: worry.,And then, at some point during the night, the sound of the bear moving back and forth on the periphery changed. It sounded as if it was coming closer. In fact, it was coming closer, in a big hurry. In a fine group rendition of the fight-or-flight response, we all leapt to our feet and, with racing hearts and surges of adrenalized motion, jumped into our canoe and paddled as if our middle name were Evinrude. We spent the rest of a very long night listening to the bear devour everything from buttermilk pancake mix to cans of Spam.,That was in 1971. Now imagine that all the back and forth that had gone on inside our heads, that debate between fear and reason, could be recast as a dialogue between parts of the brain, and that those parts had names and belonged to an increasingly well-defined circuit, and that you could begin to see the dialogue unfold in an imaging machine. Imagine further that some people, because of a genetic predisposition or the quirk of personal brain chemistry, might later have anxiety attacks when they saw a can of Spam, or become phobic about camping. Finally, imagine that the sheer act of imagination -- powered by the greatest cognitive machine in the history of evolution, the human brain -- could activate the same circuitry of fear as a charging bear. That is precisely what many neuroscientists have begun to think when it comes to irrational fears in the brain, and all neural roads seem to run through a thimble-size bit of brain tissue known as the amygdala.,Although I didn't fully appreciate it at the time, I had the rare privilege of seeing Joseph LeDoux's amygdala kick into overdrive when I went to talk to him about his research on fear. We were walking down a street near Washington Square on our way to lunch one day, when out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science at N.Y.U. slowly hunker down into something halfway between a cringe and a crouch. Edging ever so slightly closer to the wall, he kept a wary eye on a small boy coming from the opposite direction. The boy happened to have a rather large boa constrictor draped around his neck and over his arms, and LeDoux happens to have a fear -- a deep, ingrained fear -- of snakes. ''That's what I'm afraid of,'' LeDoux said.,More than any other researcher, LeDoux has put the amygdala -- two nubbins of neural tissue (one on either side of the brain) -- at the center of what he calls the Wheel of Fear. Located near the center of the skull, the amygdala belongs to an archaic part of the brain, a part found in birds and reptiles, often referred to as the ''limbic system,'' although LeDoux doesn't much care for the term. It has long been associated with emotion, especially fear. There are a handful of patients in the United States and Europe who have totally lost the use of the amygdala. While they are not, as might be expected, fearless, they do display subtle social quirks, according to Ralph Adolphs of the University of Iowa, like an unusually trusting manner and an inability to recognize fear in other people's faces.,LeDoux is not the only biologist to have homed in on the amygdala. Bruce Kapp of the University of Vermont started by studying one of the signature aspects of fear, changes in heart rate, and worked back to the brain. Beginning in 1979, he focused on the part of the brain stem that controls heart rate in rabbits. Following the nerve filaments like a spent fuse back into the brain, he discovered that these fibers lead to the amygdala. Not only that, they also lead to a small hive of related nerve cells in the amygdala, a bit larger than the head of a pin, known as the central nucleus.,What was found to be true in rabbits, and later in rats, now appears to be true in humans as well. The central nucleus is the part of your brain that instantaneously looses the hounds of fear when you hear a loud bang, feel an earthquake, see Alan Arkin lunge for Audrey Hepburn that last time in ''Wait Until Dark.'' Nerves running out from this little knot of excitation carry the messages that control heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, respiration, freezing, increased jumpiness -- all the engines that get revved in a fearful situation. But the wiring doesn't stop there. Other nerve fibers from the amygdala thread their way back (or ''project'') into the upper parts of the brain, to regions that control the release of stress hormones (which may play a major role in the reign of irrational fears), to the cortex and to sensory areas. So when a threat occurs, when imminent danger needs to be sorted out right away, alarms go off throughout the brain -- and a result of this richly thatched neural alarm system, says Kapp, is a very alert individual. ''One of our hypotheses is that a number of these projections enhance arousal; you open your sensory gates and process information more efficiently.'' So fear, in this telling, has a kind of distinctly modern responsibility: it instantly primes animals, presumably including us, to notice novelty and pay special attention to, indeed, the shock of the new.,Ledoux came at the amygdala from a different direction. He set up an experiment in rats known as fear conditioning, which works like this: You give the animal a tone, followed shortly by a mild shock, so that the animal is ''conditioned'' to have a fear response to the sound alone. Then you try to trace the circuit by which the brain converts the sound into a fear response.,Over the last decade or so, LeDoux and others have worked out this circuitry in lab rats step by step, each accreted detail sending a small ripple through the world of human psychology. His laboratory has been able to show that as soon as conditioned animals hear the tone that precedes a shock, the auditory information travels to a way station in the brain known as the sensory thalamus, an essential stop for any incoming information about the world, and then immediately continues on to the amygdala. In rats, a fear-inducing sound goes from the ear to the amygdala in 12 milliseconds -- that is, 12 one-thousandths of a second. Moreover, LeDoux says, cells in this corner of the amygdala, known as the lateral nucleus, ''learn'' and memorize the fearful stimulus with incredible rapidity and tenacity. The research suggests that all it takes is one terrifying experience to form a lifelong emotional memory, one that is extremely difficult to erase.,While LeDoux's lab has concentrated on this downstairs circuit, the laboratory of Michael Davis, now at Emory University in Atlanta after 29 years at Yale, has sketched out what might be considered the high road in the processing of fear, one that may more closely mirror the routine processing of fearful information in humans. It passes from the sensory organs, like the eyes and ears, and lingers in the cortex, where conscious memories are formed, before threading down to the amygdala. Davis has also tentatively identified a separate destination, called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which is heavily connected to the amygdala and seems to control chronic states of fear like anxiety and worry.,This may sound like a lot of dense neural cartography, but the significance for psychiatry, if the same dual circuitry pertains to humans, would be profound. It suggests that because there are two different neural routes to the amygdala, two different kinds of fear-related memory can form. Indeed, one of the most provocative things about LeDoux's circuit is where it doesn't go. It doesn't go to the thinking part of the brain first. And what that implies -- certainly in rats, and almost certainly in humans like Ruth Lippin -- is that we experience, learn and unconsciously commit to emotional memory many fearful situations, without ever being aware of what has triggered the racing heart and quick pulse.,One hallmark of a panic attack, for example, is that its victim cannot understand what has triggered such a powerful reaction. The implication of fear-conditioning experiments in animals is that we have a separate memory of a fearful stimulus, be it a bear or a dinner party, lodged in the amygdala, probably informed by things we have heard or seen but do not consciously remember. So it's as if we walk through the world half-blind, bumping into archival stimuli, things we never knew scared us, things that we can't consciously remember but that nevertheless set in motion inexplicable and disturbing sensations of dread. Freudian analysts who have followed the work of LeDoux and others have been quick to point out that neuroscience's version of unconscious fear, in the words of Dr. Jean Roiphe, a Manhattan analyst, ''strongly corresponds with the Freudian notion that it's indelible and never goes away.'',Indeed, the sheer amount of environmental information pouring into the brain at any given moment -- not to mention at terrifying moments -- is probably more than consciousness can keep up with. This notion underpins one of the most startling messages to come out of the neurosciences in recent years: that most of what the brain does occurs outside of, and inaccessible to, our awareness. ''Consciousness,'' says LeDoux, ''is the weird thing, the unusual thing.'',The big question, of course, is just how much delivering shocks to lab rats can tell us about human behavior. It clearly doesn't tell the whole story, everyone agrees, but it's beginning to tell us quite a bit. Just within the past year, the first returns from the neuroimaging suite support the idea that human fears and anxiety can form subconsciously. In a PET study just published, Dr. Ray Dolan of the Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology in London has demonstrated that in humans, as in LeDoux's rats, a fear-conditioning route bypasses the cognitive part of the brain. Elizabeth Phelps of Yale and her co-workers have also recently demonstrated that fear conditioning in humans activates the amygdala in the same way it does in rats.,And Paul Whalen, Dr. Scott Rauch and their co-workers at Massachusetts General Hospital recently reported a clever experiment confirming that humans can indeed activate their fear circuitry without ever being aware of it. The Mass General researchers used an approach suggestive of subliminal advertising known as ''masking''; they showed subjects in an M.R.I. machine photographs of fearful faces for a mere 33 milliseconds, followed by a longer, masking exposure to expressionless faces for 167 milliseconds. The subjects had no conscious memory of seeing the fearful faces, yet their brains unequivocally did; the amygdala lighted up even during the brief flash of a fearful face, but not afterward and not during the similarly brief exposure of a happy face. ''So it's a very fast and preferential way to get information,'' says Whelan. ''Anxiety is about hypervigilance, and this is a vigilance system.'',The animal work of LeDoux, Davis and Kapp has inspired neuro-scientists to explore fear in humans, and so when Liz Phelps asked if I wanted to be a subject in a fear-conditioning experiment, I jumped at the opportunity to go where only rats had gone before. ''I don't want to get into too much detail here,'' she said over the phone when we set up the appointment. But, she added, packaging informed consent into an understated aside, ''you may receive a shock.'',When I arrived at the Yale School of Medicine, I proceeded downstairs to the basement, where the imaging machine filled the M.R.I. suite with a slow, mechanical throb. Kevin O'Connor, one of Phelps's colleagues, attached electrodes to my left arm and to fingertips on my left hand. The latter would measure galvanic skin response, an indicator -- like heart rate or blood pressure -- of an instantaneous, almost involuntary fear response. The one on my arm could deliver a shock. The echoplanar M.R.I., meanwhile, would track activity in my brain.,The experiment was deceptively simple. Looking through a mirror above my head as I lay motionless in the tube, I would see a blue square projected onto a screen for exactly 18 seconds, then a yellow square for 18 seconds, then a sign that said ''Rest.'' ''You may receive a shock when the yellow square is on,'' Kevin's voice said over the intercom, ''but there will be no chance of a shock associated with the blue square.'' So blue was cool, but yellow was trouble.,They first took a series of M.R.I. pictures to establish the basic architecture of my brain. Then the fear experiment began. The first thing to appear was a blue square, with a digital clock counting down to zero. When the yellow square came on, I could almost feel electrons surging like Mongol hordes down my arm toward the electrodes on my fingertips. But nothing happened, and then the ''Rest'' sign came on.,The same thing happened during the second cycle of blue, yellow and rest, and by the third cycle, it occurred to me that maybe I should inform Kevin that the shock electrode didn't seem to be working. By the fourth cycle, I finally began to realize (duh) what was going on: nothing. ''As you probably noticed,'' Kevin said after it was all over, ''we didn't give you a shock.'' And he made far too little effort, in my opinion, to suppress a chuckle when the data showing my skin conductance responses came up on the screen of his laptop. My own private Switzerland: the jagged lines traced five alpine leaps of fear that corresponded to the five times the yellow square had appeared during the experiment. ''Very robust indeed,'' he said. Liz Phelps's cool professional assessment of the initial data was even more disconcerting. ''Ooooh,'' she cried, ''look at that!'',Later, M.R.I. film in hand, I joined Phelps for lunch. ''So,'' she began, in a memorable conversational icebreaker, ''let's see your brain.'' While she examined the cross-sections, Phelps explained that the experiment -- done in collaboration with Mike Davis -- was designed to see if the amygdala played a role in anticipatory fear. ''You can be afraid of the dog in the neighborhood because the dog bit you,'' she said, ''and that's like fear conditioning, or you can be afraid of the dog in your neighborhood because you heard that the dog bit somebody else. Either way, you're going to have a fear reaction. But in one of them you have this direct experience, and in the other one you don't.'' In other words, learning, hearsay, rumor, word of mouth, subliminal suggestion, even the empathic horror we sometimes feel listening to details of a plane crash might create a hand-me-down sense of fear. ''So the question I wanted to ask,'' Phelps continued, ''is, 'Does the amygdala get activated when you just hear about a fearful situation?''',The answer appears to be yes. In the experiment I participated in, for example, no one received an actual shock, but I and other participants all associated a certain square with the likelihood of a shock and fired up our amygdalas -- in effect, underwent fear conditioning of the sort done in rats -- solely on the basis of what we'd been told. The experiment hinted at a more extended circuitry of fear in humans, because several other brain structures became active during the exercise, including the anterior cingulate and the insula. It's not exactly clear what their role is in this setting, Phelps told me later, although the cingulate seems to be involved in attention and the insula with cognitive understanding of fear.,The role of the imagination in anticipatory anxiety and fear introduces a powerful cognitive wild card to the prevailing disorders of our age, which is why the psychiatric community has been following these experiments with great interest. One of the emerging theories of anxiety disorders, advanced by Jack Gorman, who has been studying them for 20 years, is that each variation -- phobia, panic attack, post-traumatic stress disorder and so on -- represents a glitch somewhere in the fear circuitry, either because of an inherited biochemistry (nature) or remembered experiences (nurture), all this in turn modulated by the effects of stress, which alters body chemistry in a way that seems to accentuate irrational or unfounded fears, and by the effects of cognition, which can both hatch or defuse irrational fears.,The point, says Gorman, is that anxiety disorders seem to be a uniquely human phenomenon. They seem to involve the prefrontal cortex, he says, the part of the brain that differentiates us from the chimpanzees. ''It explains the overlap between the different anxiety disorders, because you can think about how you tweak different parts of the system and you're going to get a different disorder,'' he says. ''You know, bang on the amygdala and you're going to get panic attacks. Bang on the hippocampus and you're going to get post-traumatic stress disorder. You mess up the medial prefrontal cortex and you're going to get too much worrying. They're all within the same system.'',The implications of these theories for treatment are complicated. Existing medications like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S.S.R.I.'s), which include Prozac and Zoloft, are generally pretty effective for anxiety disorders, Gorman says, but recent studies have suggested more precise targets for a new generation of drugs that are already in the pipeline. Merck and Pfizer, for example, are working on new antidepressant and antianxiety medications that specifically block molecules that seem to arouse the fear circuitry, including corticotropin-releasing hormone, Substance P and glutamate. And there is an intriguing question buried in the saga of Ruth Lippin and so many other patients: Why does cognitive behavioral therapy seem to be as effective as drugs?,Around the time she passed the bar and began working as a lawyer representing tenants in their disputes against landlords, Lippin knew she needed to explore other treatment options. For about 10 years, she had been taking a powerful antianxiety drug called Ativan, which at first moderated her symptoms and then often made them worse. For almost as long, meanwhile, she had tried many forms of psychotherapy. It was almost by accident that she was referred, in 1987, to a cognitive behavioral therapist.,Developed in the 1960's by the psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck, this form of therapy gradually gets people with anxiety disorders to talk about, physically approach and ultimately experience the very things that terrify them. To render this particular form of therapy in the idiom of modern neurobiology, it deliberately sets up a program of repeated, programmed self-awareness exercises to rewire connections in the brain and form helpful new memories, just as repetitive practicing of the piano gradually creates a memory of motor skills. Thus, in the late 1980's, when Lippin rode the subway two hours a day, three days a week, as ''practice,'' or sat in traffic on the West Side Highway, learning to live with recurrent waves of adrenaline, she was in a subtle but significant way creating new synapses, new memories and thus new cognitive ways to override the fears she knew only too well. ''I could not believe I'd wasted 10 years of my life on inappropriate therapies,'' Lippin says, ''and I'm a pretty resourceful person. I could have been helped, but I didn't know.'',Her most severe personal tribulation came when she wanted to have children. When she began taking Ativan, she says, doctors told her its side effects were limited, but it can be difficult to discontinue its use. ''Like a good phobic,'' she says, ''I became very dependent on it psychologically as well as physically.'' She knew she would have to discontinue the drug during the course of a pregnancy, and she wasn't sure she could handle the stress. That was when she began to seek the help of a psychopharmacologist, Jack Gorman.,With a great amount of difficulty, Gorman weaned Lippin off Ativan, and at the end of 1991, she became pregnant with her daughter, Rachel. ''As the pregnancy proceeded,'' she recalls, ''I became more and more phobic, and Jack, being conservative, worried about putting me back on medications. I went from taking the subway to work without thinking to having to drive and park in a lot close to work. I'd be driving on West End Avenue in horrible traffic, with just surge after surge of adrenaline. And when it peaks, you say, 'Oh, now I've done it -- I've gone too far.' It felt like being punched in the stomach over and over and over again.'' After Rachel was born in September 1992, Lippin was put on Zoloft, an antidepressant medication, within days. It was the first time, she says now, that she had received an appropriate medication.,Two years later, despite the stress of her previous pregnancy, Lippin wanted to have another child. She stopped taking Zoloft and ''Bam, I was right back.'' The panic attacks returned, worse than ever. After the birth of her son, Jesse, in October 1995, she once again worked herself back toward normalcy through the combination of Zoloft and cognitive behavioral therapy. ''I felt incredibly discouraged and depressed that I was going to have to do this again,'' she recalled. ''I practiced for a year, and I realized that I had to integrate this piece of myself into my life and not hide it. So that was the beginning of the coming out. It was an illness, not a flaw, and nothing to be ashamed of.'',Coincidentally, while all this was going on, Gorman and three other colleagues -- Dr. David H. Barlow of Boston University, M. Katherine Shear of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Scott Woods of Yale University -- were conducting a large-scale clinical trial comparing the use of drugs to cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. The study, which has been presented at scientific meetings, will add fuel to the debate on whether drugs or therapy works best. Using a generation of antidepressant drugs prior to the current S.S.R.I.'s, the study showed that both drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective in treating panic disorder. But the researchers did tease out a potentially significant difference by following patients after they stopped treatment: drugs seemed to have worked quicker, but therapy provided more enduring success.,Gorman says he believes -- and the study Ruth Lippen participated in is designed to investigate -- that the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and drugs is effective because both influence the fear circuitry mapped out by LeDoux, Davis and others. The drugs probably do this by dampening the activity of the amygdala biochemically. Cognitive behavioral therapy does it, researchers believe, by strengthening memory circuits in the cognitive parts of brain through the repetitive exercises that are this therapy's hallmark -- the cognitive parts being those that know, for example, that there is nothing intrinsically dangerous about the George Washington Bridge. That kind of ''knowing'' -- a practiced memory of what is rational -- allows the reasoning brain to override the amygdala.,Like many people who have struggled with anxiety disorders, Ruth Lippin has often found herself wondering what her life might have been like if it hadn't been boxed in by irrational fears. ''I ask myself all the time,'' she says, ''what could I have done with my life if I hadn't devoted 75 percent of my energies to these anxieties?'' One thing she managed to do, beginning in 1997, was to take classes at White Plains Hospital Center, and now, more than 20 years after she stood terrified in the field in Holland, she has been certified to treat anxiety-disorder patients with ''supported-exposure therapy,'' a form of cognitive behavioral therapy in which the therapist accompanies a patient into the situation that he or she fears.,In her new profession, Ruth treats people who are afraid of being alone, afraid of driving in traffic, afraid of flying, afraid of being in elevators, afraid of wide open spaces, afraid of malls, theaters, museums. They are claustrophobic, hypochondriacal and phobic about social situations. The sheer range and catalogue of things that cause fear and anxiety, especially when patently irrational, made me wonder if humans, because of our prodigious imaginative capacities, are the most fearful creatures to walk the face of the earth.,When I mentioned the notion to Jerome Kagan, who has studied fearfulness in children at Harvard University, he practically laughed me out of his office. If you put monkeys on the Champs-elysee, he said, they would be consumed with fear and go crazy. But as everyone from Stephen King to R. L. Stine to the designers of those rides at Six Flags seems to know, imagination can tickle the amygdala and stir up an awful lot of anxiety, in ways we couldn't scientifically appreciate even a year ago.,''Certainly animals have more instinctual fear than humans do,'' Gorman told me. ''On the other hand, I don't think animals have the capacity to worry about so many things and to be concerned that so many things in the future could happen. And I think that does make us, probably in that sort of intellectual way, more fearful.'',As the spotlight of fear studies moves from rats and rabbits to humans, the most recent results from the animal lab may be telling us that fear has a very long shelf life in the cells where its memory is warehoused. In one of the most recent results from their laboratory, Joseph LeDoux, Greg Quirk and Chris Repa experimentally created anxiety in rats and then electronically eavesdropped on single brain cells in the animals' amygdalas. Once certain cells have been coupled by the perception of dangerous circumstances, they discovered, these cells continue to fire in unison, even after the animal has abandoned the behavior rooted in fear.,Fear, in other words, has soldered the circuitry of these rats into a permanent state, just waiting for the right circumstances to trigger the effect again. ''The party line,'' as LeDoux likes to say, ''is that fear is forever.''",STEPHEN S. HALL,"FEB. 28, 1999",Fear Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/fear-itself.html
"Anyone who read ''The Shining'' by Stephen King or saw Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of that novel might have approached Alexander McQueen's fall show with trepidation. After all, ''The Shining'' was about a haunted country hotel and its evil effect on a writer. Mr. McQueen's invitation contained more than 40 repetitions of the sentence ''All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,'' which the writer in the ''The Shining'' types endlessly when his mind goes. Would there be mayhem on the catwalk?,The scene that greeted guests arriving at the warehouse where the show was held on Tuesday night was also a tad disconcerting, with Plexiglas walls surrounding a set, separating the onlookers from a desolate snowscape with real ice on the ground and scraggly white birches. Awaiting the first models, guests were assailed with the sounds of a howling wind and the occasional baying wolf.,But Mr. McQueen's vision of the horror tale was far from literal. It was the setting more than the story that inspired him.,Models in spike-heeled sandals wore cozy clothes designed to fight the wintry chill. These included hooded shearling jackets and coats with cross-stitching; a rabbit fur poncho embroidered with pink flowers; heavy handknit sweaters with cowls or turtlenecks, and fantasy pieces like bodices made of silver coils and a skirt of stainless steel.,The ice was there for a performance by skaters dressed in white and bathed in blue light. Then snow fell, and wind machines blew for a finale of models in white padded jackets, layered skirts and a dress that looked like iced lace.,Mr. McQueen put on a spectacular, magical show. But he also showed clothes that were both beautiful and imaginatively conceived. The combination made the trip to London worthwhile for the hundreds of buyers and members of the press who attended, many of them in London mainly for Mr. McQueen. And it makes his possible move to show in New York next season a serious concern for the British fashion world, especially with Hussein Chalayan's reported intention to show in Paris in the future and the decamping this season of Antonio Berardi to Milan.,The absence of three stellar designers would leave gaping holes in the London fashion week schedule, which this season included 40 official catwalk shows -- most not worth getting on the Concorde to go and see.,Mr. Chalayan's, on Wednesday night, was the last on the schedule and almost as eagerly awaited as Mr. McQueen's. It started strikingly, with walls that had been lying on the floor hoisted up to enclose the runway on two sides, creating a foreshortened perspective, narrowing toward the back to increase the impression of distance.,Mr. Chalayan called his collection Echoform, and it echoed in many ways what he showed for spring. He continued the spare, vaguely futuristic appeal of straight-line shifts, jackets and coats, adding eccentric touches like a jumper with half its top cut away or sleeves hanging down the back of what looks from the front like a sleeveless sweater.,For any woman who likes to sleep standing up, he provided built-in padded neck rests, like the ones you can buy to inflate. Some dresses had A-line skirts with hems that curved up in back to show layers of fabric beneath, giving the effect of petticoats.,Mr. Chalayan seems to have given up making political statements in his presentations, concentrating on clothes that could be called commercial in the sense that a woman need not look like a fashion victim wearing some of them. But there is still enough experimentation to keep him in the vanguard of fashion.,Burberry, in its first runway presentation after a widely publicized overhaul of the company's image, managed to combine a sporty, modern approach with a nod to its own history. Roberto Menichetti, the designer, gave new life to the company's signature plaid by blowing it up larger and using the reverse side of the fabric for a blanket skirt, a cozy-looking dress and a neat coat.,He expanded on ideas from his spring collection by layering clothes in unexpected ways that never looked heavy, yet made perfect sense for keeping warm stylishly in winter. Layered wrap skirts were pressed together, rather than sewed. Colors were subtle and elegant, like those on faded frescoes. It was a successful debut and should help Burberry attract new fashion-conscious clients.,Matthew Williamson combined desert colors with sharp jolts of hot pink for embroidered brocade kimonos and long skirts, blanket shawls, dresses slit high on the thigh and sunburst designs, adding up to a collection to counterbalance the gloom of much winter fashion. And that is how the sexy young women who wear his clothes want to look.,Clements Ribeiro may be known in the United States mainly for collectible sweaters in wonderful patterns and colors, but his collection for fall went far afield into a romantic realm of British bohemians and Victorian widows. There were velvet-flocked chiffon dresses that combined two or more patterns; long openwork skirts; coachman and princess-line coats, with deep cuffs, and skirts with ribbons tied at the hem or left to hang loose. There are a lot of Victorian influences in London fashion this season, and if any place is entitled to find inspiration there, Britain certainly is it.,A tradition of knitwear is also part of the history of these isles, and two outstanding knitwear designers showed this week: Lainey Keogh and Julien Macdonald. Mr. Macdonald, who went over the top last season with fantasies designed solely for the runway, went back to his knitting needles -- or machines, as the case may be -- for a collection that managed to be creative and still offer clothes to sell. There were crunchy knits with cowl necklines, skinny dresses in black and white giraffe patterns, crocheted shawls with hints of glitter, and a red mohair coat with an oversize fur collar and cuffs as big as muffs.,Ms. Keogh held her show in the central hall of the Natural History Museum, which is dominated by a fossilized dinosaur and a grand marble staircase. As if to compete with the surroundings, she went overboard, sending out lots of metallic knits with flying fringe, cocoon coats of mohair and angora in bright colors, dresses dripping with feathers, and a daring purple cobweb knit worn over a nude body. If you stripped away some of the trappings, you would find lovely sweaters and knitted skirts underneath.,A few London designers who consider themselves avant-garde managed to alienate their audiences by dragging them to uncomfortable places and keeping them waiting too long for too little.,Owen Gaster held his show in a vacant store with crumbling walls painted with symbols of black magic and floors littered with what seemed blood-stained feathers left over from animal sacrifice. He compounded the felony by starting an hour and a quarter late and showing poorly made clothes with ill-conceived ideas, like a dress that was so thickly layered and bunched up in front that it appeared to be holding a heavy object. Even a wolf that a model brought out on a leash at the end looked unhappy to be there.,Sonja Nuttall showed clothes with too many ruffles in color combinations like orange and black in an abandoned railway tunnel so cold that she supplied foil sheets for the spectators to wrap themselves in. And everyone did, creating a striking effect when the lights sparkled on the silver. But that was off the runway.,Robert Cary-Williams set off firecrackers to start his show, then sent out passe-looking deconstructed clothes as smoke filled the air. And Tristan Webber, who has previously demonstrated a talent for cut, offended sensibilities at his show by notions like covering one model's face with a headdress that looked like an alien disease out of ''The X Files.'',But what would London be without its eccentrics?",ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO,"FEB. 28, 1999",FASHION REVIEW; The Wolves Are at the Door In London,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/style/fashion-review-the-wolves-are-at-the-door-in-london.html

"WHILE many large orchestras are suffocating under their own weight, a home-grown Connecticut ensemble has streamlined its image and is going big-time.,The American Classical Orchestra -- known for 18 years as the Fairfield Orchestra and Orchestra of the Old Fairfield Academy -- has announced a recapitulation of its primary theme: giving historically accurate performances on original instruments.,The orchestra will continue to be based in Fairfield County, and to offer its concert series in the Norwalk Concert Hall. (And in two years the ensemble hopes to be ensconced as well in a newly renovated 600-seat space at Carnegie Hall.),Audiences should not expect Mahler or Tchaikovsky, or even Debussy. The concerts in Norwalk and at Carnegie Hall will be rich with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Handel and Vivaldi; the programming might best be described as Baroque and Classical, with a toe in the Romantic era. The orchestra will range in size between 25 and 55 musicians. What reaches the ears is the aural equivalent of a fine aged brandy: warm, smooth and seamlessly blended.,The musicians are trained in historically precise techniques, and they render these on original or replicated instruments appropriate to the period of music they are playing. All the stringed instruments are made of wood and use natural gut strings, wood is the rule for the wind instruments, and the brass are valveless.,The sound of such an ensemble is ''more homogeneous, more tangy and piquant,'' said Thomas Crawford, the conductor of the orchestra and its founder in 1981.,Over its history, the orchestra -- which began life in a church basement in Fairfield -- has managed to stay out of financial difficulty and in coveted performing spaces like those at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.,But why the name change? Even Madonna, who is famous for reinventing herself, has kept her name. The American Classical Orchestra's name, however, describes itself precisely: it plays classical music, it is composed of American musicians, and it is an orchestra rather than a chamber ensemble.,It takes more than a name change, however, to propel an orchestra out of Fairfield County and onto the national stage. Changes have already been made backstage; the board has been reorganized, and office systems, ticketing and personnel are being re-evaluated.,Artistically, instead of running the gamut from early period performance to premiering contemporary compositions, the orchestra will concentrate exclusively on music from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Finally, the organization intends to expand geographically, which means going on tour.,Mr. Crawford was asked why the change was occurring.,''We're the next generation of the early music movement,'' he said. ''The level of scholarship and playing is much higher than in the early 1980's when there was a big early music movement.'' During that process, they restored thousands of stringed instruments, he said, adding that wind instruments are not restored, but copied.,Mr. Crawford continued: ''There's a reason to do it now, because there are no other groups doing it. In several years there will probably be several such groups. With that base of music coverage in our region, then it will be necessary to reinvent again.'',And, of course, a new century adds psychological distance and importance to things historic. In the 21st century, it might be asked, why should an orchestra be playing the great music of the 17th through 19th centuries in a 20th-century style on 20th-century instruments?,The American Classical Orchestra will perform on Saturday at 8 P.M. at the Norwalk Concert Hall.

"The United Nations Security Council today demanded an immediate halt to the fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea, after Ethiopian forces apparently smashed through the defenses along its disputed 600-mile border with Eritrea and appeared to be pushing deeper into the country in the direction of the Red Sea.,At an emergency meeting here, the Council called on both sides to refrain from further hostilities and resolve their border dispute on the basis of the peace plan drawn up the Organization for African Unity.,It also welcomed Eritrea's decision today to accept the plan, which calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Badme and a redefinition of the disputed border between the two countries by neutral experts.,In Los Angeles President Clinton also called on both sides to make peace on the basis of the African organization's plan and said the United States would continue to work with them ''to achieve a peaceful resolution of this conflict.'',Diplomats and senior United Nations officials said the Eritrean Army appeared to have suffered a serious reversal.,They expressed concern that Ethiopia -- which has been landlocked since it ceded its Red Sea ports of Massawa and Assab to Eritrea in 1993, when it granted it independence -- might be planning to seize one of them back.,Under this agreement Ethiopia was to have the use of those ports, but that has become impossible with the deterioration in relations between the two countries.,''The Ethiopians are an ancient and proud nation that is used to having access to the sea,'' a senior United Nations official said, pointing out that most of Ethiopia's trade must now pass through the small Red Sea nation of Djibouti.,Eritrea's immediate reaction to its military setback, officials here said, was to tell the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, today that it now accepted the peace plan, apparently because it no longer controls Badme.,In a letter to Mr. Annan calling for a Security Council meeting, Eritrea's United Nations representative, Haile Menkerios, also said  Ethiopian forces were now occupying ''sovereign Eritrean territory.''

With the Eritrean Army apparently in poor shape, the Ethiopians might now push deeper into the country, they said, or open another front, perhaps in the Zala Ambassa region, and try to outflank the remnants of Eritrean army.,A senior Administration official in Washington said the fighting had been heavy in the last four days, with substantial casualties and a total of about 200,000 soldiers deployed by the two sides.,A delegation of officials from the Organization of African Unity had been due to arrive today in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, to discuss the peace plan but never left the organization's headquarters in Addis Ababa, apparently because of the fighting.,After an eight-month lull, the border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea flared up again this month when Ethiopia opened an offensive in the Badme area.,Sporadic fighting has also been reported around Tsorona, south of Asmara, and Burre, southwest of Assab.,First reports of the fighting from the capitals of Addis Ababa and Asmara were confused, with both sides claiming to have inflicted huge casualties on the enemy.",PAUL LEWIS,"FEB. 28, 1999","End Fighting, U.N.

"Monica Lewinsky returns to the world this week, with the Interview, the Book, and then -- what? A regular spot with Barbara Walters on ''The View''? A consultant's post on CNN? Another shot at the public relations game? Ms. Lewinsky's list of references has expanded quite a bit since her last foray into the job market. Who would not want to hire the woman whom members of the House impeachment team have called ''intelligent,'' ''poised,'' ''mature,'' ''appealing,'' ''articulate'' and ''a very impressive young lady''? What employer would not look twice at a candidate who appears to remind virtually every Republican in Congress of members of his or her own family?,The first $1.2 million that Ms. Lewinsky netted for talking about her affair with President Clinton will not go far for a woman who has required the ministrations of so many expensive lawyers. But her potential as a profit center does not seem anywhere near tapped out. An army of Monica marketers is selling international rights to photo spreads. A fragrance line can not be far behind.,Until now, one of the more consistent laws of American social history was that having flings with prominent politicians does not pay. Remember Elizabeth Ray? Fanne Foxe the Argentine Firecracker? Donna Rice? Gennifer Flowers? Their post-scandal lives ran along very different trails, but in no case could you argue that romping with a political alpha dog turned out to be a good career move. A No Excuses jeans ad does not equate with long-term employment.,While Ms. Lewinsky's 20th-century predecessors tend to have depressing stories, the 19th-century ones are sometimes downright tragic. Kate Chase Sprague, the daughter of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, attempted to shield her lover, Senator Roscoe Conkling, when her husband exposed their affair in 1879. In gratitude, Mr. Conkling dropped her cold and continued on his career as the powerful Republican boss from New York. Ms. Sprague's marriage was ruined and she became a lonely exile. Meanwhile, the Senator berated his wife (stashed away in Utica) for ''discussing family matters of a private nature'' when she confided her own humiliation to a friend.,Madeline Pollard, the star of the most celebrated political sex trial of the 19th century, won a breach-of-promise suit against William Breckinridge, a Kentucky Congressman who used to give lectures on the importance of chastity at a school where Ms. Pollard was a student. Ms. Pollard followed the usual political mistress career pattern -- she made an unsuccessful try for a stage career. But her story is also an example of the ways the world has changed over the last hundred years. Testimony at the trial revealed that Ms. Pollard yearned to be a great writer, and had made a habit of sleeping with older men to pay her tuition. It is hard to imagine any of the Congressional firecrackers from the 1970's trading sex for education, and Ms. Lewinsky, by her own testimony, did not have literary ambitions on her mind when she ran into Mr. Clinton at the White House.,Warren Harding's mistress, Nan Britten, pioneered the idea of writing her own Presidential memoirs after Harding's relatives refused her requests for a stipend. She supported herself instead with royalties from ''A President's Daughter,'' an under-the-counter best seller about their love child that Ms. Britten claimed was intended to lend support to illegitimate children everywhere. That was Ms. Britten's last moment in the limelight, but the passage in which she described lovemaking in the Oval Office coat closet will live on forever.,Kay Summersby wrote a very profitable book denying that she had conducted a wartime romance with Dwight Eisenhower, then later wrote a second successful book saying she had. Ms. Summersby did not live long enough to report on which experience was more pleasant. But for most women in her situation, neither alternative has worked out very well. Mary Allen Peck always denied that she ever slept with Woodrow Wilson, but she died lonely and went down in history anyway as the woman who gave the President the nickname ''Peck's Bad Boy.'' Judith Campbell Exner kissed and told about John Kennedy, but she does not seem to have had a very good time since.,These stories serve an important function. There is nothing more powerful than the allure of power, and you cannot remind young people too often about the downside of illicit sex with a man who has to run for re-election. (We have not made enough progress in getting women into powerful jobs to tell whether the rule will work both ways.) ''I was planning a life with him. I didn't understand I was expendable,'' said Linda Jones after her affair with Henry Cisneros, then the Mayor of San Antonio, ended in an extraordinarily messy disaster. Neither party seems to have been wholly the victim in that romance, but the upshot was that Mr. Cisneros returned to his wife and Ms. Jones is a divorcee serving time in jail.,It is hard not to wish Ms. Lewinsky luck in breaking this chain. Anybody  who has seen her sexual indiscretions turned into a joke in Iraq and a  protest poster in Sudan deserves to be cut a little bit of slack. But the weight of history is against her, and those cautionary tales were so useful it is a shame to give them up.",GAIL COLLINS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Editorial Observer; Monica the Marketer Changes History's Script,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/opinion/editorial-observer-monica-the-marketer-changes-history-s-script.html
"HAVING declared an era of budget surpluses, the Democrats and the Republicans are busy parceling out money that is not yet in hand. They spend it differently, of course. But they are twins in their confidence that a surplus, having finally materialized in 1998, will continue to do so for a decade.,What goes unmentioned is Wall Street. Bluntly put, if stock prices fall sharply, the budget surplus disappears.,That is an accurate reading of the Government's own numbers, minus a nuance: the surpluses are also a product of income inequality. Thanks mainly to the stock market windfall, the richest Americans -- the 1 percent of households with incomes of $200,000 a year or more -- now pocket a much greater share of the nation's total taxable earnings than they did in 1994. After all, they own a lot of stock. They also pay the highest income tax rates. So Federal tax revenues have risen by enough to put the budget in surplus.,It is true that the surplus would not have come to pass without all the governmental cost-cutting that started in the Reagan Administration and has continued through the Clinton years. The payroll tax has also played a role, bringing in more than enough revenue to pay Social Security benefits for the time being. But the $70 billion budget surplus that appeared last year -- the first overall surplus since 1969 -- would have been a deficit instead without the spectacular rise in stock prices.,''A significant amount of new tax revenue over the last three years is attributable to the exuberance of the stock market,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.,THE mechanics are straightforward. While nearly 50 percent of the population owns stocks, either directly or indirectly through retirement accounts, wealthy Americans hold the lion's share. These are the people whose taxable incomes are $200,000 a year or more, after subtracting deductions. They have sold huge quantities of ever-more-valuable stock in recent years and have cashed in hundreds of billions of dollars in stock options that corporate America awards to its executives -- options that are taxed as ordinary income. Cash bonuses, commissions and fees have also swelled their incomes.,These wealthy households accounted for only 111,000 of the 120 million income tax returns filed in 1996, the latest year for which complete figures are available. That is only one-tenth of 1 percent of the total. But this tiny group accounted for 18.1 percent of all the household income reported in 1996, up from 14.6 percent in 1994. And while the number of 1997 returns is not yet published, the income breakdowns have been.,The highest-earning Americans' share jumped again, to 19.9 percent. Since they have the highest tax rate, 39.6 percent on personal income, their share of all household income taxes paid in 1997 rose to 37.2 percent from 29.9 percent in 1994. Thanks mainly to this group's rising incomes, Federal tax revenues were roughly $100 billion greater last year than they would have been if there had been no change in that 29.9 percent share. Put another way, the $70 billion budget surplus would have been a $30 billion deficit instead.,MOST of these data are available in a report issued in late January by the Congressional Budget Office, whose managers are appointed by the Republican majority in Congress. The Clinton Administration nevertheless embraces the budget office's calculations and also an implicit budget office assumption: the surpluses will survive for the next decade even if stock prices rise no further than they are now, but they will disappear if the market drops sharply.,That puts the budget surpluses on rather shaky ground. Stock prices are clearly overvalued, and perhaps in bubble territory, vulnerable to a collapse that would bring the budget surpluses down with them. Why is that so rarely mentioned?,There are reasons, of course. The Republicans, pushing for tax cuts, cite the budget surpluses as justification for collecting less from the citizenry. Uncertain surpluses undercut their case. And the Clinton Administration, busy claiming credit for the surpluses, sees no political advantage in reminding people that the money could disappear.,WHAT reluctance, however, is giving way a bit. Rather than cut taxes, Administration officials propose to save the surplus, in order to reduce the national debt and pay for Social Security in the future. A surplus in danger of disappearing in a falling stock market becomes one more reason to save the money while it is still there to save.,Even those who lament income inequality have been largely silent about its link to the budget surplus. The strong economy has finally lifted low-end wages, making wage inequality less of a problem, a development that pleases Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. But he had not anticipated the setback that has come with an upward spurt in income inequality -- that is, wages plus other kinds of income. ''We missed the stock options and capital gains,'' he said.,But income inequality, offspring now of the stock market, has acquired a certain respectability: the budget surpluses depend on it.,Or, as the Congressional Budget Office said in its January report, ''The more unevenly income is distributed, the higher the effective tax rate will be.''",LOUIS UCHITELLE,"FEB. 28, 1999",ECONOMIC VIEW; A Surplus Built on Bricks Of Income Inequality,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/economic-view-a-surplus-built-on-bricks-of-income-inequality.html

There is one incontrovertible fact about the mythic victor of the famous shoot-out at the O.K.

Earp's second wife, Josephine (Sadie) Marcus, was born into a German-Jewish family that had sailed around the Horn to San Francisco in 1860. As a young woman Sadie traveled around Arizona appearing in plays and musicals. She met Earp in Tombstone and they married in 1888. They eventually moved to the West Coast and ended up in Los Angeles, where Earp died in 1929.

"There was a crisis of fear in New York City in the early 1990's, and for good reason. Annual totals of 2,000 homicides, 6,000 shootings and 100,000 robberies are enough to frighten anyone. Residents had little confidence in the ability of the police to control and reduce violence, especially in minority neighborhoods.,But from 1994 on, the Police Department changed the reality and the perception. The department replaced what had been an uncoordinated, scattershot enforcement effort with focused strategic plans. In the 1990's, felony crimes have been cut in half, homicides reduced by nearly 70 percent, and order has been largely restored. The crisis of fear about crime is over.,But now we know that New York is facing a different crisis of fear. Though minority communities have benefited enormously from reduced crime, they now see themselves as under attack by the police. The tragic shooting of Amadou Diallo has become a rallying point for general resentment about aggressive police stops and searches.,People are worried that they themselves -- and particularly their teen-age sons -- are at risk, but from cops. They are not feeling the benefit of safer streets.,Although we can't know for certain until all the facts are in, the Diallo shooting appears to have been an error committed by fallible human beings. It is beyond imagining that these officers gunned down an innocent man intentionally. The New York Police Department shows more restraint in the use of force than do Federal enforcement agencies and most other big-city police departments.,But all that is irrelevant to the current crisis of fear. People are often afraid of crime out of proportion to its reality, so it should not be surprising that they fear police abuse out of proportion to its reality.,The challenge for the city government and the Police Department is not to prove frightened people wrong. It is to make visible and effective changes that ease their fears and restore their confidence in the police. The department can combine several strategies to find a way out of this crisis of fear.,The first strategy is openness. A police organization that willfully shuts itself off from scrutiny and public exposure can lose public trust. The role of police power in a democracy should be the expression of social consensus. But how can a consensus be reached if the Police Department, responding to orders from above, routinely withholds information from the state comptroller and the public advocate as well as from the press and public?,When I was New York City's Police Commissioner from 1994 to the spring of 1996, I tried to run an open department. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani closed down this effort. He forbade ''ride alongs,'' in which the public or press accompany patrolling police officers. He also dismantled the department's public information staff because its officials were too free with information, and he questioned the loyalty of anyone who didn't speak from a prepared script.,Things have gotten even worse. The concrete barriers around City Hall and Police Plaza that were erected last year send the wrong message. If you don't want your Police Department to appear as an occupying army, you shouldn't run the city from a fort.,The second strategy is outreach and recruitment in minority communities, so that the police will look more like the city they serve. It was one of my continuing frustrations as Police Commissioner that I could never get the money to start a youth career program that would have significantly increased the college-educated minority representation in the department.,I was drawn to policing at a very early age, and I believe that many minority youths could be, too, if the effort were made to interest them during their high school and post-high school years. The program would have begun with our existing summer youth academy for 12-to-14-year-olds and continued on through a proposed public safety high school and all the way to the City College system.,This would have fostered friendlier relationships between young people and the police. It would also have provided focus, direction and mentoring to teen-agers, while simultaneously giving the Police Department a stronger field of potential candidates to choose from. Unfortunately, the idea was not allowed to go forward. Even an expansion of existing cadet programs, which were 70 percent minority, was stopped, despite the recommendations of the department and of experts at John Jay College.,The third strategy is imaginative police training. I believe that expanding the department at this time would be a mistake. Instead, resources should be used more wisely to raise the pay of the officers we have, to attract the best qualified new candidates and to create a ''learning organization'' that continuously and tirelessly trains them throughout their careers for the challenges and complexities they face on the streets.,The Police Academy must be given the resources to establish itself as a center of leading-edge ideas and reality-based training. It should put into practice many of the recommendations made by the panel on police-community relations appointed by the Mayor in 1997.,There is no more difficult challenge in a free society than the legitimate exercise of force. There are thousands of police officers in the department who meet that challenge every day with extraordinary discretion, judgment and intelligence. It's up to the department and the city to support them with open lines of communication to the public, a genuine commitment to minority recruitment and the best and most sophisticated training.,New York City should not waste this opportunity -- and, yes, the current crisis should be viewed as an opportunity -- to face up to and resolve the issue of relations between the police and minority residents.,With crime down so dramatically, we have a chance to forge a lasting alliance in the communities that need the police the most. Not only would such an alliance heal racial divisions in our city, it would also give New Yorkers more of what they want: continued success in reducing crime and a police force that is better woven into the fabric of city life.",WILLIAM J.

Forced to buy individual insurance, we were expected to subsidize high-risk people rejected for coverage through their small employers, who continue to enjoy such favoritism.,The state urged us to practice what I call ''nomad economics,'' repeatedly moving from one insurer to another to avoid huge premium increases.

"STEAK may still be out of favor with some folks, but you'd never know it from the number of steakhouses that have opened in recent years. In a short time, Porterhouse in South Norwalk, has created such a buzz that it always seems to be packed, especially on weekends.,Part of the appeal of this friendly, casual place is that the menu is considerably wider and deeper than just variations on a steak theme. In fact, some of the best dishes of the chef, Andrew Howgego, were more demanding than beef.,A terrific starter, for instance, was a salad of tender marinated venison, oyster mushrooms, lardons (made of flavorful Belgian bacon), toasted pine nuts and field greens, lightly tossed in a house vinaigrette.,Sausages of confit of lamb and garlic made a pungently robust contrast to a super-delicate sweet pea flan. Quietly satisfying was a dish of three fat fingers of melted Parmesan, Monterey Jack and aged Cheddar, each enveloped in a crunchy overcoat of Japanese breadcrumbs, served with crisp deep-fried curly parsley and lemon wedges.,Crispy fried oysters were big and juicy enough to overcome their thick breading, and the roasted pepper and sweet vermouth sauce was delicious. Also pleasing was the plate of three house-made pates and terrines served with a crisp Parmesan tuile. We weren't as lucky with the smoked tuna and trout cakes, which in theory made a welcome relief from the ubiquitous crab cakes, but the mushy texture overpowered the smoky flavor and tuna-trout marriage.,As for entrees, there was no contest. The marinated venison, pan-roasted in a luscious berry and peppercorn sauce and served with a compatible chestnut puree, was fork-tender and full of flavor, easily the best meat we sank our teeth into at Porterhouse.,A close second was the grilled pork loin. Marinated in cilantro, soy sauce, ginger and honey, it consisted of fork-tender slices, embraced by a sweet-tangy burnt-honey barbecue sauce, served with sauteed spinach and crusty-topped twice-baked sweet potatoes.,Roasted pheasant was more than just an also-ran. Abutted by a roasted garlic broth, maitake mushrooms and broccoli rape, it made a first-rate main course.,Beef dishes earned a mixed report card. Our char-grilled filet mignon was perfection -- tender, full of flavor, everything we hoped for and expected. Porterhouse steak, on the other hand, was tough and gristly, and the seasoned prime rib was dry and characterless (as were the three tiny popovers that came with it).,All beef dishes come with a choice of bearnaise, peppercorn or wild mushroom sauce. Mid-week, when we ordered the filet mignon, our waiter offered a sampling of all three sauces. On a busy Saturday night, sauce was forgotten altogether.,Night of the week was also a factor in the breads served. Saturday, the breads were commercial rolls. Mid-week, warm red and black pepper bread with an excellent crust came fresh from the oven.,A prize dessert was the caramelized spiced apple and bourbon tart, with a superb crust and a hint of pepper to puncture the sweetness.  Espresso semi-freddo in a berry sauce and flourless chocolate hazelnut cake were also worthwhile choices.,A three-course dinner for two came to $69, before tax, tip and drinks. Porterhouse has a small, respectable selection of wines, mostly from the West Coast, priced from $22. We were more impressed by the beer list, with 20 microbrewery choices by bottle, another five on draft.,It is always cheerful news to find a Washington Street restaurant doing well.

"WHEN Pinocchio is at its best, rather than bringing Italian dining to American diners, this restaurant can transport the diners to Italy, turning Eastchester into Trastevere. But since its auspicious opening more than 12 years ago, its moments of greatness have gradually become fewer. These days, diners are faced with a menu considerably shortened and a kitchen that can be careless and, worse, uninspired.,A long list of specials was recited without prices, which turned out to be higher than those on the table menu would lead one to believe. Until management learns to use a copier, or even a blackboard, we suggest diners ask the price of every special.,That being said, what to order? Some items had the old time zip. Paper-thin slices of fennel made a splendid addition to a salad of peppery arugula -- all lightly dressed and topped with wide shavings of Parmesan. Artichoke stuffed with a generous helping of herbed goat cheese shared the plate with meaty shiitake caps and roasted peppers topped with anchovy. Carving through this appetizer took some time, but it was worth it.,Think about sharing a lavish seafood salad. This special was composed of thick-cut smoked salmon, marinated shrimps and scallops, chunks of lobster and caponata -- each component cradled prettily in its own cup of lettuce. But a heap of sliced portobellos and chicken livers, a potentially pleasing match, arrived unappealingly murky and astringent from an over reduction of balsamic vinegar -- an amateurish preparation.,Having already ordered appetizers, we hardly needed a pre-appetizer and found pushy the suggestion that, while waiting for them, the table share a plate of fried calamari. The squid proved weighty under a leaden coat of batter and appeared on our bill at $11.,As an appetizer or an entree, fresh gnocchi here is a special worth listening for. These soft, divinely slippery little nuggets came with a subtle sauce fortified with bits of filet mignon, sage and a shot of cream. Green pappardelle, another special, was also splendid, the dish's smoky sweetness resulting from the addition of prosciutto, peas and velvety mascarpone sauce. In this company, farfalle rustica (eggplant and mozzarella) was indeed the country bumpkin with nothing much to say for itself.,A couple of specials represent the paucity of fish offerings, and the kitchen over cooked both salmon and monkfish. Plump, nicely seasoned risotto arrived studded with bay scallops and small rock shrimps, flecks of tomato adding a bit of color. Much better choices, and value, could be found among the chicken offerings.,Pounded to elegant thinness, chicken breasts martini received a dip in Parmesan before being sauteed quickly with white wine and lemon. And although chicken Marengo was hardly the chicken with crayfish, fried egg and Cognac that Napoleon's victory at Marengo supposedly inspired, Pinocchio's variation -- with pignoli, tomato, raisins, olives and prosciutto -- was nonetheless delicious. Decent chicken with balsamico suffered from the dark over-reduction of vinegar and would have profited by a bed of rice to dilute the intensity of the sauce.,Pounded, butterflied veal chop came with fiery cherry peppers, which overwhelmed the meat and the mouth.,A plate of nicely cooked broccoli and roasted potatoes came to every table, making an a la carte vegetable unnecessary.,Desserts are sweet and guileless: hazelnut gelato, smooth tiramisu, dense chocolate ganache muffin and a catch-all bombe: a layering of custard, ice cream, rum cake, berries and you name it. Good coffee comes in big cappuccino cups.,A three-course dinner averages $35 without drinks, tax and tip. Depending on the cost of special appetizers and entrees, that average can increase considerably.

Trattoria signals Italian and casual, while meritage sounds a with-it, sophisticated note.

Windows are festooned with burgundy draperies, strings of beads, colored crystals and seasonal decorations.

Meritage offers a half-dozen designer pizzas in addition to more traditional pies. Throughout the evening, diners can watch chefs tossing dough into the air and check the progress of locals popping in for takeout. We sampled pizzas as shared appetizers and were especially fond of a three-cheese beauty studded with roasted garlic.,Service is as much a mixture as everything else here. The host is warm, welcoming and on his toes. He immediately delivers a basket of warm, homemade focaccia and pizza knots along with a bottle of deliciously flavored olive oil. The rest of the service is hit and miss. The sweet waitresses don't care enough to note who ordered which dishes and usually just announce their arrival and wait for guests to speak up.,The bus boys and girls have, no doubt, been told to keep water glasses full and they are diligent. But white wine and water are served in the same glasses and we had to stay vigilant to keep our wine glasses from being topped off with water.  That, along with the restaurant's high noise level, made for a less-than-relaxing evening.,Diners cannot sit back and rely on the chef, either. While most of the food is innovative and exciting, there are a few booby traps. Salads are especially appealing but even here there are flaws. Julienned strips of endive tossed with spiced walnuts and caramelized apples, and a plate of greens crowned with a crisp medallion of oozing goat cheese, pears and candied pecans were both memorable. Still, the pears in the latter were unripe and hard and the endive-Gorgonzola amalgam, requested without nuts because of a diner's food allerg), arrived with one lone walnut -- enough to kill -- hidden in the mix. The spinach and wild mushroom salad with a smoked bacon vinaigrette sounded like a winner, but the greens were drowned in the dressing and rendered inedible. The house salad in a Champagne-shallot vinaigrette was, on the other hand, underdressed.,But the traditional Caesar was fine as was the soup du jour, a creamy puree of potato, roasted garlic and onion. Other crowd-pleasers were a platter of grilled eggplant slices topped with truly ripe tomatoes and house-made mozzarella, and an evening special of twin shrimp-crab cakes accompanied by a chunky tomato jam and a clump of mesclun.,Beef took top honors at entree time. The menu's strip steak glazed with melted Gorgonzola and escorted by matchstick french fries, and an evening special of filet mignon au poivre with a wild mushroom-red wine sauce were both tender, juicy and cooked precisely to order. Another prime pick was the moist roast chicken stuffed with a tasty assembly of prosciutto, spinach, fontina cheese and porcini mushrooms, set over a bed of white beans.,But osso buco was not fall-away-tender, and pancetta-wrapped trout over a ragout of tomatoes, capers and olives was difficult to eat. Horseradish-crusted salmon with a mustard-butter sauce was an unqualified success. Sauteed jumbo shrimp over spaghetti in a pesto sauce needed a dash of salt to put it into the winners' circle.,Dessert is the most consistent course. Only a slightly dry brownie sundae failed to get raves. But the gelato crowning that sundae was homemade and delicious. There are wonderful flavors like pumpkin, chocolate-hazelnut, pistachio and vanilla. The sorbets (lemon and raspberry) were tangy and refreshing though not homemade. All other desserts are, and they will destroy any diet resolutions. The flourless chocolate torte, as rich as fudge, is a must order as is the creamy tiramisu, served in an over-sized coffee cup. A satiny creme brulee also won applause. Still, the star of the roster is the warm apple-cranberry crisp topped with vanilla gelato.,Meritage Trattoria,14 Station Road, Bellport, 286-3300.,Good,Atmosphere -- Casual yet classy cafe.,Service -- A mix of concern and confusion.,Sound level -- The hard surfaces make conversation difficult when the restaurant is full.,Recommended dishes -- Pizzas, endive-Gorgonzola salad, potato-garlic-onion soup, Caesar salad, grilled eggplant-tomato-mozzarella plate, shrimp-crab cakes, strip steak, filet mignon, salmon, roast chicken, all desserts.,Wine list -- It is short, with about 35 choices.

"The death of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African killed in a fusillade from four white police officers, was both a personal tragedy and a civic trauma. The strains it caused between the New York Police Department and the minority and immigrant communities are serious and prolonged. Many white citizens share the concern that the city's declining crime rate has been achieved through brutal tactics that are aimed disproportionately at people of color and threaten the civil liberties of all citizens. This concern points toward Mr. Diallo's legacy to his adopted city. That legacy is an overdue discussion about how to fulfill the demand for safer streets without rending the social fabric of a diverse and sometimes unruly city.,No one in the police department or at City Hall can afford to misunderstand the fear aroused by the 41 bullets sprayed in Mr. Diallo's direction by a police unit that prides itself on owning the night. Coming at a time when racial profiling is in the news and memories of the police assault on Abner Louima are still fresh, the seemingly disproportionate force in this case convinces residents of minority neighborhoods that aggressive crimefighters can be dangerous to them and their children.,Those who express this concern most thoughtfully, like Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League, are careful to praise police for retaking New York's most lawless territories and liberating ordinary residents to move beyond their fortified apartments. But these same voices warn that too many people now fear police as much as they once feared crime. There are encouraging signs that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir are listening. The Mayor told new police graduates recently they must be respectful and restrained, that they must act as civil rights workers. The Commissioner has noted that more training is planned and that renewed efforts are being made to add minority officers to the force. He is also instituting other reforms, and has retrieved from the City Hall basement the task force report after the Louima case that Mr. Giuliani derided at the time as proposals that ''make very little sense.'',We hope the retrieval of the Louima report indicates a new openness to information, for there seems to be a rich mix of statistics and opinion that can help the Giuliani administration adjust police practices in a way that preserves rather than jeopardizes gains in the war on crime. Admittedly some of the information is contradictory. The Mayor noted that the number of shootings by police is down to 1985 levels. At the same time, the police unit in the Diallo case has frisked more than three people for every one arrested, a situation that feeds concerns that young men are being frisked on the basis of race. William Bratton, the former Police Commissioner whose recommendations appear on today's Op-Ed page, has argued that when crime drops to a certain level, police must adjust how they wield their authority,The same can be said for the city's chief crimefighter. There is a time for the announcement of new crackdowns and a time for following through on the spirit of dialogue embodied in the Mayor's address to the police cadets. It is that latter spirit that should guide Mr. Giuliani and Commissioner Safir to a new effort to reassure New Yorkers that the police are there to protect and serve, not to threaten in arbitrary or discriminatory ways.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",The Diallo Legacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/opinion/the-diallo-legacy.html

"THE DIARY OF VASLAV NIJINSKY,Unexpurgated Edition.,Edited by Joan Acocella.,Translated by Kyril FitzLyon.,Illustrated. 312 pp. New York:,Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30.,SINCE its publication in 1936, the diary of Vaslav Nijinsky has been treated as the visionary testament of a tormented genius. The diary -- written in a six-week burst on the eve of its author's confinement to an asylum and shot through with the Tolstoyan utopianism to which he had recently been converted -- has attracted a predictable raft of cliches: the artist as madman, the madman as seer, the seer as suffering Christ. Auden quoted it in ''September 1, 1939''; one critic proclaimed, inevitably, that it was not Nijinsky who was mad, but us.,And yet the work so received, it turns out, had been heavily tampered with -- pruned, rearranged, partly rewritten -- to produce exactly that response. Nijinsky had long been unreachably psychotic when his wife, Romola, discovered the manuscript in an old trunk, then sanitized and published it to feed the legend of which she had become both guardian and beneficiary. The result bears about the same relationship to the original record of Nijinsky's struggle with madness as does the 19th-century deathbed scene to a real death. The tears are there, but what's missing is the ugliness, the reek: paranoia, grandiosity, sexual and excretory obsessions.,It is only now, some 80 years after its composition, 20 after Romola's death and 6 after the release of copyright by the couple's daughters, that we finally have a complete and faithful translation of what Nijinsky actually wrote. Kyril FitzLyon's rendition from the Russian is stubbornly colloquial, while Joan Acocella provides a lucid preface and comprehensive annotation. The new version is harder to read than Romola's hackneyed sentimentalism, but in displaying its author in all his terrifying particularity, it allows us to glimpse in his madness not the apotheosis, but at least the ruins, of his genius.,Nijinsky had always been singularly uncommunicative, almost mute in social situations, and his writing had been limited to correspondence. Why the sudden torrent of words? First, as a form of self-defense. By the time the diary opens, his bizarre, sometimes violent behavior has thrown Nijinsky's Swiss household into turmoil. Romola has been urging him to see a specialist in Zurich -- a trip from which he believes, correctly, that he will never return. She has also been consulting a local doctor, Hans Frenkel, who soon begins trying out his smattering of medical-school psychiatry on the famous new patient, coming almost daily to probe his thoughts, administer word-association tests and the like. Faced with increasing pressure to reveal and account for his mental life, Nijinsky discovers the written word as a more secure and spacious inner realm. Here he can spend hours observing, explaining, accusing: ''I pretend to be mad for my own purposes.'' ''My wife will weep if I die, but I know that she will soon forget me.'',Before long the diary itself becomes the focus of struggle. Romola knows it's about her; Frenkel wants to examine it; Nijinsky retreats to it whenever things downstairs get too tense. One of the most striking things about the diary is how well, despite his disordered mind, Nijinsky captures the sense of a house going to pieces around him. His descriptive prose has the insistent force of simple details scrupulously recorded. His sensitivity to ambient sounds and what they might portend, as Acocella notes, allows us to feel the texture of the passing moment: his wife sobbing in another room, the telephone ringing (is it Frenkel?), conversations, footsteps.,Nijinsky also has a gimlet eye for character, as well as a poison pen for those he condemns. Of Romola's mother, at whose house in Budapest the Nijinskys had spent a tempestuous 18 months during the war, he writes: ''She kisses me so that I will think she loves me. I know she has no soul. I know that pieces of glass burst in her heart when she says she loves me.'',We can also see the dancer in the writer, the man whose physical genius drove the likes of Marcel Proust, Jean Cocteau and Paul Claudel to ecstatic utterance. Nijinsky's prose is persistently rhythmic, a spiraling, percussive dance; he seems as interested in how words sound as in what they mean. The diary even breaks at times into verse -- long, babbling chains of association that veer from the punning to the surreal. Nijinsky's imagination, too, is grounded in the physical, generating figures of speech that provide some of the diary's most brilliant moments. Of the English, whom he saw as greedy and cold, he writes: ''John Bull eats a lot of money. . . . The English do not like dancing, because they have a lot of money in their stomachs.'',Finally, there is the diary's central philosophical thrust, which exalts living ''feeling'' over dead ''thinking.'' While this may be standard Tolstoyism, it is also the creed of a man who experienced the body as the sole source of truth. Indeed, Nijinsky's exquisite sensitivity to his own sensations underlies the diary's chief claim to value, its immediacy as a record of the man's anguish and his attempts to cope with it. If he often resents his wife in these pages, he more often pities her for the pain he is causing. When Frenkel tells him to stay away from her, he does not protest.,INSTEAD, he turns to the diary, and to God. ''I am God,'' he keeps insisting, but the grandiosity seems like so much whistling in the dark; he's not at all sure what his relation to God is. In a set of bravura passages, he recounts a series of mountain walks that read like episodes from the Old Testament. There is the man, balanced between ascent and abyss, and there is the voice of God, admonishing, testing: ''God said to me. 'Go home and tell your wife that you are mad.' '' A force is taking over his mind, making him do evil things. But, he protests, he is not evil, not a beast, only human. At times he literally stains the notebook with tears, becoming now not a Cain but a Lear: ''I have nothing and I want nothing. . . . I am weeping . . . I do not want to upset my servants. If they are upset, I will die of hunger. I love Louise and Maria. Maria gives me food, and Louise serves it.'',At last, his mother-in-law arrives to take him to Zurich. The diary's final lines are not, as the old edition had it, ''God seeks me and therefore we will find each other,'' but a mundane thought that never gets finished. How ironic that in erasing the real ugliness of his insanity, the old version silenced not only Nijinsky's true voice but the magnificently gifted body from which it came. And how fortunate we are to have them both restored.",WILLIAM DERESIEWICZ,"FEB. 28, 1999",Dancing With Madness,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/dancing-with-madness.html
"DAVID PARSONS vividly remembers the adrenaline surge during the first few minutes in the studio in 1981 when Paul Taylor began choreographing his tour de force, ''Arden Court.''  ''Paul started with the men in the studio at 1 P.M.,'' Mr. Parsons says. ''It was emotional and physical at the same time. And the fact that it was all the men that day, you had the testosterone thing happening.'',Mr. Taylor tossed some tough choreography at the dancers that day. According to Mr. Parsons, he asked them to ''go horizontally while you're turning in a spread eagle, flip over like a cat and land on your paws.'' Mr. Parsons, who now heads his own company, says: ''Paul was working in the vein of the impossible, and then he brought it back to the possible. The things that came out of that made 'Arden Court' special.'',During those initial groundbreaking minutes in the studio, choreographers and dancers provide the alchemist's ingredients to be blended in the creative crucible. Though they all work in different ways, choreographers from Bournonville and Petipa to Balanchine, Graham and Twyla Tharp, have always hoped that music, steps, apprehension, fear, energy and invention will meld into something special, maybe even a masterpiece.,Mr. Taylor, who has created many masterworks since he founded his company in 1954, is certainly no stranger to this hope. During the last year he has made two works that will have their New York premieres during his company's two-week season, which starts at City Center on Tuesday. ''Oh, You Kid!'', danced to ragtime scores, is a comment on turn-of-the-century America. The first rehearsal of ''Oh, You Kid!'', says Thomas Patrick, a 10-year veteran of the company who portrays a neurotically reluctant bridegroom in the silent-movie sequence of the piece, was devoted to learning basics. ''We started working on the two-step, the quickstep and the fox trot,'' he recalls. ''We were getting a glossary of vocabulary.'',The second premiere, ''Fiddlers Green,'' a post-modern hoedown in overalls, is set to minimalist fiddle music titled ''John's Book of Alleged Dances,'' by John Adams. Mr. Taylor began trying out movement without music on Patrick Corbin, one of the piece's soloists, before working with the rest of the company. ''He wanted to work on simple jumps and bouncing, making it as easy as possible, a sort of nothingness to the movement,'' Mr. Corbin says.,With a laugh, he adds, ''It's really quite difficult when you're trying to get off the ground.'',Mr. Taylor's preparations for starting a new work are usually concentrated on counting out the music before the first rehearsal. ''Paul was always prepared with his musical map,'' says Karla Wolfangle, who danced with the Taylor company from 1981 to 1993. ''He would have an idea of where the movement vocabulary was coming from. We were like his paint or colors in his creation.'',When asked about the start of the rehearsal process, Mr. Taylor says: ''Generally I don't do a whole lot of explaining. I do the minimum so the dancers know where they're going or what the ideas of the piece are. There's a lot of mind reading going on, a shorthand, so you don't waste any time.'',Mr. Taylor's methods of plunging into a new work, however, have varied over the years. With his signature 1975 work ''Esplanade,'' he did a good deal of planning on paper to figure out the dancers' intricate patterns, and he knew in advance that he wanted to use natural movement -- running, walking, falling down and sliding. In contrast, before choreographing ''Byzantium'' in 1984, Mr. Taylor claims the steps came to him in a dream. ''When I woke up, I remembered the steps exactly,'' he says. ''Two groups of dancers were doing counterpoint things. I was able to just come into the studio and teach it. I wish that happened more often.'' And ''Aureole,'' from 1962, began not in the studio but on the tiny stage of the Theatre des Arts in Paris, affording Mr. Taylor the chance to view the work from the audience.,During the six years that Mr. Taylor danced with Martha Graham's company, he recalls her relating long tales, heavy in the mythology and primitive mystery departments, before ever giving physical life to a new work. ''She used to talk us to death,'' says Mr. Taylor, waving his cigarette heavenward in her direction. ''We were waiting and waiting to move. We had to listen to these stories that had nothing to do with what we were working on.'',Unlike Graham, many choreographers tend to be primarily physical rather than verbal when introducing a new piece. For Twyla Tharp, who danced with the Taylor company in the 1960's, the initial communication to the dancers is usually by osmosis rather than explanation. ''Twyla is such a dancer,'' says Sara Rudner, one of Ms. Tharp's favorite muses, who performed with her until 1984. ''So much of my memory of the early work is of Twyla doing, not saying.'',Rose Marie Wright, an original Tharp company member, agrees that Ms. Tharp  prefers to show rather than tell. ''Twyla will sometimes have a phrase in mind, and then just start manipulating it,'' she says.,Allegra Kent says that each new collaboration with George Balanchine was ''like a baby, a baby born ready to fly.'' Merrill Ashley, for whom Balanchine created some of his last ballets, recalls that starting a new work with him ''was always a very quiet process; not much happened.'' According to Melissa Hayden, a prominent ballerina with New York City Ballet for more than 20 years, ''Balanchine usually would walk into the room and say, 'Now we will do this.' He would indicate with his fingers what he wanted you to do, and you did it.'',In 1957, when he arrived at the School of American Ballet studio to choreograph the solo female variation from ''Agon'' to the Stravinsky score, the rehearsal pianist had not shown up. Balanchine promptly sat down at the piano and played the quirky music for Ms. Hayden. ''So then he gets up and shows me some steps,'' Ms. Hayden says. ''I thought 'this is fun.' '' One hour later the one-minute variation was finished.,But creating a new piece is not always seamless. When Ms. Tharp took her post-modern ways to the Joffrey Ballet studios in 1973 to choreograph ''Deuce Coupe'' to pop hits by the Beach Boys, the Joffrey dancers greeted her with disbelief the first day. Ms. Rudner describes demonstrating some of Ms. Tharp's sliding and hopping steps with rhythmic variations: ''We looked over our shoulders, and that was it. Almost no one was doing anything. It was so foreign a working method to the Joffrey dancers. Some of them even sat down.'' Finally Ms. Wright acted as interpreter, so that when Ms. Tharp demonstrated a traveling squiggle-glide with a twitch, landing in fifth position, Ms. Wright would translate the movement into ballet vocabulary, saying, ''that's a glissade.'' ''Deuce Coupe'' went on to become the smash hit of the season.,Dancers can never predict what may happen during those initial moments in rehearsal for a new ballet. No one was expecting Balanchine to create neo-classical ballet's most erotic duet when he began working with Ms. Kent on ''Bugaku.'' ''Just lift your leg here, dear,'' Ms. Kent remembers Balanchine's saying, as he pointed to Edward Villella's left shoulder. As the two dancers found themselves entangled in one of ''The Kama Sutra's'' more acrobatic positions, the understudies watched from the back of the room in bug-eyed shock. It was 1962. ''I couldn't believe some of the things I was asked to do,'' Ms. Kent says with a giggle. ''Eddie may have raised his eyebrows a little, but he was so gallant.'',WHAT happens on that first day of creation may be very different from the final product. Rehearsals for Ms. Tharp's ''Fugue,'' began on a quiet, grassy hill in New Berlin, N.Y., with three women in sneakers. And yet at its premiere in 1970, ''The Fugue'' became a stark feminist statement with the women stomping on a miked stage in boots. Paradoxically, the women warriors' boots came from Bloomingdale's, in a fashionable rust-colored suede.,''Company B,'' one of Mr. Taylor's most popular successes, also underwent a distinct metamorphosis. He had made a decision not to use idiomatic movement of the period when he started choreographing the ''Bugle Boy'' solo on the first day of rehearsal. ''He wanted only lyrical Taylor movement to the Andrews Sisters music, curvy arms, and no references to social dancing,'' says Mr. Corbin, who danced in the original cast. ''He wanted no war references, no references to battle. They worked themselves in naturally. If he had tried to apply them at the beginning, it would have been surface. He had one idea and changed it as we worked.'',There are the rare occasions when fresh choreography gets thrown out completely. Mr. Taylor once began choreographing a piece to the music of ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' using a suggestive cigar. ''It was going to be called 'The Sorcerer's Cigar,' or something,'' says Ms. Wolfangle, who was to perform the piece. ''Paul was having the greatest time, he was loving it, but it was too crazy to be believed.'',Drawing a blank in the first rehearsal of a new work is the stuff of every choreographer's nightmares. Ms. Hayden even recalls one instance with Balanchine, while starting a little-known ballet called ''Bayou'' in 1952. ''He had to do a ballet he didn't like, a piece of Americana,'' she says. ''It was one of those things probably Lincoln Kirstein dreamed up we had to do.'' The dancers sat in the studio for two hours as Balanchine tried to figure out what to choreograph. ''That never happened again,'' she adds.,Mr. Parsons, who has experienced the wrath of choreographers block, says: ''If you know you're not together, that first day, can be so painful. Everyone is looking at you, and you're going down the tubes.'' But when things are on track, ''In those first 10 minutes every nerve is tingling, you have a heightened awareness, your senses are sharpened,'' Mr. Parsons says. ''And there's always the feeling you might be making history -- something that will be around for hundreds of years.''",JOSEPH CARMAN,"FEB. 28, 1999",DANCE; Baby Steps Meet Invention As a Dance Grows,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/dance-baby-steps-meet-invention-as-a-dance-grows.html

"''Awwwfff with her head!'' commands Miranda Richardson, the blithely imperious Queen of Hearts. The ''her'' is, of course, Alice, and as played by Tina Majorino, she does not so much as quiver at the threat. This is a very self-possessed Alice in the new ''Alice in Wonderland,'' a Hallmark Entertainment production to be seen tonight on NBC.,Ms. Richardson and Simon Russell Beale, who plays the King of Hearts, spoof a long lineage of English rulers, some of whom they have played on stage and screen. But Ms. Majorino, a young Californian, is able to hold her own with these English peers of the theatrical realm. Whether falling down the rabbit hole, swimming in the pool of tears, growing monstrously large or infinitesimally small, she never loses her composure.,Ms. Majorino comes to Alice after smaller roles in ''Andre'' and ''Waterworld'' as well as a few independent films. Her one previous brush with ''Alice'' was in the fourth grade. She was the director. As a teen-ager, Ms. Richardson was also in a schoolgirl ''Alice,'' playing the Walrus, a role more appropriately claimed in tonight's film by Peter Ustinov.,In common with ''Peter Pan'' and ''Cinderella,'' ''Alice in Wonderland'' has had a diverse panoply of adaptations, theatrical and cinematic, musical as well as dramatic. The films include the 1933 Hollywood movie (with Gary Cooper, Cary Grant and W. C. Fields), the Ivan Bunin puppet version, the 1951 Walt Disney cartoon feature and various British films, in one of which Peter Sellers played the March Hare.,On the stage, productions have ranged from Eva Le Gallienne's stately Broadway dramatization (last revived in 1982) to Andre Gregory's experimental Off Broadway variation, which featured the maddest of Mad Tea Parties. In 1995 Robert Wilson and Tom Waits collaborated on a musical called ''Alice.'' Several seasons ago Martha Clarke and Christopher Hampton offered a mysterious approach at the Royal National Theater.,With the new television film, Nick Willing, the director, was able to use cutting-edge techniques in computer animation to create, in his words, ''an epic world that is more wonderful a Wonderland than anyone has ever done.''' His film is an attempt to put almost the entire story on the screen with only minor interpolations, like framing it with a country house party.,Drawing from both ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking Glass,'' the television movie runs for three hours, the length itself an acknowledgment of the director's ambitious aim. His visual guides to Lewis Carroll are John Tenniel, the most famous of Alice's illustrators, and Jim Henson puppets.,For his production, Mr. Willing has assembled an all-star company, then enlarged that cast with puppets -- and also transformed some of the actors into unearthly semblances of themselves. Martin Short, as the Mad Hatter, is perhaps the most Tennielesque of the principals; he becomes a large head on a tiny body. Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat is disembodied, finally only a feline smile floating in the skies. Ms. Goldberg's scenes were filmed in California, far away from the bulk of the work, which was done in London. Explaining his process, Mr. Willing said, ''I'm going to surgically glue her head on to an animatronic cat's body.'',A visit to the set at Shepperton Studios, where most of the film was made, could give only a limited impression of the intricacy of the production. A vast indoor space had been carpeted with grass to simulate the Queen's garden, and actors in vivid playing-card costumes were lined up for croquet duty. Much of the movie is computer-generated to supplement the live action. As Mr. Willing said, in many cases the actors had ''to act to thin air.'',The director, whose background was in animation before he turned to special effects, said there were about 650 special-effect shots in his film, some of them hallucinogenic. To help Mr. Willing reach his objective, the producers enlisted Peter Barnes, a playwright with his own expansive vision, to write the screenplay and tempted name actors to do cameos, including Gene Wilder as the Mock Turtle and Christopher Lloyd as the White Knight.,Because of the elaborate costumes and makeup, not all the actors are immediately identifiable as themselves. Blink, and one might miss Pete Postlethwaite cutting up as the Carpenter, or confuse Robbie Coltrane with George Wendt, pear-shaped twins as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. On the other hand, there is no mistaking Ben Kingsley's Caterpillar, or Major Caterpillar as he is called here, a personification of the English raj (an interesting switch for the man who played Gandhi).,Sitting in her dressing room, waiting to go on camera, Ms. Majorino seemed as confident as her character, as she explained the ''bluescreen'' process by which unusual backgrounds can be added to scenes after the fact: ''You have to be so accurate in what you do in movements and dialogue so that they can match it and 'paint' around you.'',This is certainly not the case in her scenes with Ms. Richardson. In an outsize gown, and with painted hair and a towering headdress, Ms. Richardson is a titanic figure, a follow-up to her last Hallmark venture, ''Merlin,'' in which she played two roles: the Lady of the Lake and Queen Mab. Here, one seems more than enough, as she puts on queenly airs with comic ferocity. ''We're all cutouts,'' she said. ''We're the cards brought to life.'',In his approach to ''Alice,'' Mr. Willing stressed fidelity to his source, while underlining the humor. ''I think 'Alice in Wonderland' is difficult to do well in a film, simply because it is a dream,'' he said. ''Shooting a dream, like recounting a dream, can be tedious. If I was to tell you about the one I had last night, you would probably fall asleep. The trick is to try and get to the essence of the story and to make it as entertaining as possible. What we're basically doing is amplifying the original, making the funny bits funnier and the spooky bits spookier. The key is to exploit the true fantasy that is Wonderland.'',''They're not afraid to go out on a limb,'' he said of the actors. ''You don't want them to go over the top, but you want to have the feeling that you have arrived in a place that is extraordinary.'',Behind the scenes at Shepperton, Henson puppets were aligned: flamingos and hedgehogs, a field of daisies, a gaggle of guinea pigs (the members of the Queen's jury) and, perhaps unseen, a slithy tove or two, silently awaiting the director's signal.",MEL GUSSOW,"FEB. 28, 1999",COVER STORY; Creating Fantasy That Is Wonderland,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/tv/cover-story-creating-fantasy-that-is-wonderland.html

"PEOPLE are chattering about real estate again. Maybe it is because our apartments seem smaller now that we are inside more, what with  cold weather and too many cops on the street, shooting people and taking away their cars. Maybe it is because there is less to talk about; impeachment is a memory, Rudy vs. Hillary is in the future and the recent personnel changes on the Knicks and  Yankees have yet to brighten our days.,Whatever the reason, everyone seems to have a story about absurdly expensive rents, ridiculously high sales prices, two-timing sellers, sleazy brokers, greedy landlords, predatory buyers, slow lenders and tenants violating rent-control and subsidy regulations. The worst villains are the co-op boards, those mean-spirited little cabals that stand between you and the space that will finally, truly, make you happy.,As you know, I am the president of a co-op board, five wonderful people as tight as the Giuliani administration, as smart as the Board of Education, as fierce in defense as the Patrolman's Benevolent Association. In this column's spirit of service, and just in case you dare to think you could qualify for a building as selective as mine, I hereby submit some of my observations on the proper criteria for judging whether you should be allowed in. It may help you prepare, or move to Montclair. The following does not necessarily reflect the thinking of other members of my board who, unfortunately, have minds of their own.,1.  It goes without saying that your numbers must crunch. Actually, it needs to be said. Too many people who report a $50,000 income claim to be able to carry $4,000 a month in maintenance and mortgage.,We are pretty laissez-faire in our building, willing to share space with people who can't afford to buy food, health insurance and cable, but we demand they have enough disposable cash to help re-carpet the hallways and pay our unfair sanitation tickets.,2.  Don't count on looks. Glamour could keep you out. While the occasional designer or almost-famous actor might make us feel sexy, there will eventually be problems. Success or scandal could bring paparazzi and mud on our new carpet. What if the tabloids report our new neighbor canoodling with someone equally news-unworthy? Most of us, including me, don't know what canoodling means, which makes us resentful that we are not doing it.,3.  Your pets will be interviewed. People owned by a large, shambling, Vermonty dog with a neckerchief or by several plump, judgmental cats will be given priority over those owned by yappy dogs small enough to be concealed in a Channel 13 tote bag.,4.  Your children will be interviewed. Boards realize that young teen-agers, however surly, will soon become old teen-agers who, however unmanageable, will soon be out of the house. When they return from college they may move back in forever, but they will have been beaten down, like the rest of us. Meanwhile, those cute babies will be around for years, wailing in the night, jumping in the elevator and pushing cookies, candy and potholders.,5.  Forget it if you are a stockbroker, especially one who depends on a Christmas bonus, on so-called emerging markets (which other tenants visit because they are poor countries) or on derivatives, which may be a form of canoodling.,6.  Don't even apply if you're a litigator. This not only includes the lawyers who sell their souls for Court TV appearances, but nonlawyers with a history of winning suits against dry cleaners, former lovers, cosmetic surgeons. Successful sue-birds will someday sue their neighbors. We understand they can't help themselves.,7.  You might have better luck as a freelance, despite an erratic income, if you are home a lot and can accept packages for board members in a building without doorman or super. In fact,  slovenly freelances who wear flip-flops in winter can pose as the super and discourage messengers from smoking joints in the basement. (That's how I rose to the top of the heap.) This does not apply to freelance writers, whom no board should take because they will write about their neighbors. They can't help themselves.,8.  A psychiatrist who treats mafiosi is persona non grata. With ''The Sopranos'' on HBO and the De Niro film ''Analyze This'' as social signposts, we can assume that many members of the dysfunctional Five Families are working out their relationships with their godfathers. Boards fear that law-enforcement agencies will break into the shrink files and disguise it as a junkie burglary. This could affect property values.,But if the numbers crunch, what board wouldn't accept a mafioso in therapy? Analyze that. A sensitive guy who can fix sanitation tickets? That's a perfect neighbor.",ROBERT LIPSYTE,"FEB. 28, 1999",COPING; Getting Good Neighbors: Pick Your Own,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/coping-getting-good-neighbors-pick-your-own.html

Many designers are represented, including Lilly Dache, Hattie Carnegie, John-Frederics, Christian Dior and Balenciaga.,The show contains a Paul Poiret creation from 1910, illustrating how big hats over big hair epitomized Edwardian elegance. Turbans gave an air of mystery to silent movie stars, and in the Roaring Twenties the cloche emerged.,In the 30's the tiny tricorne a la Empress Eugenie signaled the continuing shrinkage of the hat, perhaps epitomized by Jacqueline Kennedy's pillbox.,The museum, at 600 Main Street in downtown Hartford, is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 to 5.

"Facing a painful budget squeeze, Congress seems all but certain to increase the spending limits that have been a crucial component of fiscal discipline for the last decade, members of both parties say.,Despite the prospect of huge surpluses over the next decade, Congress is still operating under spending caps that tightly limit how much money can be allocated to the military and most domestic programs.,Because the caps will be far tighter for the budget year starting on Oct. 1 than they have ever been before -- and because both parties support spending increases for the Pentagon and for education, among other things -- Republicans and Democrats say there is no realistic way to avoid shattering the caps or resetting them at higher levels.,But both parties are reluctant to publicly admit that reality, fearing that they will be tagged as fiscally irresponsible just as the nation is shifting to an era of opportunities created by rapidly mounting Federal surpluses from one of crippling budget deficits.,''The caps have been a good thing because we haven't had to start each year debating how much to spend, only how to divide it up,'' said Martha Phillips, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group. ''If we go back to fighting over how much to spend, and people are saying that we have $4.8 trillion in surpluses, this could really get out of hand. If you don't have the caps it just makes it harder for politicians to do the right thing.'',The maneuvering over the spending caps comes as Congress prepares to begin work in earnest on a budget for next year. The budget committees that draw up broad spending guidelines and the appropriations committees that set spending levels for specific programs are facing unyielding arithmetic that leaves them unable to keep current programs fully financed, much less  add anything new, if the current limits are kept in place.,The caps for the coming budget year limit discretionary spending -- the one-third of the Federal budget that includes all annually appropriated programs, from the Pentagon to Head Start -- to $536 billion. (The rest of the budget is made up of mandatory spending on programs like Social Security and Medicare that are nonnegotiable obligations, plus interest payments on the Federal debt.),Just to keep programs running at their current levels by increasing financing only to account for inflation would put discretionary spending next year at $581 billion, or $45 billion over the limit, according to the Congressional Budget Office.,If financing were frozen at current dollar levels -- a cut, once inflation is taken into account -- spending would amount to $562 billion, or $26 billion over the limit, the budget office said. Even under the most optimistic scenario, stripping out all programs financed last year by one-time emergency spending and freezing spending for all other discretionary programs at current dollar levels, spending would be $546 billion, or $10 billion over the caps.,Both parties are already pushing for new spending. The Senate passed a bill this week, by a 91-to-8 vote, giving sweeping pay and pension increases to the military. The legislation would cost $1.6 billion next year and $55 billion over 10 years.,Both the House and the Senate plan to consider further increases in military spending, perhaps as much as $20 billion a year. Some Republicans are calling for sweeping increases in Federal spending on education, a cause long favored by Democrats. And a whole host of other issues, from aid to farmers to paying for the census and improving security at embassies abroad, are likely to draw varying degrees of bipartisan support.,''My party is committed to spending restraint,'' said a senior Republican aide involved in the appropriations process. ''But trying to build restraint into a system that is crying out for additional spending is very difficult.'',For all practical purposes, the caps were broken by Congress and the Clinton Administration in the budget they agreed to last fall for the current fiscal year. But they managed to remain within the spending limits on a technical basis by resorting to a variety of gimmicks, including labeling nearly $20 billion as emergency spending that is not subject to the caps.,The spending caps were first used informally in the late 1980's and were written into law as part of the deficit reduction package in 1990 under which President George Bush agreed to a tax increase. The caps were updated in the 1997 bipartisan agreement to balance the budget within five years.,The caps will bite particularly deeply next year because the 1997 budget deal postponed most of the fiscal pain for the last three years of the plan, meaning, in effect, that the promises of fiscal rectitude made two years ago are now coming due. The pain is being exacerbated because the gimmicks agreed to last fall pushed some of this year's spending onto next year's books.,Congress is also considering proposals to loosen another device intended to promote fiscal rectitude, known as the ''pay as you go'' rules. Those rules require that tax cuts be financed only by offsetting tax increases or by reductions in mandatory spending.,Many Republicans want to change those rules so that projected surpluses can be used to pay for tax cuts. Some Republicans have also discussed changing the rules to allow reductions in discretionary spending to be used to pay for tax cuts.,But the main focus in Congress now is on the spending caps. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois has been canvassing Republicans and some Democrats about whether the caps will have to be broken and if so whether it can be done without a partisan fight. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said he favored keeping the current caps in place.,The chairmen of the budget committees in both chambers, Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, are working on plans to stay within the caps by cutting spending in some areas even as they propose increases for the Pentagon and education.,''Mr. Kasich would strongly prefer to adhere to the caps,'' said Terry Holt, a spokesman for the House Budget Committee. ''If it can be done, if there is any possible way to do it, we are going to try and get it done.'',But the chairmen of the appropriations committees in both chambers, Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, and Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, have made clear that it will be all but impossible for them to operate within the caps. And some Republicans admit that it will be difficult to solve the problems through deep spending cuts, in part because their own party has little stomach for the political battle it would entail.,The budget proposal that President Clinton sent Congress earlier this month managed to propose a host of new programs and stay within the caps only by employing what Republicans called budgetary smoke and mirrors. An analysis by the Senate Budget Committee's Republican staff found that Mr. Clinton's budget would exceed the spending caps by $17.8 billion next year once what they described as legerdemain was stripped out.,Breaking or increasing the caps would effectively mean dipping into the budget surplus, which the Congressional Budget Office has estimated at $107 billion for the current fiscal year and $131 billion for next year.,But in both cases, the entire surplus comes from excess payroll taxes that are earmarked for Social Security. Factoring out Social Security, the Government will run a deficit of $19 billion this year and $7 billion next year, according to the budget office. Members of both parties are increasingly reluctant to dip into Social Security's money to pay for spending programs, although they did so freely for most of the last two decades.,Mr. Clinton has proposed using about 11 percent of the projected surpluses over the next 15 years, or about $500 billion, for increased domestic and military spending -- but only after Congress and the Administration agree on a plan to assure Social Security's long-term solvency.",RICHARD W. STEVENSON,"FEB. 28, 1999",Congress on Path To Approve a Rise In Spending Caps,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/congress-on-path-to-approve-a-rise-in-spending-caps.html
"FOR decades, developers have peered across the East River to Long Island City and envisioned a new central business district for the city, with high-rise buildings housing the back-office operations of companies whose headquarters are in expensive Manhattan.,After all, the location is a good one, just a few subway stops away from most locations in midtown. And as manufacturing has inexorably declined in the city, the old factory buildings that occupy much of the area have become available for conversion into offices or for demolition to provide building sites.,With the exception of the 50-story Citicorp tower that was erected a decade ago, it has not happened, despite the success of the Metrotech project in downtown Brooklyn, which attracted back-office operations from lower Manhattan.,Some change has come to the area. Big-box stores, such as Home Depot, Toys 'R' Us, Edwards Supermarket and Pergament Home Center, have moved in, many of them taking sites once occupied by industrial and distribution centers. Smaller stores like Old Navy and the Gap have located in the area as well, filling in the spaces between the anchor tenants.,Forest City Ratner Companies is building a 112,000-square-foot, 14-screen Regal cinema, one block off Steinway Street and almost in the shadow of the Kaufman Astoria Studios, where the Marx Brothers and other early stars made their movies in the 1920's and 1930's. Although the location is some distance from the shopping areas on Steinway Street, Bruce Ratner, the chief executive of the company, said he believes the complex's attractions will draw customers from outside the neighborhood.,''The boroughs are so under-movied that it is hard to make a mistake,'' Mr. Ratner said. ''We think people will travel to megaplexes.'' The movie complex will include stadium-style seating so there are no obstructed views, digital sound and small auditoriums, so films can continue to play there longer than in bigger theaters.,The big-box retailers and the movie theater project represent a successful conversion from industrial to a retail use, said Sanford H. Zuckerbrot, the president of Sholom & Zuckerbrot Realty, a brokerage firm in Long Island City. ''We are recycling these locations,'' he said.,Not all the industrial properties are being converted to other uses, however. Some are serving as havens for industries being displaced from other locations.,Mr. Zuckerbrot said one of the two Swingline factory buildings that were made available when its manufacturing was moved to Mexico last year will be largely leased to printing companies being pushed out of the Hudson Square area of southwestern Manhattan.,''This is an opportunity for a company that's paying $12 to $15 a square foot on the west side of Manhattan to come to Queens and pay $6.50 a square foot'' annually, Mr. Zuckerbrot said.,For some this is a natural economic development as property values and rents in Manhattan make it impossible for low-margin businesses to thrive. ''The printers can't survive in Manhattan,'' said Richard Maltz, chairman of Greiner-Maltz, a brokerage and management firm. He said he controls a building on Varick Street, in the heart of the old printing center, and is replacing the printers as their leases expire.,''I can't say to a guy, 'Pay me $20 a foot,' because I know within a year he'll be broke,'' Mr. Maltz said.,He said that new, high-tech tenants, such as MCI and Sprint, at the old Port Authority warehouse building at 111 Eighth Avenue, at 16th Street, in Manhattan were paying $20 a square foot annually, compared to under $10 a square foot that had been paid by the warehousing and distribution companies they replaced. . ''The low-end tenants get squeezed out,'' he said.,With office rents in Manhattan rising as well, some real estate executives say that Long Island City is the ideal location for lower-cost office space to avoid losing companies caught in a rent squeeze to the projects going up along the New Jersey waterfront. Nobody is putting any shovels in the ground yet, but some argue the pressure is building.,''I'M looking for Long Island City to come to life over the next two to five years,'' said James S. Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenants' broker. ''If that market does not sprout, New York is going to lose a large number of back-office jobs to New Jersey and Connecticut.'',He said he knows of companies with back-office operations occupying 4 million square feet that are looking to relocate outside Manhattan. Since effective office rents in the space available in Long Island City are typically under $20 a square foot, companies can make substantial savings by moving less-critical operations out of Manhattan, Mr. Meiskin said.,''I know a financial institution that is trying to move 500,000 square feet of back-office operations,'' he said. ''By doing so, they can save $30 a square foot, which is $15 million a year, $150 million over 10 years.'',Some are already making the move, according to Richard Karson, a senior managing director at the Insignia/ESG office in Long Island City. He is marketing the Queens Atrium Corporate Center on Thomson Avenue near Queens Boulevard.,The two-building complex contains 1 million square feet, of which 250,000 square feet have been rented. ''We'll do 300,000 square feet this year,'' said Mr. Karson, who said he had deals for 80,000 square feet and 200,000 square feet pending.,He said most of the tenants and prospects are back-office operations of insurance companies, health care managers and banks. Some communications companies, he said, are considering locating their switching centers there rather than in Manhattan.,He said that the government agencies developing Queens West, a tract of waterfront land facing across the river from the United Nations complex, are seeking developers for what could amount to 2 million square feet of new office space in the area. Currently, only Citylights, a 43-story residential building, has been built at Queens West, although Avalon Bay Communities, a real estate investment trust, has been designated to build the three remaining residential buildings of the first phase of the project.,The city is taking preliminary steps to make the area suitable for commercial development, said Thomas Knierim, executive director of the Long Island City Economic Development Corporation. ''There is a substantial rezoning proposal that is in the final stages of preliminary review,'' he said. Since much of the area is currently zoned for industrial use, the bulk of a building that could be built on a given parcel of land, called the floor-area ratio, or FAR, is limited.,The rezoning would increase that substantially in some locations, he said. ''In some places it would go from a FAR of 2 to 5 up to 12,'' he said.,The new zoning would cover a triangular 36-block area from Queens Plaza on the north to 23d Road on the west and Jackson Avenue to the Sunnyside rail yards to the east. ''That area has the potential to be a fourth central business district for the city,'' he said, after midtown and downtown Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn.,The new zoning, if approved, could permit the building of 10 million to 20 million square feet of new office buildings, Mr. Knierim said.,Some real estate executives say Long Island City will develop slowly, if at all, as an office center because an old factory area lacks the amenities, such as restaurants and shops, that office tenants prefer.,''Long Island City is different from Brooklyn, because Brooklyn has a well-defined downtown while Queens is all spread out,'' said Barry Rosner, a senior managing director of Williams Real Estate, a services company. ''And it lacks amenities. The city would be better off encouraging residential development along the Queens waterfront, where people would have a view of Manhattan and be a five-minute ferry ride away.'',Mr. Ratner, whose company developed Metrotech in Brooklyn, said that any developer seeking to build in Long Island City had better be patient and have deep pockets. He said the land in the designated downtown area has many different owners, so site assembly could be a problem without active help from the city. And, he said, environmental and land-use planning studies and approvals could drag on.,''You would probably have to do two or three years of predevelopment work,'' he said.",JOHN HOLUSHA,"FEB. 28, 1999",Commercial Property / Queens; Long Island City Still Waits for the Back Offices,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/realestate/commercial-property-queens-long-island-city-still-waits-for-the-back-offices.html
"ST. JOHN'S 79, SYRACUSE 62 St. John's had just put the finishing touches on a dominating performance yesterday, beating Syracuse to advance into the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament at Rutgers in Piscataway, N.J. But with Connecticut awaiting, there were no strong words, not even wistful dreams of what could be.,It was back in December, the first conference game of the year, when the young Red Storm lost by 40 points to the Huskies. But the memory of how even a banged-up Connecticut team could humble an inexperienced team was still raw yesterday. The Red Storm is gaining experience every day, but the Huskies are a far healthier, and far more dangerous, team than they were then.,The three top-seeded teams in the tournament -- Connecticut, Rutgers and Notre Dame -- all ranked among the top 10 in the nation, had the day off yesterday while the rest battled for the right to face them.,The opening round of the tournament saw victories by fourth-seeded Boston College over Seton Hall and fifth-seeded Georgetown over Pittsburgh, setting up one quarterfinal matchup. St. John's will face Connecticut at 2 P.M. today. Miami, an easy victor over West Virginia, will face second-seeded Rutgers at 6 P.M., and Notre Dame will face Villanova.,''With this young ball club, when you have young kids like this, all you can do is continue to encourage them,'' said Charlene Thomas-Swinson, the St. John's coach.,''It's a great opportunity for us to even be in the next phase of this, playing Connecticut,'' she added. ''I want them to just understand and appreciate that we've gone to another level and then hope that they're able to make the adjustments on the mental leap, so that we can take care of having a better round and playing against Connecticut tomorrow.'',After a shaky start in which it missed its first seven shots and fell behind by 5-0, the Red Storm blew by Syracuse and never let up. Leading by 10-9, St. John's ran off 19 consecutive points as Syracuse went 0 for 15 from the floor, missed four free throws and had 10 turnovers before finally scoring from the line with 1 minute 2 seconds left in the first half. The Red Storm, starting two freshmen and two sophomores alongside the senior Ebony Dickinson, led by 25 in the second half.,''I think we're developing,'' said Dickinson, who led St. John's with 15 points and 9 rebounds. But she was not about to guess that yesterday's victory meant the Red Storm was ready for the Huskies.,''I can't really say because we haven't played them.

"Coach Mike Jarvis was sanguine afterward, joking about the poor quality of the ball used in the game and insisting that he would like to send a letter to opposing coaches inviting them to play zone defense against St. John's. But the Red Storm's 66-60 loss to Villanova today, and the abysmal perimeter shooting and shot selection that accompanied it, are surely not the way Jarvis had hoped to enter the post-season.,No. 8 St. John's (23-7, 14-4 Big East) had won six games in a row since losing to Miami on Feb. 3. But it has had two of its worst shooting days of the season in its last two games, beating Notre Dame on Wednesday only because the Red Storm has better athletes. But against Villanova, which was playing to lock up an at-large berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, St. John's could not overcome a 2-1-2 zone with two Villanova big men clogging the lane, and its own shooting-happy impulses.,''When you're playing a good team on the road, you can't get behind like we did,'' Jarvis said. ''If this were an ordinary team, it would have been a 20-point win for Villanova.'',With Villanova's 7-foot-1-inch Rafal Bigus starting for just the seventh time in 18 league games (it was Senior Day) and the 6-10 Malik Allen, St. John's rarely penetrated the lane -- center Tyrone Grant took just five shots -- and settled for all manner of unwise shots.,During one first-half stretch, St. John's went scoreless for almost seven minutes. The Red Storm hit 31.9 percent from the field, making just 22 of 69 shots. Most came from well outside, including a season-high 31 3-point attempts. St. John's sank only eight. And because it so rarely got near the boards, the Red Storm was outrebounded, 42-38.,But Jarvis said it was not the zone that stymied his team against Villanova -- or against Notre Dame -- but merely St. John's poor execution.,''The other night against Notre Dame, it was more luck -- the ball didn't stay down,'' Jarvis said. ''Today, we did a very, very poor job of our selection, especially the quickness with which we shot. Early in the year, I told them when we shoot 15 or 16 threes, that's when we're at our best. We tried 31, and that's when we're at our worst. We violated one of the principles we've established -- not to overshoot the 3.'',Villanova (20-9, 10-8) had tried the same strategy against St. John's in their meeting at Madison Square Garden two weeks ago. But the Wildcats had not executed as well as in this game, when John Celestand scored 18 points and Allen and Brian Lynch each had 14.,In that first meeting, Grant's first game since returning from his broken wrist, St. John's had no trouble delivering the ball to him, and he had 14 points and 17 rebounds. Villanova Coach Steve Lappas, though, did not abandon his plan, and this time Grant had only 4 points.,St. John's tied the score at 58-58 with 1 minute 58 seconds remaining on a flurry of scoring by Erick Barkley, who had 12 of his 19 points in a five-minute span midway through the second half. Allen hit a seven-foot turnaround jumper over Grant to give Villanova the lead again. And when Villanova abandoned the zone for a man defense, and St. John's got the ball to Grant underneath, he missed a layup that would have tied the score with 1:10 remaining.,After a timeout, Villanova ran a play to get the ball inside to Allen. Again, he spun around and shot over Grant, giving the Wildcats a 62-58 lead with 40.7 seconds left, and St. John's would not recover.,Perhaps a less confident coach would have been quaking at the specter of opposing teams getting their hands on this tape before the Big East tournament begins. Jarvis, though, reverted to a theme that has defined this season: this ugliness, like all the pretty games St. John's has also played, would serve as a learning experience.,''I'm concerned because today we took an exam and we didn't pass,'' Jarvis said. ''And that means the next exam, we need a B-plus or an A. I know this team is capable of that.'',REBOUNDS,With its victory over Rutgers, Miami locked up at least the second seeding, meaning St. John's is seeded third in the Big East tournament. St. John's gets a first-round bye and on Thursday will face the winner of the game between No. 6-seeded Rutgers and No. 11 Pittsburgh in a 9 P.M. game. . . .

"With less than 30 seconds remaining in today's game, and with Rutgers very much alive, Geoff Billet stole a pass and dribbled toward the Miami basket. A 3-point shot would tie the Hurricanes, but Billet elected to get the points another way -- go for the layup and hope to get fouled.,The senior point guard didn't get either. His shot was blocked by Tim James and no foul was called, though Billet thought one was justified with 21.8 seconds left and 11th-ranked Miami clinging to a 66-63 lead.,''It was a physical play -- it seemed like a lot of contact,'' Billet said after the Scarlet Knights lost a heartbreaker, 68-63, at Miami Arena before 10,497, the fourth-largest crowd in the Hurricanes' history.,Still, Rutgers was not finished until James blocked another Billet shot, this one a 3-point attempt. Billet is the most prolific 3-point shooter in Scarlet Knights history, prompting Miami Coach Leonard Hamilton to say of James: ''I don't where he came from on that play. All I know is we needed the block.'',James, whose No. 40 jersey was retired by Miami before the game, then made two free throws after being fouled with 2.3 seconds left. Only then had Miami finally shaken the resilient visitors.,The Scarlet Knights (17-11, 9-9 Big East) head into the conference tournament on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden with a four-game losing streak.,''I feel a lot better about my team after today,'' Rutgers Coach Kevin Bannon said. ''I'm not like that after a defeat, but I feel like these kids are going to go into the Big East tournament with a chip on their shoulder. And I still feel we can be an N.C.A.A. team.'',Forward Rob Hodgson said the Rutgers players were looking forward to winning at least two conference tournament games to make the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament selection committee's job a slam dunk.,''A lot of positive things happened today,'' Hodgson said. ''We played more back to ourselves.'',This was Miami's eighth straight Big East victory. If Connecticut is upset on Sunday by Syracuse, Miami (21-5, 15-3) will earn the No. 1 seeding in the conference tournament.,Hamilton called Rutgers an N.C.A.A. tournament-worthy team.,''I'd much rather we had won by 50,'' Hamilton said. ''That way, everybody would be laughing and high-fiving. But they played us tough. That's the way it is in the Big East, where two or three possessions can make a difference in the game.'',The Scarlet Knights fought back from a 17-point second-half deficit to pull within 3 points on two occasions.,''I'm just proud of the way we came back,'' Billet said. ''Now we need to bring the same effort and play a little better.'',Because of his team's recent slump, Bannon chose not to start his two freshman regulars -- center Rashod Kent and guard Dahntay Jones. Replacing them were the 6-foot-11-inch Alvydas Tenys and another freshman, Billy Collins, who was making his first start.,The moves worked for a while, as the Scarlet Knights got off to a good start. Jeff Greer (a team-high 22 points) and Hodgson (13 points) clicked on 3-pointers to open the game, and their defense forced Miami into missing its first half-dozen shots. The Hurricanes did not score until 4 minutes 10 seconds had elapsed, on a jumper by James, who had 14 points.,Yet neither team could muster much offense. With 8:18 gone, Rut gers clung to a football-like 13-7 lead.,Kent entered the game in the last four minutes of the half, but missed 3 of 4 free throws as Miami built a 24-21 margin that became 32-27 by halftime.,In the second half, Miami began to assert itself. Johnny Hemsley quickly hit a pair of 3-pointers while James contributed an alley-oop dunk, a tip-in and a jumper.,When the Scarlet Knights looked up, they were behind, 54-37.,''They took it up a notch for about an eight-minute span there,'' Bannon said. ''But my guys kept hustling, and good things started to happen.'',Particularly with Greer, a sophomore guard from the Bronx, who scored 12 points in the second half. ''I just want to help the team win,'' Greer said. ''Today we needed scoring. Other days it's going to be rebounding, and other days it's just going to be sitting on the bench and letting somebody else play.'',Bannon said that when Greer drives to the basket, as he did periodically today, the Scarlet Knights can be dangerous. He'll find out soon how accurate that assessment is.",CHARLIE NOBLES,"FEB. 28, 1999",COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Rutgers Finds Hope In a Tough Defeat,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/college-basketball-rutgers-finds-hope-in-a-tough-defeat.html
"MARIST 71, IONA 69 Marist has earned a reputation for having outstanding guards and serviceable frontcourt players. Last night its backcourt proved fatal for Iona in a quarterfinal of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament at Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo.,Bo Larragan sailed in a 3-pointer with five seconds left to propel sixth-seeded Marist (16-11) to victory. Bobby Jo Hatton, Marist's other guard, stuffed a shot by Javar Cheatham at the buzzer.,''We set up a play for Bobby Jo with a safety of Bo coming off the high screen, and once he took the shot we knew he had it all the way,'' Marist Coach Dave Magarity said. The Red Foxes will face Siena in the semifinals today.,Opening-night jitters cost Iona (16-14). With every turnover, Iona negated the good things it had done, such as posting up for easy baskets against the Red Foxes' inferior front line and harassing Marist into long jump shots.,Third-seeded Iona never found a pocket of calm, even after it had built an 11-point lead late in the game.,In the first half, Iona shot 57 percent, but 11 turnovers left it with just a 42-37 lead. Iona stretched the lead to 63-52 on a 6-0 run capped by Leland Norris's 3-pointer. Marist inched back on 3-pointers by Larragan and forward Tomasz Cielebak, then had two free throws and a 3-pointer by Larragan after a technical foul was called on Phil Grant for pushing another player. Marist trailed by 67-66 with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining.,Kashif Hameed countered with a basket to make it 69-66 in favor of Iona with 1:50 to go. After Tariq Kirksay missed the front end of a one-and-one, Sean Kennedy guided in a running jumper to pull Marist back within 69-68 with 40 seconds left. Hameed missed a short jump shot on Iona's next possession, and after Marist rebounded a miss by Larragan, it called a timeout with 19 seconds left.,Hatton tried working around Iona's Jason Young, then passed to Larragan, who squared up for his winning 21-footer.,Larragan finished with 17 points and Hatton added 14.

"CHAPEL HILL, N.C., Feb. 27 -- All that stood between top-ranked Duke and a perfect regular season in the Atlantic Coast Conference was North Carolina, its neighborhood rival. And for a little more than a half, it appeared the Tar Heels were up to the task of  thwarting the Blue Devils.,But Duke merely kicked its performance into a higher gear, as it has all season, and broke away for an 81-61 victory.,Duke improved its record to 29-1 as it won for the 24th straight time, a school record. The Blue Devils' only loss came in late November against Cincinnati in the final of the Great Alaska Shootout.,The Devils also finished 16-0 in the A.C.C., the first team to do so since the conference expanded to nine teams in 1991-92. Duke has been so dominant, its average victory margin in A.C.C. play is 24.3 points. Duke is fueled by the nation's most potent offense -- it leads Division I in scoring (93.7) and scoring margin (25.7), and is second in field-goal percentage (51.7).,Seven previous A.C.C. teams had gone undefeated in league play in the regular season, most recently North Carolina in 1987.,''I can't remember a team that has been such an odds-on favorite to win the national championship as they are,'' said Bill Guthridge, the North Carolina coach. ''They're just really, really something.'',North Carolina, in contrast, has been erratic this season, relying heavily on young players and enduring a series of injuries that disrupted the lineup. The Tar Heels survived overtime to win their two previous games, against Virginia and Wake Forest.,North Carolina fell to 22-8, 10-6. It was the most decisive defeat at the Smith Center for the Tar Heels since the building opened in January 1986.,There were five lead changes and four ties in the first half as neither team was ahead by more than a basket in the first 12 minutes. Then Duke went on a 10-1 run to open a 29-20 edge with 5 minutes 30 seconds left in the half.,North Carolina responded with 7 straight points and trailed by just 35-33 at halftime. When Brendon Haywood, North Carolina's 7-foot, 263-point center, opened the second half with an inside basket, the score was tied at 35-35 with 19:17 to go.,Duke answered with an 11-2 run, sparked by the playmaker William Avery. Avery, a sophomore, finished with a game-high 24 points and largely contained the penetration of Tar Heel guard Ed Cota.,''I know if he's not going,'' Avery said, referring to Cota, ''Carolina's not going.'',After two North Carolina baskets that pulled it to within 46-41 with 12:34 to go, Duke broke the game open, scoring 22 of the next 28 points.,While the Blue Devils scored repeatedly inside and off the dribble, the Tar Heels were reduced to jump shots. They made 31 percent from the floor in the second half.,''I just think we rebounded so well,'' Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said, ''and we played good defense.'',The Blue Devils had not won at Chapel Hill since 1991, a fact that was weighing heavily on the minds of several veteran Blue Devils before the game.,Chris Carrawell, a Duke junior, called the game a statement and  payback for a 24-point rout administered here by the Tar Heels last season.,''We wanted to win on their home floor,'' said Carrawell, who had 12 points and 8 rebounds. ''The best thing about tonight was walking off and hearing silence, walking off and not hearing those fans say anything.'',The key to achieving that result was Duke's surprising dominance on the boards. The Blue Devils held a 52-36 edge, with 22 offensive rebounds compared with 11 for the Tar Heels.,North Carolina came into the game leading the nation in rebounding margin and holding a decisive size advantage. The Blue Devils also were without one of their best defenders and rebounders, the 6-8 forward Shane Battier, who was sidelined with a sprained ankle.,''That's the last thing I expected, for us to outrebound them in their house,'' said Trajan Langdon, Duke's senior guard, who had 11 points. ''I think we're a very athletic team, we're very quick to the ball.'',Bolstering Duke was the 6-6 freshman Corey Maggette, a reserve who primarily played power forward. He contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds in 22 minutes.,Elton Brand, Duke's sophomore center, added 17 points and a game-best 13 rebounds, 7 on offense.,Haywood led North Carolina with 16 points before fouling out.",BARRY JACOBS,"FEB. 28, 1999",COLLEGE BASKETBALL; Duke Makes Things Clear in A.C.C.,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/college-basketball-duke-makes-things-clear-in-acc.html

"Makers of cars and child safety seats will be required to adopt a common means of attaching the devices as part of an effort to save the lives of dozens of children each year, President Clinton said today.,''All too often car seats don't protect children as well as they should,'' Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address, from Los Angeles, where the President was to attend a fund-raiser.,With the new rule, he said, ''we can save lives and prevent up to 3,000 injuries per year.'',Federal safety authorities estimate that 70 percent of all car seats, which are held in place by a vehicle's seat belt, are improperly installed.,''Most seat belts were not designed to hold car seats, and not all hundred models of car seats can fit on all 900 types of vehicles on our road today,'' Mr. Clinton said.,The President said that by 2000, the United States Transportation Department would require all child safety seats to be made with a standard three-point attachment system, and would require all new cars and light trucks to have two of the anchors in their back seats.,The new rule will prevent as many as 50 deaths a year, the White House said in a fact sheet accompanying the radio address.,Mr. Clinton said that since 1975, as use of child safety seats has grown, the devices have saved about 4,000 lives. During a three-year phase-in period, the new child safety seats will also be able to be installed using regular seat belts.,The new standards were recommended by a panel of medical and safety experts, seat manufacturers and consumer groups.,Mr. Clinton singled out one member of that panel, Joe Colella, executive director of the Dana Foundation, who has been lobbying for a universal model since his 3-year-old niece, Dana, was killed in a 1993 crash. She was in a car seat that was incompatible with the seat belts in her family's car, Mr. Clinton said.,''Anyone who has struggled to get a car seat to fit snugly into a back seat knows exactly what I'm talking about,'' he said.,The President repeated his recommendation that states tighten their standards for drunken-driving convictions and adopt blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.08 percent ''to keep more drunk drivers off our roads.'' Many states now set their level at 0.10 percent.,Congress last year defeated an effort to push states to make that change.,The Government estimates a 137-pound woman who drinks three beers in two hours could have a blood alcohol content of 0.07, while drinking four beers over the same time period could push her to 0.10.",REUTERS,"FEB. 28, 1999",Clinton Announces New Child Seat Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/us/clinton-announces-new-child-seat-rules.html

"The City News Bureau, the century-old training ground for young Chicago reporters, was to close next week but instead will be refashioned as a smaller operation.,Plans to close the news bureau were announced late last year by its co-owners, The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times. But because The Tribune was unhappy with service offered by two competing public relations companies, the newspaper decided to go it alone and support a pared-down version of the bureau. The operation will be named New City News Service, beginning on Monday.,''We decided that a certain type of service was necessary and we developed what we felt was necessary for what we needed and what our associates needed,'' said an associate editor of The Tribune, Joe Leonard, who is helping to start the news service.,''It will be run as other divisions under the Chicago Tribune editorial department,'' Mr. Leonard added.,With a staff cut to 18 from 44 last year, the new service will trim its 24-hour, daily coverage, concentrating on where local ''radio and television are weakest,'' the night police beat, the city, suburban and Federal courts and City Hall, said Paul Zimbrakos, who will head the service.,''We're highly regarded as a training ground'' for local reporters who cut their teeth on the humdrum police and local-government beats before moving on to bigger things, said Mr. Zimbrakos, a 41-year bureau veteran.,Among alumni of what veterans call the school of hard knocks are several Pulitzer Prize winners and the likes of Mike Royko, the late Chicago columnist; Seymour M. Hersh, the investigative reporter, and the novelist Kurt Vonnegut.,Over the years, this rigorous boot camp of journalism, which relied on subscriptions paid by other news organizations, has drilled legions of cub reporters, instilling in them its famous motto: ''If your mother says she loves you, go check it out.'',In announcing the shutdown of City News last year, the co-owners said the struggling service had suffered losses of about $1 million in 1997 and was expected to continue losing money for the next three to four years.,The service was begun in 1890 by 20 local newspaper publishers as a cooperative to cover the police beat at night.

"In response to criticism that his chief strength in chess is openings research, in which he is helped by a team of grandmasters, Garry Kasparov stated that his forte is not in openings but in middle-game tactics. To prove his point, one has only to look at his tour de force against the Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov last month in Round 4 of the Hoogoven International Tournament in Wijk-aan-Zee, the Netherlands.,Kasparov did not do well in the opening. Despite his having White and the advantage of moving first, he got nowhere. But then, simply amazing, he conjured up a shower of arrows to engulf his opponent. It is one of the most scintillating games of recent years.,The Classical System offshoot against the Pirc Defense that Kasparov was setting up with 6 f3 was nicely met by 6 . . . b5; any thought by White of aggression in the center would find Black ready for a queenside counterattack.,Topalov had wisely delayed castling on the kingside, so Kasparov's 8 Bh6 Bh6 9 Qh6 had little effect. After 13 . . . O-O-O, the black king was safe on the other wing.,After 21 Rhe1, Topalov could have shown that Kasparov's opening play had gained no advantage for White and was thus a failure. Thus, 21 . . . de 22 fe Ne4 23 Rd8 Nc3 24 bc Qd8 25 Qf7 Kb8 26 Qf4 Ka7 27 Qf7 Ka7 will produce perpetual check. But he went for more with 21 . . . d4, unwittingly unleashing Kasparov's tactical genius.,Topalov had not calculated the almost incalculable 22 Nd5! He saw enough to back away from 22 . . . Nfd5? 23 ed Qd6 24 Qf7 Kb8 25 Re6 Qc7 26 Re7 Nd7 27 Nc6 Bc6 28 dc Qc6 29 Bd7, which wins a piece. But after 22 . . .

Bd5 25 Qd6 Rd6 26 Rd3 c4 27 Rde3 Kb6 28 b4 cb 29 Nb3 was the correct course, but Topalov, unaware of the depth of the danger, snapped up the rook with 24  . . . cd?,With 25 Re7!, Kasparov offered a second rook, but this one was also  hands off: thus 25 . . .

"Believe it or not, there is more to spring in Washington than the arrival of the cherry blossoms. True, they make a spectacular ring around the tidal basin, lining the Capital's most refreshing jogging path and providing the perfect setting for early-evening picnics that replicate the ohanami parties the Japanese revel in, half a world away.,But the real signs come before the blossoms open, along the back trails of Rock Creek Park, which starts as a sliver down by the Potomac River, and widens like a green funnel as it cuts up through northwest Washington and into Maryland. Rock Creek itself swells with the spring rains, and suddenly the trails that lead uphill toward the Dumbarton Oaks Gardens in upper Georgetown are alive with birds and color. Along the Potomac, the first hardy sailors and sculling enthusiasts slip into the gray waters. And, if you stand in Arlington National Cemetery and look back at the District, blocking out the buildings with the emerging leaves and a bit of imagination, you might see the landscape the way it looked to George Washington when, sitting on horseback, he scoped out ''10 miles square'' for the new nation's proposed capital.,Perhaps the surest whispers of spring, though, emanate from the National Zoo, built into a long slope in the valley of Rock Creek. Each day, a few more of the 5,800 animals venture out into the sun, ending their long winter confinement. And, a few miles away, equally gradually, the lawyers and the lobbyists, the journalists and the Capitol Hill aides emerge from their glass-and-marble cages, weary of a winter of scandal, to lunch in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, or to have coffee at the cafe tables that suddenly begin to populate Connecticut Avenue.",DAVID E.

"In Toronto, where the winters are fairly mild by Canadian standards -- this last one was an exception -- getting to the threshold of spring usually feels like having dodged yet another icy bullet.,Still, as the bland, gray days pile up, and the sky and the lake often take on roughly the same hue, there's a longing for the warming rays of a high sun.,Then one day, a breeze that is not frigid slips through downtown streets, followed by an improbable whiff of grass and deep water. The towers of commerce sparkle, and some hearty Canadian soul in shirt sleeves proclaims the arrival of spring.,After this, well before it is prudent, Torontonians strip off their parkas and huddle together around small sidewalk tables at the endless Greek restaurants on Danforth Avenue, the cafes of Little Italy or the bistros of Yorkville.,Like the returning Canada geese, they are driven by instinct to the water. Harborfront Center on Lake Ontario, a few steps from downtown, is revived by the sun's rays, and there are festivals and music and shows almost every weekend in spring and summer. Around the small lake in High Park, in the city's western end, thousands of cherry trees erupt in a gorgeous, but achingly brief, riot of pink and white blossoms, lifting spirits.,And though it is not well known, Toronto also is a city of beaches, with a wooden boardwalk, in the eastern section, that overflows with people and dogs on warm spring days. At Easter time, on the main street through The Beaches, as the neighborhood is known, there is a small but spirited Easter parade, the kind with human-size bunnies and chintzy floats, that thoroughly banishes any memories of the gray winter.",ANTHONY DEPALMA,"FEB. 28, 1999",Catching Up With Spring Around the World; TORONTO,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/catching-up-with-spring-around-the-world-toronto.html
"Traditionally, the Japanese have lived in paper-thin houses (although many now reside in modern apartment buildings). So when the winter frost melts into spring, warm weather is definitely something to celebrate. And they do, en masse.,In ancient times, they made way for spring by calling in diviners to drive away evil spirits, or by throwing paper dolls into the ocean. These days, people display real dolls in their homes to celebrate happiness, but in some small towns, villagers still toss the paper images into the river to capture the demons before spring arrives.,Only then can the time for renewal commence. And when it does, as the cherry blossoms open throughout Tokyo, the Japanese start afresh. Companies bring in new recruits and settle business accounts. Students start the school year.,There is about one week of ephemeral beauty in Tokyo -- the city's blossoms last just that long -- toward the end of March or early April. So in an annual rite of spring, everyone slips out of work to join wine-soaked picnics under the white and buoyant cherry trees. Women replace their somber kimonos with brightly patterned ones -- at least those, mostly older, who still wear kimonos. And the colors of the delicate Japanese cakes, cooked in the shapes of flowers, change from reds and dark greens to pastel pinks.,The Blossom Forecast begins in early March, even in February, on national radio and television as people try to map out the best days and the best sites for viewing the flowers. Starting with the plum trees, on to cherry trees and then,to apple, the Blossom Front moves through Tokyo, and then continues north throughout all of Japan. There are flowering fruit trees in gardens, in parks, by rivers, near shrines. And Tokyo's green lawns turn into a carpet of people in revelry.",SHERYL WUDUNN,"FEB. 28, 1999",Catching Up With Spring Around the World; TOKYO,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/catching-up-with-spring-around-the-world-tokyo.html
"All Romans complain all the time, but spring ushers in a whole new effusion of lament. Fatigue, sneezing and aches are all attributed to occasional rains, pollen and the change of seasons, which in Italy is so gentle it can barely be detected. By April, balmy winter begins slipping into balmy summer. Romans mostly view the months in between as a nasty health hazard.,Food, therefore, becomes the main consolation. Finicky Romans who have made do all winter with Chilean tomatoes and greenhouse artichokes begin roaming the open-air markets in search of fruits and vegetables grown close to home. First come the strawberries, from Terracina, a city some 60 miles southeast of Rome. Then the cherries, which in April begin to slip in from Sicily, then from Puglia and, finally, from orchards near the capital. Then the asparagus, from Campania, a few miles from Naples.,Cheese in Italy is made all year round, but in the spring, the cows are fed fresh forage, so the cheese has a fresher taste that Archimede Sabelli, a cheese maker, solemnly described as ''the reawakening of the mountain and the heart.'' Some cheeses, like fresh ricotta, cannot be found after January because the ewes' milk is reserved for their newborn lambs. (After Easter, when all the baby lambs have been slaughtered for the holiday feast, ricotta is back on the shelves.),Still, those harbingers are few. When Romans are not complaining about their spring headaches, they wax regretful for the old signs of seasonal change that have been lost to modern technology. ''Freesia and tulips should only be found in spring,'' said Stefano, a flower vendor in Campo dei Fiori. ''But sadly, nowadays they can be found all year round.''",ALESSANDRA STANLEY,"FEB. 28, 1999",Catching Up With Spring Around the World; ROME,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/catching-up-with-spring-around-the-world-rome.html
"Snowdrops are the celebrated harbinger of a Russian spring, although these modest white flowers don't put in much of an appearance in cities like Moscow. But the same word also applies to another sign -- private automobiles, which after a winter spent in hibernation, wrapped in burlap bags or plastic sheets, covered in several months' worth of snow, creep back onto the streets on the first truly warm days, puffing and chugging as they clear their pipes for the season ahead.,The practice of taking cars off the road for the winter might seem a bit odd in a country where winter lasts from, roughly, October through April. But that's what many car owners did in Soviet times, when a car was a prized possession.,These days, since spare parts are easier to come by, gasoline is still cheap and now there are car washes throughout the city, the four-wheeled snowdrops are becoming a thing of the past.,Yet Moscow still fills up with cars in the springtime. Sun and warmth have that effect on Russians: just like the old babushkas who come out and resume their places on the nearest bench, so automobiles seem to flock together as soon as the last snow melts.,The best of a Moscow spring comes at the end, in mid- to late May, when the lilacs are in full bloom. Ranging from the milkiest violet to the deepest purple, lilacs are everywhere in the city: on the side of the hill below the Pashkov House opposite the Kremlin, along the park-lined Boulevard Ring, in the scruffy courtyards behind the mammoth apartment blocks.,Outside, in the villages, the babushkas, energized by a month of bench-sitting, cut lilacs from the bushes in their tiny gardens, collect them in buckets and sell them by the armful to passing motorists.",CELESTINE BOHLEN,"FEB. 28, 1999",Catching Up With Spring Around the World; MOSCOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/catching-up-with-spring-around-the-world-moscow.html
"Winters in Houston are, by Northeast standards, an almost balmy affair. But there still is, even here, a palpable longing for spring, when the weather can be relied upon to be nearly perfect, day after glorious day, and the summer swelter, which lasts unabated from late May until October, has yet to arrive.,Winter's end is heralded by the arrival of the first of the trail riders. Dozens of horseback-riding groups converge on the city, setting up camp in Memorial Park, near Buffalo Bayou, west of downtown. They come for the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, Feb. 19 to March 7 this year. For two weeks, the nation's fourth-largest city, diverse and cosmopolitan, becomes rodeo crazy. Even in the downtown skyscrapers, it's not uncommon to see businessmen having power lunches in cowboy boots and Stetsons. A lot of people have special ''rodeo outfits'' in their closets, which they only bring out for these two weeks.,Rodeo season is closely followed by the first flowering of the redbud trees in mid-March, their small magenta petals suddenly appearing all over the city. The redbuds arrive like a trumpet blast: It's really spring now. Gradually, plant by plant, flower by flower, the gaudy colors remind everyone that the Texas Gulf Coast is, to a large extent, a semitropical clime. The highlight of the season is the annual Azalea Trail put on by the River Oaks Garden Club. On two weekends -- March 6-7 and 13-14 this year -- the gardens of Bayou Bend, the former home of the Houston heiress Ima Hogg, and of more than a half-dozen other grand mansions are opened to the public, just as the azaleas are at their blazing brightest.,No Houston spring is complete, either, without at least one trip into the nearby countryside to see the wildflowers, which grow in mind-boggling abundance all around Texas. Every household has its own special itinerary, and it is a rare Houston family that does not have at least one picture of the kids sitting in the middle of a vast field of bluebonnets.",RICK LYMAN,"FEB. 28, 1999",Catching Up With Spring Around the World; HOUSTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/catching-up-with-spring-around-the-world-houston.html

"Last November, the California Republican Party suffered its worst defeat in 40 years, losing races for Governor, United States Senator and nearly every other statewide office, and shrinking its minority by five seats in the State Assembly and two in the Senate. So as party regulars gathered for their winter convention here this weekend, still licking their wounds and spoiling for fights over abortion and their future leadership, a certain gallows humor prevailed.,''We've got this circular firing- squad thing just about perfected,'' said Dan Schnur, once an aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson and one of the state's snappier wordsmiths, who dryly referred to the latest round of clashes between the party's moderate and conservative wings here as an exercise in ''semiannual self-immolation.'',And because this is California, crucible of trends, with its newly moved-up Presidential primary election on March 7, 2000, there was no shortage of interested witnesses to the festivities. A parade of half a dozen Presidential contenders arrived to press the flesh and test the waters in a climate of soul-searching that seemed emblematic of the party's internal post-impeachment struggles around the nation.,''I hate to admit it, but what happens in California happens in the West; it's the 800-pound gorilla,'' said Senator John McCain of Arizona, who warned the delegates on Friday night: ''Scorched-earth Republican primaries will lead directly to an Al Gore Presidency, and to Democratic control of one or both houses of Congress. Don't let us go down the road of mindlessly destroying each other.'',Mr. McCain made no direct mention in his speech of the California Republicans' current fight: a rare contested election for party chairman and vice chairman, driven in large measure by differences over abortion. But in an interview afterward, he acknowledged that he was ''keenly aware of the battles that are going on in this convention.'',The latest battle flared last month when the party's current vice chairman, John McGraw, a Silicon Valley software executive who would normally be a shoo-in for the top post, was quoted in a San Francisco Roman Catholic publication describing ''killing our babies'' as ''the issue of the century.'' He later said his views reflected his ''personal moral priorities'' and not those of his party.,But the party's gubernatorial nominee, former State Attorney General Dan Lungren, a staunch opponent of abortion, lost to Gray Davis by 20 points last November.,Today, in one of his rare post-election appearances, Mr. Lungren told the delegates: ''We ought not to hang our heads in shame.'' But his own campaign manager has said that it would be difficult for any Republican who opposes abortion rights to win the governorship. So party moderates decided to mount the first challenge in a chairman's race in 28 years.,''It's suicidal,'' said Bob Larkin, an insurance agent from Simi Valley and former chairman of the Ventura County party, who notes that the state party has lost 600,000 members since 1990, going from nearly 40 percent of the state's registered voters to just under 35 percent. ''The right wing doesn't care if they lose. They'd rather be right and pure. But we're losing members at the rate of 415 a day. We'll lose more Republicans over the time of this convention than will be here as delegates.'',Mr. Larkin and other moderates are supporting a rump slate of Nicholas Bavaro, a Modesto businessman, for the two-year term of chairman, and former Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, a winery owner and heir to the Firestone tire fortune from Santa Barbara County, for vice chairman. Mr. Firestone lost a bitter Congressional primary last year to a fellow Assemblyman, Tom Bordonaro, who harshly attacked Mr. Firestone's support for abortion rights and gun control but then went on to lose the general election to the Democratic candidate, Lois Capps.,''That showed me an example of a party being ineffective, and, yes, part of what I'm trying to do is prevent that from happening to anyone else,'' Mr. Firestone said.,Because party rules stipulate that the next chairman must come from the northern part of the state, Mr. Firestone could not run for chairman this time. But he is given some chance of defeating Shawn Steel, a conservative lawyer from Beverly Hills, in the voting on Sunday for vice chairman, thus positioning himself to run for chairman the next time around. Meanwhile, Mr. McGraw and his conservative faction are still expected to defeat the moderate Mr. Bavaro for the chairmanship.,In an interview on Friday night, Mr. McGraw, 36, said he believed his remarks on abortion had been misconstrued, but insisted, ''I have that behind me now,'' and said he was determined to send a message of tolerance. ''I'm a neophyte at this, and that was not the most politic statement,'' he said, adding that part of the party's self-examination was the natural consequence of defeat. ''Hey, we got a whipping,'' he said. ''Nothing easy about it. But what are you going to do? Quit?'',The party's differences over issues from abortion to gun control, affirmative action and the environment are nothing new. In fact, they persisted in the eight-year tenure of Mr. Wilson, whose support for abortion rights and acceptance of a tax increase to close a crushing budget gap early in his first term rankled many conservatives. But because of Mr. Wilson's powers as titular head of the party, he was able to paper over the disagreements to some degree.,''We've always had these problems, but because we had the governorship and a staff that worked really hard to keep the tensions below the surface, they haven't popped up,'' said State Senator Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, regarded as one of the party's cannier hands, who has endorsed both Mr. Firestone and Mr. Steel.,Leslie Goodman, a former Wilson aide who is close to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a no-show at the gathering here, said, the state party ''has to decide that winning is more important than ideology.,''We ought to be coming together to nominate the strongest possible national candidate to play and win in California,'' she said.,But not everyone at the convention was singing that tune. The California Young Americans for Freedom distributed Day-Glo yellow fliers denouncing ''Vichy Republicans'' for being willing to ''surrender'' on abortion, ''capitulate'' on gun control, ''run away'' from school vouchers and ''abandon the elephant mascot and replace it with a mule.'',Mr. McCain said he had tried to communicate to the delegates that ''it isn't just the message; it's the way we deliver the message,'' and in the interview he expressed distress that the party's core message of lower taxes, smaller government, deregulation and the like had lately been overshadowed by more divisive issues. ''You've got to not only say these things,'' he said, ''but you've got to say it in an inclusive way.''",TODD S. PURDUM,"FEB. 28, 1999",California G.O.P.

"IT'S hard to think of a more iconic product than Levi's jeans. Or of an iconic company that has been stuck in a slump as long as has Levi Strauss & Company, the privately held San Francisco clothing maker that has been losing market share to upstart brands and private labels.,Last week, Levi's announced that it would lay off 5,900 workers, close 11 plants and shift manufacturing overseas to cut costs.,Experts are not convinced that Levi's has done enough to restore its fortunes -- but entrepreneurs, marketing experts, consultants and academic researchers who were asked how the company could put some starch back in its flagship brand were eager to offer advice.,Here are a few perspectives.,RUSSELL SIMMONS -- Hip-hop impresario and chairman of Phat Fashions Inc., maker of Phat Farm jeans.,We are in a logo-driven business. When Run-D.M.C. said to Calvin Klein, ''Don't want your name on my behind,'' they were talking about what clothes say in the urban community. The fact that there are so many lines now -- Fubu, Mecca, Phat Farm -- means nothing for Levi's except to reaffirm that cultural statements are made through clothes.,In a way, Levi's is my main competition, along with the Gap and Old Navy. But those brands say ''We're functional; we're rugged,'' and that used to mean ''We're cool.'' Not today. Today it represents being safe. Levi's ain't fly.,No matter what they,do, Levi's can't turn itself into an aspirational brand tomorrow. If chase an audience you don't understand -- and patronize it -- you can hurt yourself. What you do has to be smart and subtle and organic. Levi's sponsoring a rap tour, that's not the way. It is not honest; nobody believes that. You can try to buy cool, but it only lasts a minute.,If they wanted to make an acquisition, that would be the best way in. Let Levi's be what it is, and acquire a company with the street knowledge, the attitude -- not to remake Levi's but to add to it.,Another way is to try and change the culture, like the first wave of designer jeans did 25 years ago. But now, I don't know -- today you'd have to be bigger than Levi's to do that.,BUD KONHEIM -- Owner of the Nicole Miller fashion firm.,The jeans that are selling now have a personality attached to them. So I would invent Henrietta Levi. She would be a young designer who springs out of Tribeca with this cool thing called blue denim.,Look at Helmut Lang. His jeans sell for $130 because everyone is using jeans as a personal sign board. It has nothing to do with whether they are well made or functional. Levi's has lost sight of the fact that cachet sells jeans, not functionality. They need a face.,JOHN BISSELL -- Gunderson Partners, an executive search and management consulting firm in the marketing field.,It's a classic case of what often happens to really well-established, highly recognized brands. Nike has lost some luster lately, and even mighty Coca-Cola is running into problems. Or look at Cadillac.,The message here is that you need to make sure, especially with clothing, that you are always leading the pack. It is dangerous to rely on the brand name to carry you through and let the fashion world march past you.,It's common but not inevitable that a longtime market leader will falter. There are companies that refresh their product very well. Look at Tide, introduced in the 1940's and still the leading detergent. They have gone through 8,000 reformulations, brought in new packaging and new ingredients to stay fresh, and it's kept them ahead of challenger after challenger.,KENNETH HARRIS -- Partner at Cannondale Associates, a consulting firm specializing in consumer packaged-goods marketing.,Levi's has to get back to their core business, great products at a reasonable price, but at the same time move it to the next level, which is mass customization -- ordering jeans made to fit and getting them fast.,They've already started to do this but they have to go much further, possibly with their own stores nationwide. That way they can take control of their own destiny. Levi's have to become ''my jeans'' once again.,And they should never lose sight of the fact that, regardless of what happens domestically, they are blue jeans to the rest of the world. They invented them; they still have cachet. The world is theirs to lose.,BENSON P. SHAPIRO -- Professor of marketing at Harvard Business School and a marketing and sales management consultant.,The people who manage Levi's get older every year, but the kids who buy the stuff do not. In fact, as each new cohort comes along, the age at which kids choose their own clothes has gone down.,Levi's did a great job with the baby boomers. But the baby boomers' kids are in control now. Kids always want something different.,An institutional strategy of bringing in new people is needed: you've got to keep turning it over.,Wisdom ripens with age, like a fine wine. But fashion is like a banana; it rots. Maybe Levi's needs a bit more banana and a bit less wine.,SANFORD C. SIGOLOFF -- Consultant on corporate crisis management and turnarounds and professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.,We talk about life cycles in business, and it seems Levi's is at the very end of the road with some of these problems. Somewhere in the life cycle they fell off the curve, and management didn't catch it.,Levi's were after-hours casual but never moved to office-hours casual. The Gap got that part of the market, while Levi's became a producer for a market segment that remembered wearing Levi's to school but not to the office. The memory market is aging, and Levi's is being shut out of the youth market.,It's pretty hard to recover, and it's clear that management is reaching for pretty catastrophic measures at this point. They are cutting costs, taking losses, moving to offshore manufacturing -- crisis management. They face a long fight back.,Levi's obviously can't get into the designer business. But for a long time they faced no need to innovate. Now they have to come up with new designs that can be hot and find the consumer that will go gaga for them.,And there's a peril in that. They have to balance what they do to cut costs against the need to be able to keep up with demand for the new products that will save them. If they hit on a hot seller and can't deliver the goods, that's worse than anything.,SIMON DOONAN -- Creative director for Barneys New York.,I would get those jeans on people who were more culturally significant.,Maybe it was a mistake to use Marilyn Monroe and Gary Cooper in their ads. We should be thinking more about Lauryn Hill and a hip-hop sensibility because it seems like everyone takes their cue from that.,Hip-hop culture and black culture in general seems to be feeding all aspects of design now. It seems such a potent thing. Maybe Levi's jeans are still too associated with cowboys.,CLIVE CHAJET -- A consultant who advises corporations on brand-building strategies.,The difficulty they have is the natural constraint of not destroying their heritage while trying to be hip and sexy. They somehow have to be a name designer while being timeless. It is very tough.,You do it with advertising in a language and style that is very with-it and fashionable. That means close association with celebrities.,Get Tiger Woods to play golf in Levi's jeans. Make a deal with Porsche that the upholstery fabric on a Porsche model would be Levi Strauss denim. They've got to do out-of-the-box thinking that is really creative, without destroying the heritage.",,"FEB. 28, 1999",BUSINESS; The View From the Outside: Levi's Needs More Than a Patch,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/business-the-view-from-the-outside-levi-s-needs-more-than-a-patch.html
"THE Internal Revenue Service has been  aggressively auditing the tax-exempt status of the more than 20 not-for-profit hospital groups that have struck partnerships with for-profit chains like Columbia/HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare.,At least two deals for such partnerships collapsed recently, clouding the prospects of three hospitals in northern Virginia and four in Alabama. Industry executives say the I.R.S. audits have chilled the outlook for similar joint ventures at a time when many hospitals are under financial pressure. Columbia/HCA and Tenet, the two biggest chains, are already selling dozens of hospitals as they try to bolster profits and investor confidence.,I.R.S. officials made their concerns known in statements at industry meetings and a formal revenue ruling last year that described ''good'' and ''bad'' joint ventures.  Auditors were dispatched to examine foundations and companies that had requested official letters confirming their tax-exempt status. Far from providing these private-letter rulings, the agency placed the requests on hold, pending results of the audits.,Marcus H. Owens, director of the I.R.S. unit policing tax-exempt organizations, said the agency was reluctant to issue the rulings while it was defending the denial of a tax exemption before the United States Tax Court. Redlands Surgical Services, a nonprofit California corporation whose partner is the for-profit Surgical Care Affiliates,  asked the court to overturn the denial.,Critics of the for-profit takeovers, including the Volunteer Trustees Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington, had urged the Government to challenge the tax-exempt status of parties in the joint ventures and to examine the degree to which they were continuing charitable missions, including service for uninsured poor patients.,Bradford H. Gray, director of health and science policy for the New York Academy of Medicine, said that ''by and large, not-for-profit hospitals are not served'' by arrangements that ''blur their distinctiveness as nonprofit organizations.'',Mr. Owens said his agents would try to determine which side controlled a venture's board and whether the exempt entity retained control of day-to-day operations.,For the hospital chains, joint ventures have been an attractive way to deflect initial community opposition to outright takeovers of venerable institutions. Critics say  the chains wait until opposition cools and then gain control, having bought only a half-interest instead of 100 percent.,Nonprofit hospitals, for their part, often lack funds to maintain and improve facilities and have difficulty competing for managed-care contracts. (In New York, state law effectively bars publicly traded corporations from acquiring hospitals.),The largest for-profit chain, Columbia/ HCA, had 22 joint ventures involving the assets of dozens of hospitals. But late last month, Columbia and a partner, the nonprofit Arlington Health Foundation in Virginia, announced that they were breaking up. Both sides blamed the I.R.S. for not acting on the foundation's request for a letter affirming its tax-exempt status.,''Joint ventures can't really fly,'' said Julio Mateo, a lawyer in San Francisco with Consumers Union, an advocacy group. ''The for-profit has to be subordinate to the mission of the nonprofit,'' he said, which conflicts with its ''fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder profits.'',Columbia, which is trying to settle Government charges of Medicare fraud, plans to spin off or sell at least 50 hospitals by late April, keeping 220 to 230 hospitals and its joint venture holdings, said Milton Johnson, its vice president-controller. Tenet, the nation's second-largest for-profit chain, has  told Wall Street analysts that it plans to divest 20 of its 129 hospitals.,Tenet also recently lost a prospective joint venture partner when the nonprofit Eastern Health System in Birmingham, Ala., quietly backed away. David R. Mayeux, executive vice president of Tenet, said that the I.R.S. ruling last year had had ''a chilling effect'' on discussions between Tenet and a number of nonprofits, and that the tax issues did not reflect ''the real world.'' Tenet typically pays off hospital debt and pumps capital into its venture partners, he said, and could not be expected to make such investments without gaining management responsibility.,Both Tenet and Columbia said they expected their remaining joint ventures to pass muster. The courts may have the last word. The I.R.S. rulings about these ventures are ''subject to interpretation and challenge,'' Mr. Mayeux said.",MILT FREUDENHEIM,"FEB. 28, 1999",BUSINESS; Hospitals' Mixed Marriages Raise Eyebrows at the I.R.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/business-hospitals-mixed-marriages-raise-eyebrows-at-the-irs.html

"THE CRISIS READER,Stories, Poetry and Essays From the N.A.A.C.P.'s Crisis Magazine.,Edited by Sondra Kathryn Wilson.,Modern Library, paper, $14.95.,In 1910, one year after the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the organization's director of publicity and research, W. E. B. Du Bois, presented a proposal for a monthly magazine. Thus was born The Crisis, a journal unmatched in its impact on the intellectual life of black America. Guided by Du Bois for the first 24 years of its existence, The Crisis was ''one of the most influential journals on social and political thought ever seen in America,'' as Sondra Kathryn Wilson writes in her introduction to ''The Crisis Reader,'' a generous anthology drawn from the Du Bois years. Dominated in its first decade by Du Bois's impassioned editorials and imperious pronouncements on social policy, The Crisis increasingly became an incubator of black literary talent through the inspired efforts of Jessie Redmon Fauset, the magazine's literary editor from 1919 to 1926; in nurturing talents like Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay and Jean Toomer, Fauset was a principal midwife to the Harlem Renaissance, the explosion of black culture of the 1920's. Wilson, a senior researcher at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute at Harvard, has chosen more widely than deeply, and her own account of the glory years of The Crisis is breathless. However, her selection of poetry, short fiction, drama, personal essays and social criticism includes major figures, from James Weldon Johnson and Alain Locke to E. Franklin Frazier and Walter White. ''The Crisis Reader'' inaugurates the Harlem Renaissance series to be published by the Modern Library; the second volume is ''Infants of the Spring,'' Wallace Thurman's roman  clef, originally published in 1932 and, at best, of historical interest only.

"IMANI ALL MINE,By Connie Porter.,Houghton Mifflin, $23.,Tasha is a good girl, an extremely smart 15-year-old who was not quite smart enough to avoid having her own child, Imani, whose name, Tasha has been told, means faith in an African language. In Tasha's life, though, faith is not enough. Connie Porter's beautifully realized novel, ''Imani All Mine,'' told in Tasha's voice, is the story of great promise shining through monstrous obstacles: an ignorant mother, an absent father, teachers who don't want her to succeed, a Buffalo neighborhood crippled by drugs and crime, her own poor self-image (''I was a pig and somebody God ain't even care about''). The devastation of that promise is expertly depicted by Porter, author of the critically praised 1991 novel ''All-Bright Court'' and the ''Addy'' books in the American Girl series. Like many teen-agers, Tasha avidly consults Seventeen magazine, which is sadly inappropriate to her life. There are no back-to-school wardrobes for her, let alone prom dresses. She learns to blame herself for almost everything: ''How stupid I was that night. . . . Thinking he really liked me. As fat as I am. As black as I am. As much as my body look like it ain't never supposed to be loved by no boy.'' This captivating novel falters only near the end, when it becomes sentimental and repetitious.

"EARLIER this month, when a panel of novelists, critics and scholars resided over a kind of town meeting at Columbia University on the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, it turned out to be the last such event; a week later, the President was acquitted. The rallies, petitions and public protests of recent months have been striking if only to remind us how seldom the cultural elite have played a public role in a political debate in recent years. The contrast was driven home to me recently when I picked up ''Reporting Vietnam,'' the Library of America's collection of essays and reportage from 1959 to 1975. In addition to superb war dispatches, the anthology includes the work of such writers as Norman Mailer and Mary McCarthy, who added to the antiwar drumbeat at home in public protests and in essays for Harper's Magazine and The Nation.,In hindsight, these volumes read like the winning side of an argument: it seems clearer than ever that the Vietnam War should not have been fought, since it could not have been won. But what of the opposing view? All but missing in the volumes is the odd assortment of writers who supported the White House at a time when most intellectuals were mounting the antiwar battlements. Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike, Ralph Ellison, James T. Farrell, John Steinbeck and John Dos Passos, among others, supported American intervention in Vietnam, some of them until the bitter end.,I encountered some of these names in the early 1990's while researching a book about Dean Acheson; they appeared in pamphlets connected to one of the nongovernmental '' 'citizens' committees'' set up to promote the Johnson Administration's Vietnam policy. Perhaps the most surprising was that of Ellison, whose 1952 novel, ''Invisible Man,'' had made him a figure of moral authority on the left. According to Charles Tyroler, a Democratic strategist who recruited prominent writers to sign pro-war manifestoes at Johnson's behest, Ellison agreed to help the Administration in 1967. ''He told me about his own merchant marine service and how disgraceful he thought it was for peaceniks and draft dodgers to denounce our boys in 'Nam,'' Tyroler said in an interview. ''And he thought it was disastrous for the civil rights movement to hitch its future on the antiwar diatribes of H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael.'',Ellison wasn't alone among African-American intellectuals. His closest literary friend, Albert Murray, told me: ''We were disillusioned with Martin Luther King Jr. for getting recruited to denounce the Vietnam War. Ellison was loyal to L.B.J., working with him to promote the humanities and to pass civil rights laws.'' Ellison was so enamored of President Johnson that he wrote an essay about him called ''The Myth of the Flawed White Southerner.'' With equal admiration Murray, in his novel ''South to a Very Old Place,'' portrayed L.B.J. as a messiah figure; Jack Valenti, Johnson's special assistant, later wrote to Murray that the President would read passages from the novel out loud just to savor the voice of an African-American intellectual who was on his side.,Far less surprising than Ellison's stance was that of John Dos Passos. Though he had once voted for the Communist ticket, in 1932, the 68-year-old novelist endorsed Barry Goldwater in 1964 and regularly lambasted the New Left for the ''stale dogmas of discredited Marxism.'' Still, even Dos Passos' close friends -- particularly Edmund Wilson -- were dismayed by his denunciations of Robert F. Kennedy's ethics and Robert Lowell's dovishness. ''Even to speak of pacifism in the United States today is the equivalent of a mea culpa,'' he declared in a 1967 interview.,Some of Dos Passos' pro-war sentiment can be ascribed to his unwillingness to distinguish America's motives in Vietnam from the grander goals of World War II. The same can be said of another writer of his generation, the author of the Studs Lonigan trilogy, James T. Farrell. Like Dos Passos, Farrell had been seduced by Marxism in his youth but had grown to despise Communist ideology. He was ''deeply disturbed that college students were siding with Hanoi instead of the White House,'' Tyroler recalled. As the debate intensified over Vietnam, Farrell considered it his duty to alert the public to the insidious nature of ''Peking-sponsored totalitarianism masquerading as Communism.'',Other literary figures also backed the United States' military involvement in Vietnam but waged more private battles. Vladimir Nabokov ''thought of Vietnam almost entirely in light of the crushing of freedom'' that Soviet influence might bring, according to his biographer, Brian Boyd. He even sent Johnson a telegram after his gallbladder operation, wishing him a ''speedy return to the admirable work you are accomplishing'' in containing Communist expansion and promoting civil rights. Among the younger generation, John Updike found himself ''out of step'' with his editorial colleagues at The New Yorker as well as with his literary friends on Martha's Vineyard, who were ''almost universally 'antiwar.' '' In the chapter ''On Not Being a Dove'' in his memoir ''Self-Consciousness,'' Updike recounts in painful detail his rationale for embracing L.B.J.'s military blunders. ''I do not believe that the Vietcong and Ho Chi Minh have a moral edge over us,'' he had written in 1966, ''nor do I believe that great powers can always avoid using their power. I am for our intervention if it does some good -- specifically, if it enables the people of South Vietnam to seek their own political future.'',More than any other American cultural figure, however, it was John Steinbeck who bolstered Johnson's morale on Vietnam. A friend of L.B.J. since the Depression, Steinbeck strongly supported the G.I.'s, particularly as his son was among them; to him, they were heroes like the Dust Bowl Okies he celebrated in ''The Grapes of Wrath.'' The author -- who for six weeks in the winter of 1966-67 covered the war for Newsday -- was incensed that overprivileged college radicals were becoming media darlings while ''good kids'' like his son were fighting in Indochina.,The 60's counterculture already had little use for Steinbeck's unabashed patriotism, and when newspapers ran photographs of him glaring beneath a helmet over the barrel of a gun, the antiwar left unfairly branded him a militaristic stooge of the Government. Peter Collier, writing in Ramparts, compared Steinbeck's nativist support for the soldiers to Ezra Pound's ''aid and comfort'' to the Italian Fascists during World War II.,If the antiwar activists were disappointed in Steinbeck and Ellison, they were utterly bewildered by a more contemporary icon: the apolitical and prototypically hip Jack Kerouac, who refused to embrace the peace movement, though actually he had changed his views little since 1942, when he joined the merchant marine carrying a duffel bag full of novels. At the University of Naples in 1966 he stoutly defended Vietnam policy in front of a shocked audience of Italian students who had come to hear a Beat dissident. When radical protesters broke up the event, ''I snuck out like a football player,'' he recalled, ''and ran to our sports car. Zoom!'',For a time the Johnson Administration sought to mobilize its supporters behind a kind of pro-war PR campaign. Thus in late 1965, while a frizzy-haired Allen Ginsberg went about chanting ''Capitalists proffer Napalm and money in green suitcases to the Naked,'' Dos Passos, Farrell and about 50 others joined the Administration's Committee for an Effective and Durable Peace in Asia. One manifesto urged like-minded Americans to ''shout'' their approval of American policy in Vietnam so that it ''will ring as loudly in Peking as in Peoria.'' By 1967 two organizations were working to consolidate support for the war: the White House Information Group, designed to cultivate favorable news coverage, and the Citizens Committee for Peace With Freedom in Vietnam, which claimed to speak for the ''silent center'' of pro-war opinion.,Ultimately, however, the very composition of these committees -- most of whose members were over 60 -- unwittingly underlined how Vietnam was dividing America along generational lines. And as the war went on, something -- perhaps the growing evidence that South Vietnam was not the ally it had appeared to be, or that, to paraphrase a famous remark of an Army major, we seemed to be destroying the country in order to save it -- kept many of the Administration's celebrity supporters from taking a more public stand. As Updike wrote in a letter to The New York Times in 1967, he felt, like W. H. Auden, that ''it is foolish to canvass writers upon political issues. Not only do our views, as he says, 'have no more authority that those of any reasonably well-educated citizen,' but in my own case at least I feel my professional need for freedom of speech and expression prejudices me toward a government whose constitution guarantees it.'',By 1968 the ''silent center'' had become Richard Nixon's ''silent majority,'' and L.B.J.'s citizens' committees were shut down. The war abroad and at home, of course, ground on until the last troops left Vietnam.",DOUGLAS BRINKLEY,"FEB. 28, 1999",BOOKEND; The Other Vietnam Generation,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/bookend-the-other-vietnam-generation.html
"The City of Sails is what Aucklanders call their metropolis, and it is much more than a marketing slogan cooked up by an identity-hungry chamber of commerce.,Stand on the deck of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, the club that will be host to the 1999-2000 America's Cup regatta starting in October, and you can see nearly 2,000 boats moored in Westhaven Harbor. There are several hundred more nearby in Bay's Water, where a local boy named Peter Blake learned to sail in a dinghy long before he became a knight and a national role model. There are several hundred more in Half Moon Bay, in Gulf Harbor, and thousands more scattered among the myriad inlets and even the backyards of New Zealand's largest city.,''The water is easy to get to here, and though boating is not cheap, it is not considered to be elitist,'' said John Cutler, a New Zealander who is sailing director for America True, the challenger syndicate from the San Francisco Yacht Club.,In all, there are an estimated 80,000 vessels in Auckland, one for every 11 inhabitants. A year from now, when Team New Zealand defends the America's Cup it won so convincingly in 1995 in San Diego, enough of those vessels will be in the Hauraki Gulf to form a spectator fleet that would dwarf most navies.,''They got 650 boats in San Diego, and we're looking at peaking at five to six thousand,'' said Tony Thomas, the America's Cup event director. ''Can you imagine the atmosphere with a kind of diamond surrounded by boats and inside that diamond are two America's Cup yachts having a battle. It will be like a stadium, a very full stadium.'',It will be the rough equivalent to staging an Alpine ski race in Austria, or a football game in Dallas. And at least for the moment in Auckland, souvenirs for the country's most prominent sports team, Rugby Union's All Blacks, have been pushed out of the display windows by paraphernalia hawking and hailing the merits of Team New Zealand.,''In San Diego, there were a few people who knew about the America's Cup and were excited about it, but the majority didn't care,'' Cutler said. ''But down here, this is a substantial event.'',Yet, there's more to America's Cup than its popularity among sailors. The event always provides a backdrop of intrigue and clandestine activity on the technology front. In Auckland, it could prove even more difficult to keep, say, a new keel under wraps because the syndicates will be working in particularly close quarters when the challenger series, known as the Louis Vuitton Cup, begins on Oct. 18. Unlike in San Diego, all the yachts and their crews and support staff are expected to be based in the same location: the Viaduct Basin which has been transformed at the considerable cost of $45 million (U.S.) from a relatively shallow fishing basin into a world-class harbor.,When New Zealand won in 1995, Blake, the veteran sailor in charge of the successful campaign, knew he wanted five years -- instead of the customary three or four it usually takes to mount a defense -- to give Auckland time to prepare. Blake also wanted to capitalize on the year 2000 hoopla and the synergy generated by the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in the same year.,Not everyone has shared Blake's buoyant vision, however. For one thing, the long gap between cup competitions has not made fund-raising easy for the challengers. And though Auckland has a rich sailing culture, it lacked the sort of deep-water slips that America's Cup yachts require.,Now, that problem has been rectified, although several of the syndicates are disgruntled that the rental fee for an empty lot in the America's Cup harbor complex exceeds $200,000 (U.S.) for the duration of their stay. Cutler estimates that construction costs will bring the total price to well above $500,000 (U.S.).,For the moment, 15 syndicates, 5 of them American, have made official challenges for the cup, although Blake expects no more than 12 to be on the starting line in October. Prada, the well-financed and well-organized Italian syndicate, has constructed its boat shed and headquarters. So has America One, whose skipper, Paul Cayard, won the prestigious Whitbread Round the World Race last year in his first attempt but remains most passionate about America's Cup.,Team New Zealand's headquarters, an imposing structure made of corrugated steel and painted black, has been operational since late last year, and to get past the front door, one must put a thumb on a high-tech scanner and hope the fingerprint matches the one on file.,Security will, as always in this event, be intense. In early February, Chris Main, an Aucklander working for the Japanese syndicate Nippon Challenge, accused a Team New Zealand support boat of ramming his inflatable craft as he observed the Kiwis train from a distance. The New Zealanders maintained that Main had been violating the rules, which stipulate that competitors must stay 200 meters away from each other's yachts.,On a less bellicose note, unidentified pranksters made their way into America True's compound one night in February and taped a huge red silhouette of Godzilla, complete with small airplanes and falling bodies, on the side of the syndicate's training boat, which used to feature only a logo of the Golden Gate Bridge.,Many of the challengers, including Young America, the New York Yacht Club entry, have been training here with practice boats during the Southern Hemisphere's summer in an attempt to acclimatize themselves to the conditions they will face in the race. This being Auckland, those conditions will be highly variable, and though the wind is generally 10 knots stronger in October than it is in late February and early March, when the final races will be contested, there are no guarantees.,''I think anybody who is building a one-sided boat for this course is not looking at the data,'' said Bob Billingham, chief operating officer for America One.,The course is framed on three sides by land, including several islands that will prove telegenic. Because of the surrounding land, ocean swells -- which sailors had to deal with off Fremantle, Australia, in 1987 and off San Diego -- will not be a factor. ''This a natural amphitheater,'' Thomas said.,Billingham and other challengers know that it will be extremely difficult to wrest the cup from Blake and Team New Zealand in their home waters. The Kiwis will not conduct the traditional defender's trials, preferring instead to unify their efforts and their sponsorship and to refine their two boats until a challenger emerges from what should be a particularly grueling process if 12 syndicates are involved.,''The single biggest advantage the challengers have is that we will be racing against each other for four and a half months,'' Billingham said. ''The New Zealanders don't have anybody to race but their own team, which isn't necessarily bad considering that their second-string crew and boat are probably way better than 90 percent of everybody else.'',It is a calculated risk by Blake, and the man who helped spark a national celebration in 1995 and was knighted for his efforts is well aware that sporting popularity can prove as ephemeral as a yacht's wake.,''Our team doesn't want to have to go live in Rio de Janeiro forever, and neither do I,'' Blake said, a thin smile forming under his thick mustache.",CHRISTOPHER CLAREY,"FEB. 28, 1999",THE BOATING REPORT; Auckland Is Eager for America's Cup,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/the-boating-report-auckland-is-eager-for-america-s-cup.html

"APPALACHIA,By Charles Wright.,67 pp. New York:,Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $20.,IN Charles Wright's long career as a poet he has returned again and again to a few themes and subjects -- the Appalachia where he grew up and the Italy where he has lived, personal and family history, favorite writers and painters. But the still center around which these themes whirl has always been Wright's metaphysical yearning, his desire for a mystical or religious transcendence that is seemingly impossible today. In ''Appalachia,'' Wright's 13th volume, that desire is more in evidence than ever. Despite the book's title, there is less here about Wright's native ground than in his previous work. The focus, rather, is on ''God . . . the fire my feet are held to''; on the torment of wanting to believe and finding nothing that can secure belief.,The transcendence that Wright courts, and can never win, is left necessarily vague. His spiritual feeling is not Christian, though it is informed by Christianity, as well as by Eastern and Platonic ideas. It asks not for proof of any particular doctrine, but rather for a pre-theological affirmation that there is wholeness, beauty and meaning in the world and in our lives -- ''that pure grace / which is invisible and sure and clear.'' In search of such grace, Wright interrogates the heavens:,The night sky is an ideogram,,a code card punched with holes.,It thinks it's the word of what's-to-come.,It thinks this, but it's only The Library of Last Resort,,The reflected light of The Great Misunderstanding.,And the earth:,Roses and rhododendron wax glint,Through dogwood and locust leaves,,Flesh-colored, flesh-destined, spring in false flower . . .,We haven't a clue as to what counts,In the secret landscape behind the landscape we look at here.,But, as the lines acknowledge, what he is looking for lies in neither of these; grace is not in nature but beyond or behind it. And so it can only be described in symbols, of which light, for Wright as for Dante, is the most important:,All my life I've looked for this slow light, this smallish light,Starting to seep, coppery blue,,out of the upper right-hand corner of things, Down through the trees and off the back yard . . .,Until the clouds stop, and hush . . .,Until there is nothing else.,This fulfillment, however, remains always in the future tense, something to be wished for or despaired of, but never actually present. And so Wright's poetry is dialectical, asking and answering its own question, swaying back and forth between the moment of hope and the moment of realism:,The sacred is frightening to the astral body,,As is its absence.,We have to choose which fear is our consolation.,Or, again:,We live in two landscapes, as Augustine might have said,,One that's eternal and divine,,and one that's just the back yard,,Dead leaves and dead grass in November, purple in spring.,Wright's poems, in their passionate hesitation, seem to be bowing down not to God but to the place where God used to be: a form of post-Nietzschean piety.,As might be expected, a spirit caught in this cul-de-sac, capable of neither true belief nor final resignation to unbelief, is a troubled one. Over the years, Wright has evolved a style that can communicate such a turbulent consciousness: the poems in ''Appalachia'' move in quick, jagged jumps, beginning with a dashed-off description or casual observation and then vaulting into the most elevated thoughts. His free-verse lines are loaded with compound words and heavy consonants, sometimes alliterative in the manner of Gerard Manley Hopkins, sometimes incantatory and repetitive like Sylvia Plath. And frequently those lines break into two shorter halves, as if to show us a caesura in the stream of consciousness.,Yet for all the agitation in Wright's style and mood, the poems in ''Appalachia'' have very little forward motion. Each of them returns to the same problem, the same dilemma, and comes away with the same frustration: Wright is ''waiting for something to come -- anything,'' but it never does. And while this monotony is not a defect, a sign of the poet's lack of skill, it is nonetheless a limitation.,IT is a limitation that stems, ultimately, from Wright's very conception of what poetry should do. For Wright's spiritual dilemma itself -- being trapped between the attractiveness of belief and its impossibility -- is not a new one; we find much the same situation in Matthew Arnold, more than a century ago. The difference between them is that Arnold refused the completeness of spiritual conviction, but embraced the completeness of poetic form -- the regularity and pattern that can make even the expression of doubt a confident, beautiful whole. Wright, like many serious poets today, refuses both kinds of completeness. He wants poetry to represent consciousness, to mirror the motions of the mind; and in this task, poetic form is not required, nor is extended, consecutive argument. These poems do not want to be made things, beautiful in their wholeness. They are, rather, faithfully incomplete, like the mind itself.,It is this refusal -- the willingness to live without so much, both spiritually and poetically -- that condemns the poems in ''Appalachia'' to turn continually upon themselves, allowing them neither sort of consummation. Yet it is also a product of Wright's particular integrity, and what makes his poetry such a significant and true reflection of our time.",ADAM KIRSCH,"FEB. 28, 1999",Between Heaven and Earth,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/between-heaven-and-earth.html

"There were tears in Joe Girardi's eyes, and he did not try to wipe them away. His brown eyes were red because he was talking about losing his mother, losing his baby and finally, hopefully, having a new baby. The emotions were unusually close to the surface.,As Girardi discussed what he, his wife, Kim, and his family have endured -- and what they expect to eventually enjoy -- he spoke softly and evenly. He believes in hope. God, he said, has a plan for everyone, and life's travails will somehow be handled. At least that is what Girardi wants to believe. Sometimes, it has been complicated.,He remembers being in the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee after the Yankees played the Brewers in April 1997 and trying to reach Kim on the telephone. It was late and there was no answer. Where was his pregnant wife? Girardi felt helpless and frightened. The minutes passed like hours before he received a call telling him about Kim's miscarriage 10 weeks into her pregnancy.,''That was one of the toughest things we've ever had to go through,'' Girardi said. ''We thought that God had timed it perfectly. The baby was going to be born in November, so we'd have the whole off season to be with the baby. I kept calling her that night and she wasn't answering. I knew something was wrong.'',The 34-year-old catcher, seated in a folding chair in the clubhouse at Legends Field one day last week, stared straight ahead. Girardi is cautiously elated about becoming a father later this year, but losing a baby is never forgotten, and he seemed to be reflecting on the loss while he talked.,For a year after the miscarriage, Girardi consoled Kim. But nothing he said fully soothed her. They are a deeply religious couple and so close that Girardi once brought Kim to the podium during a news conference at Yankee Stadium to announce a contract extension, draped his arm around her and never let her return to her seat.,But the months after the miscarriage were distressing and reminded Girardi of how he felt when his mother, Angela, died of ovarian cancer 15 years ago. The final words she said before dying were directed to Girardi, who was 19 at the time. ''Don't forget me,'' she said. He felt grief then and grief after the miscarriage.,Kim, who is 33, felt it more.,''She started to blame herself,'' Girardi said. ''She took it a lot harder than I did. We went through a tough period until like a year later. It was much tougher for her because it was part of her. I just told her it wasn't her fault. It was God's will.'',Girardi's voice never wavered. Girardi, who has contributed mightily to two World Series championships in three years in New York since a trade from Colorado, is one of the leaders of the team's chapel group, and became committed to his faith through his wife, whom he met while both were attending Northwestern University. Still, Girardi wondered why she had to suffer.,''I thought, 'Why her?' '' Girardi said. ''I don't think 'Why me?' too much. Maybe that's because I saw what my mom went through and never saw her slack off in what she wanted to do. Very seldom will I say, 'Why me?' I kept saying: 'Why her, God? Let her have a baby.' '',Girardi proudly revealed Kim's pregnancy last week while talking about his passion for children. The convivial Girardi has befriended a 14-year-old named Ray Smith, a dauntless teen-ager who has undergone three open-heart surgeries, adores the Yankees and is the only kid in Mount Marion, N.Y., who has Girardi's telephone number and address.,''Let's put it this way: he's my best friend,'' Smith said.,The subject of Girardi's hopes for a family came up while he was talking about his friendship with Smith and was asked why someone who loves children as he does has not had any himself.,Girardi explained that he and Kim have tried to have a child since 1996, only to have had the miscarriage jolt them. According to the Georgetown University Medical Center, studies have shown that about 31 percent of pregnancies may end in miscarriage. Girardi had begun to doubt that he would ever have children.,''I had set in my mind, kind of, that we might never get there,'' Girardi said.,Now that Kim is three months pregnant and doctors have said she is fine, Girardi feels comfortable telling people about the pregnancy. Kim, who has asthma and allergies, was bedridden for three days at the outset of the pregnancy, but Girardi said she has been fine since then -- other than dealing with her protective husband.,''He won't let me do anything,'' Kim has said.,For the last three months, Girardi has cooked, cleaned, walked the dogs, done the laundry and persuaded Kim to go slow. That is not easy for a woman who loves to exercise and has plans to pursue a doctorate in psychology.,''I told her to rest,'' Girardi said. ''Nothing else.'',Girardi chuckled at the thought of his wife as a couch potato, and the tautness in his face vanished. The Yankees are scheduled to be playing in Anaheim, Calif., on the due date, so the Girardis might ask doctors to induce labor before the team leaves for the West Coast. Girardi said they will name the baby after Kim's grandfather, Sereno. If it is a girl, the name will be altered to Serena.,Girardi said he thinks he will be a good father, because he has his mother's sensitivity and his father's devotion. His mother once attended all 60 amateur games he played in one season, and his father, Jerry, used to drive the six-hour round trip to take him to Cubs games. Girardi, who played for the Cubs from 1989 to '92, looks forward to being a devoted parent, too.,''What's helped us through that is we've seen so many instances in our life where God had a better plan for us than we ever had,'' he said. ''I think the most glaring thing is when I was traded to New York, and I'm reminded of it every day. It's much easier to say that, now that she's pregnant, but it was hard when she wasn't pregnant because you're trying to figure out why. You have to realize there's a plan.''",JACK CURRY,"FEB. 28, 1999","BASEBALL; Throughout Life's Many Travails, the Yankees' Girardi Is Keeping the Faith",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/baseball-throughout-life-s-many-travails-yankees-girardi-keeping-faith.html
"Strawberry skipped most of the Yankee workout today, saying he felt awful after undergoing chemotherapy. Manager Joe Torre reiterated there is no pressure on Strawberry to participate, and his first priority is for the outfielder to ''get better'' and recover from colon cancer. ''I told him, 'Whenever you're ready to play, come tell us,' '' Torre said.,Strawberry hoped he would feel well to participate, the first time he has tried to work out the day after chemotherapy. But he felt ill when he woke up and did not eat breakfast. After stretching under a hot sun at 10 A.M., Strawberry returned to the clubhouse.,''When you take chemo, it's hard on your body,'' said Strawberry, who will have his next chemotherapy on March 12. ''I didn't know how my body would react.'',''We'll let Darryl do what he wants to do,'' said George Steinbrenner, the principal owner who came out to watch batting practice for the first time this spring, said.,Steinbrenner, who refused to comment on the Yankees' recent merger with the Nets, said it is natural to worry about how a team performs the year after winning a championship. Guarding against complacency, he said, ''is up to the manager and the coaching staff. I don't think you have to convince these players -- I just think you've got guys who really have a good chemistry.'',The Yankees lost twice in arbitration this month, decisions awarding $5 million to shortstop Derek Jeter and $4.25 million to Mariano Rivera. Steinbrenner was upset with the decisions.,''I don't understand either arbitration case; I really don't,'' Steinbrenner said. ''I do not understand the decision, and the lawyers that I talked to do not understand it.''",BUSTER OLNEY,"FEB. 28, 1999",BASEBALL; Strawberry Is Made Sick By a Reaction to Therapy,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/baseball-strawberry-is-made-sick-by-a-reaction-to-therapy.html
"Mariano Rivera hits targets instinctively. This is the easy part of what he does. As a boy, he used to whip rocks at cardboard or hurl tightly wound string at tiny inner tubes on the beaches of Panama. As a man, he aims baseballs at a catcher's mitt and almost never misses. All the same, really.,What has changed, and allowed the Yankees' Rivera to become perhaps the most dominant relief pitcher in the American League, is his subtle mastery of a baseball's movement. Rivera's fastball -- typically in the range of 93 to 96 miles an hour -- used to be as straight as Park Avenue; now it possesses more turns and bends than the Taconic.,''He's more mature as a pitcher,'' said Joe Girardi, one of the Yankees' catchers. ''He understands more about how to close, about that mentality.'',Rivera reached into his locker here the other day and pulled out a baseball. How, he was asked, are you making the ball move so much? How do you make the ball veer into the hands of left-handed batters, or dive at right-handed batters?,Leaning forward in his chair, Rivera held the baseball nearly at arm's length; enveloped in his fingers, it looked like a stunted tangerine. ''It depends on how you grip the baseball,'' said Rivera, two fingers and a thumb tucked underneath the ball, his right index and middle fingers extended over the top, slightly bent, flexing. ''You can get it to cut more if you do this. . . .'',His fingers didn't appear to move. He apparently had changed the pressure applied by his fingertips. ''Or you do this, to get more movement.'',Rivera struggled to explain, but then, Hendrix might've had trouble accounting for the sounds that emerged from his guitar.,This is Rivera 101, through the eyes of his catchers: When he first emerged in the major leagues, in 1995 and '96, his primary pitch was a sailing four-seam fastball that he usually threw high in the strike zone. Rivera would throw a 96-mile-an-hour fastball thigh high for a strike, and then he would throw the next belly-button high, and the next chest high, and they would keep swinging, and mostly missing. In 1996, when Rivera served as the setup man for John Wetteland, he struck out 130 batters in 107 2/3 innings.,But major league hitters are adaptable. ''They started making adjustments on him, once they had seen him,'' Girardi said. ''They didn't always swing at that high ball.'',Rivera realized, too, that all those strikeouts would take their toll on him, eventually. And, in fact, some American League scouts felt he tired at the end of the 1997 season. Rivera wanted to become more efficient, to pitch in the bottom half of the strike zone and generate more ground balls, rather than strikeouts.,Rivera found that, with the right grip, he could throw what is known as a cut fastball. When throw by a right-handed pitcher, a cutter veers toward a left-handed batter. Because Rivera throws his so hard, however, the movement is explosive, very late and very sharp. ''It's just nasty,'' said Jorge Posada, the Yankees' starting catcher.,A left-handed slugger like Mo Vaughn will start swinging at a fastball that appears to be over the heart of the plate, and by the time he whips around his bat, Rivera's cutter will have turned and jammed Vaughn.,Last year, left-handed batters had 115 at-bats against Rivera and hit exactly zero home runs and accounted for just nine strikeouts.,Mike Stanton, the Yankees reliever, believes Rivera's cut fastball to be something of a freak of nature, because Rivera releases his cutter in almost the same way a quarterback throws a football -- the fingers held to the side of the ball, rather than over the top, as almost all fastballs are thrown.,When facing right-handed batters, Rivera sometimes use a two-seam fastball. When thrown by a right-handed pitcher, it will veer back into a right-handed batter.,''He has become someone who really likes to pitch inside,'' Posada said.,Inside, and down. Girardi said that in 1995 and 1996, he would set a high target with his mitt, and Rivera would throw high fastballs. Now the Yankees catchers set low targets, in the bottom half of the strike zone, often just underneath the hands of both left-handed and right-handed batters.,Rivera struck out 36 batters in 61 1/3 innings in 1998, and there was much speculation that Rivera had lost his fastball, that he was in jeopardy of losing his stuff. To the contrary: Rivera had simply become more efficient, as he wanted, and evolved from a strikeout pitcher into a ground-ball pitcher. In 1995, he averaged 0.65 groundballs for every fly ball and needed an average of 18.7 pitches to get through each inning. In 1998, he had 1.6 ground balls to every fly ball and needed 14.9 pitches per inning.,The efficiency, and Manager Joe Torre's conservative rationing of Rivera through the summer, paid off in October. ''He cut down on his pitches, and that was important in the long run, over a full season,'' Girardi said. ''He was really strong in the playoffs this year.'',Preparing for last year's playoffs, an American League advance scout trailing the Yankees said that Rivera ''is the best closer in baseball right now, and there's really nobody close to him.'' In one scouting assessment, it was noted that 93 percent of the pitches he threw were fastballs but very different fastballs, cutters and four-seamers and two-seamers.,Rivera didn't surrender any runs in 13 1/3 innings in the playoffs and World Series, and with the finish line in sight, he overpowered opposing hitters once more, striking out 11 and allowing six hits. Trevor Hoffman, San Diego's hard-throwing closer, appeared in 12 more games than Rivera during the regular season, threw more pitches and had more strikeouts and his fastball was clocked at a mediocre 88 miles an hour in Game 3 of the World Series, when he allowed Scott Brosius's decisive three-run home run. Rivera, on the other hand, was throwing 95-97 miles an hour.,''He was just unbelievable,'' San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy said, after the Yankees swept the Padres in the World Series.,Part of Rivera's daily regimen now is to sign dozens of pictures and magazine covers that bear the image of his arms outstretched, his face possessed by joy and by Girardi's bear hug in the first moment after the Yankees clinched last year's World Series.,It is an expression that comes easily to Rivera. He loves his life. Rivera is always the same, his teammate Derek Jeter said. Easygoing, gracious, quick to offer a pat on the shoulder as he passes, constantly smiling. Jeter would go to the mound before the most crucial innings last season and say to Rivera, ''Let's go, let's get it done now,'' and there was never any doubt Rivera would succeed. There was always the sense that on the mound, Rivera could barely contain his grin, that he was absolutely sure he would prevail and that like a little kid, he was having the best time.,Tension? Nervousness? Please.,''He has a lot of fun out there,'' Girardi said.,Rivera believes his own demeanor closely resembles that of his father's, also named Mariano. ''He thinks you should be responsible, and that you should respect other people,'' Rivera said, ''and that you should enjoy your life.'',His father is a fisherman who now captains a boat; when Rivera was growing up, his father was part of a crew that would go out for nets full of sardines, a week at a time. But even in his father's absence, Rivera was surrounded by family, cousins and his mother. If he did something wrong, his relatives or his teachers punished him immediately, and he waited mournfully for his father to come home for more punishment. ''He would give me a whipping,'' Rivera said. ''It's so different here. I see little kids be disrespectful to each other, or to their parents, and I cannot believe it.'',Rivera and his friends played soccer or football, or baseball, though they almost never had baseballs. They would cut three grapefruit-sized holes in a strip of cardboard, and hang this from two stakes jammed into the sands of a nearby beach. They would have contests on who could throw a rock or whatever object they had through a particular hole. When Rivera was a teen-ager, he started joining his father on the boats, and could not believe how hard the work was.,''It just wasn't the life I wanted,'' he said.,He was thrilled to sign with the Yankees at age 20, became stronger and started throwing harder, and realized immediately how much he liked what he was doing.,Last year, the national rotation of reporters would ask Rivera two or three times a week about the game-tying home run Sandy Alomar hit against him when the Yankees were four outs away from winning the division series in 1997, about the home run's impact on Rivera's psyche.,The volume of these questions increased dramatically once the playoffs began, and Rivera always patiently and respectfully answered. But it was apparent, if you happened to eavesdrop repeatedly on these conversations, that Alomar's home run did not haunt Rivera at all, that he truly believed the blow to be a one-time phenomenon, and if not for the endless inquiries, he would have all but forgotten about it.,''I could throw the same pitch in the same spot,'' Rivera said, shrugging, ''and he probably couldn't hit it the same way again. I supplied the power for that. He just put the bat on the ball.,''I felt bad at the time. But, when it was over, what could I do about it? It was already behind me. What's the sense in worrying about it? What good does that do you? Why get upset? Just enjoy yourself. When you have doubts, you're done, you're history, you're finished.'',Rivera saved 43 games in 52 attempts in 1997 and 36 in 41 chances in '98; he has become better each year, better and more efficient.,''I want to work on my sinker this year,'' Rivera said. ''You will see more sinkers, and I think the ground balls will go up.'',Throwing strikes is easy. But making the ball move, that's what Rivera is all about now.",BUSTER OLNEY,"FEB. 28, 1999",BASEBALL; Rivera Now Delivers A More Subtle Sting,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/baseball-rivera-now-delivers-a-more-subtle-sting.html
"Scene I: Team executives meet with prospective manager in Dominican Republic hotel, virtually concluding agreement except for signature.,Scene II: Prospective manager flies home to Florida. Team executives follow on flight two hours later, unable to join prospective manager and perhaps get his signature because his flight has no more seats available.,Scene III: Team executives arrive at home of prospective manager, only to find representatives of his current employer there making an offer they hope he can't refuse.,Scene IV: Prospective manager accepts offer from current employer, relegating himself to more losing seasons with impoverished team and passing up opportunity to lead nouveau riche team to the World Series.,Thus it was that Felipe Alou remained the manager of the Montreal Expos instead of managing the Los Angeles Dodgers.,''The only thing I didn't do was fly to Los Angeles,'' Alou said, recounting his October experience. ''I was practically gone from the Expos. When the Dodgers got permission to talk to me, they flew to Santo Domingo and I met with them the first night they arrived there at the hotel. We really had more or less an agreement right away. There were a few small details left.'',These scenes played out after Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' new general manager, requested and received permission to speak with Alou, with whom he had worked in Montreal.,''Our families have been close,'' Malone said. ''His wife and my wife have been very good friends ever since '94. It was a peculiar situation. Because of our relationship, I wanted to do what was best for him. We felt pretty much an agreement was in place. But the Expos made it difficult for him to leave.'',If the Expos did not want their remarkably talented manager to leave, why did they give the Dodgers permission to talk to him in the first place?,''We wanted to make him feel comfortable, whether that was signing him to an extension or talking to other clubs,'' Jim Beattie, the Expos' general manager, said. ''He said if other clubs called, he'd like to talk to them. The Dodgers called, we asked him and he said he wanted to talk to them.'',Alou, at 63 the second-oldest manager in the major leagues, had managed the Expos for seven seasons, a tenure that was preceded by 12 years as a manager in their minor league system, including seven years at the Class A level. He had built a reputation for being able to overcome a steady exodus of his best players and still field a competitive team made up of youngsters who responded to his leadership. If not for the players' strike in 1994, he might have taken the team to a division championship.,The Expos last year had an $8.3 million payroll, the lowest in the majors, and did not plan to remove the decimal point and have that much larger number as their 1999 payroll. The Dodgers, on the other hand, will pay their players an amount in that neighborhood.,''Oh yeah, we could do some things,'' Alou said, his eyes lighting up at the thought of what might have been had he gone to the Dodgers. ''They told me they were going to go out and get some of the best players and they are doing that. It was an incredibly good-looking situation for me to go to.'',While Alou was talking to Malone and Bob Graziano, the Dodgers' president, his wife, Lucie, called to tell him that the Expos would like a chance to meet with him before he signed with the Dodgers.,''I flew back to Florida and the Dodgers flew to Florida but not on the same flight,'' Alou related, sitting in his spring training office. ''That made a difference. My flight left at 8; theirs left at 10.'' If they had gone at 8? ''You'd be talking to me somewhere else. But there was no room on that flight.'',When Alou arrived home, Beattie and an Expos minority partner, Mark Routtenberg, were arriving to meet with him. ''They told me they wanted me to stay,'' Alou said.,Re-enter Malone and Graziano. ''They arrived about 1 o'clock in the afternoon and they came to my house and the Expos were inside the house,'' Alou said. ''That really was a tough call for me.'',Alou said his wife took Malone and Graziano to a nearby restaurant for lunch. Malone recalled that Lucie Alou was having lunch at a restaurant next door to where he and Graziano went. However the scene played out, Alou said, ''When they came back from lunch, it was too late.'',Alou's contract with Montreal had this year remaining. The Expos offered to add two years and raise his salary to what will amount to $2 million a year. Alou has never been about money, but the Expos, in effect, are rewarding him for his quarter century of service and extreme loyalty to the organization.,''Kevin Malone and Bob Graziano are two beautiful people, great people,'' Alou said. ''Kevin and I have a lot in common. I didn't know Graziano. What a wonderful person he is. I was caught in the middle. I decided to stay with the Expos.'',Why did he pass up the chance to see how the wealthy teams in baseball live? Alou cited his years with the Montreal organization, the effort the team's representatives made by traveling to his home and the fact that his wife is from Montreal and two of his children were born there.,''I know the possibility of being in the World Series was attached to managing the Dodgers,'' Alou said. ''But there are times when you are so committed to something. If you tie a dog to a chain for a long time, chances are that when you try to turn that dog loose he can't go anywhere. I believe that's what happened to me. The permission was granted for me to leave. I talked to the people who wanted me, and they had everything that I asked and more. Instead, I turned around and stayed where I was.'',Beattie said that knowing Alou, he was not really surprised that he opted to stay. Malone also knows Alou.,''I was disappointed,'' Malone said, ''but I think that was more from a friendship standpoint. It didn't surprise me. I felt he did what was right for him.'',Rest, on His Own Terms,And on the day of the 2,633d game, Cal Ripken rested.,That was last Sept. 20, when the Baltimore Orioles played the Yankees and Ripken removed himself from the lineup. After having played three seasons and 502 games beyond Lou Gehrig's fabled 2,130-game streak, Ripken decided to end his own mind-boggling, body-defying streak.,''I've had no regrets, no feeling of euphoria, no feeling of sadness,'' the 38-year-old third baseman said. ''Everything seems very normal to me. There's no relief, no sadness, no jumping up and down. It just seems normal.'',Ripken, who had last missed a game 16 1/2 seasons earlier -- that's 16 1/2 seasons -- said there was not necessarily one reason he could cite for his decision to sit down that night, but he offered one thought.,''I was always uncomfortable that the streak sometimes would overshadow the team,'' he said, countering the suggestion of his critics that he was always more interested in the streak than the team.,''I wanted to put the focus back to where it should be. I don't like the focus to go away from the team. I just come out to play and try to help you win. When the focus starts getting pulled away from that, it can almost be seen as counterproductive to your team and it's time to put the focus back where it is.'',Why did he pick that game?,''It just seemed that the timing was right,'' he said. ''I made up my mind if we fell out of the wild-card race, if we couldn't get back in it and the games didn't mean anything toward the end, then I'm going to take a day off.'',Ray Miller, the Orioles' manager, said he plans to give Ripken a day off now and then. How will it feel having time off? Ripken said he did not know.,''That's uncharted territory for me,'' he said. ''I just know what it's like to play 162 games.'',Malone Defends Himself,Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, took exception to the charge by executives of other clubs, reported here last week, that he has hired scouting and player development people away from other teams by offering gobs of ''Murdoch money.'',''This is not true,'' Malone said. ''I've never said, 'I've struck an oil well; are you ready to leave?' I recognize I have the resources, but I didn't say that.'',Two executives Malone has hired as assistant general managers were specifically mentioned, Ed Creech, formerly of St. Louis, and Bill Geivett, formerly of Tampa Bay.,''Creech and Geivett coming to work for me had nothing to do with money,'' Malone said. ''Creech was unhappy there. These people who have come with me wanted to work with me. Creech and Geivett are probably the two lowest-paid assistant general managers.'',The Curious Strike Zone,The edict from the commissioner's office that the strike zone commonly called by umpires will be raised to two inches above the top of the uniform pants has people puzzled. The memo notes that the upper limit of the strike zone, as defined in the rule book, is a line midway between the top of the shoulders and the top of the pants.,That line is well above two inches above the pants -- unless the batter is Ed Grimley, the old Martin Short character from ''Saturday Night Live.''",MURRAY CHASS,"FEB. 28, 1999","BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK; When Loyalty Talked, Manager Didn't Walk",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/baseball-notebook-when-loyalty-talked-manager-didn-t-walk.html

"Edgardo Alfonzo would like to know what the fuss is all about.,After all, it's not as if he hasn't played second base before. He did it in 1994 when a phenom named Rey Ordonez was promoted from Class A St. Lucie to Class AA Binghamton midway through the season. Alfonzo had been the Binghamton shortstop, but he moved to second to make room for Ordonez.,''I can honestly say that's what won a championship for us,'' said John Tamargo, who was then the Binghamton manager and is now the Houston Astros' bullpen coach. ''Nothing got through the middle of that infield. And Alfonzo ended up doing a great job.'',He did such a great job that in 1995, Alfonzo made the jump from Class AA to the major leagues. Over the next two seasons, he made 75 starts at second base for the Mets, but for the last two seasons he played mostly at third base, where his defensive play was among the best in the National League.,But in their efforts to shore up the team's offense, the Mets signed Robin Ventura for $32 million over the next four years. Since Ventura plays third base, Alfonzo is back at second.,The Mets asked Alfonzo if he was willing to make the switch, but in truth they were making the move whether he liked it or not.,''It wouldn't have changed our mind one way or the other,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''We knew he'd play where we needed him to play. Even if he was disappointed with it, he could have at least felt that we valued his opinion.'',Alfonzo shrugged it all off. Never mind that at the end of last season, he said he had become comfortable in his role at third base. Or that last season's second baseman, Carlos Baerga, was one of Alfonzo's best friends on the team.,If the Mets wanted him to play second, he would play second. Alfonzo used to take grounders there last season during batting practice, anyway.,So what if he played third base in Venezuela during winter ball? He worked out at second every day before the games. It undoubtedly helped ease the transition when he was signed to a four-year, $18.4 million deal with the Mets in the off season.,''I told the Mets if we're going to be a better team, I'll give it a chance,'' Alfonzo said. ''I mean, I've played there before.'',He and Ordonez have always played well together, too, dating back to the days when they were first paired together in the minor leagues.,''They were immediately comfortable with one another,'' said Phillips, who was the Mets' director of the minor leagues in 1994.,''They picked each other up,'' Tamargo said.,This spring, Alfonzo and Ordonez have six weeks to rekindle the spark.,There are some questions, however. First, Alfonzo has filled out since his minor league days. That could cause some problems because he might not be as flexible as he once was, and Ordonez delivers the ball hard to second base. Given Alfonzo's history of back problems, it remains to be seen how well he will stand up to runners bearing down on him as he attempts to turn double plays.,The Mets don't seem worried, however. Manager Bobby Valentine has said this spring that he has no doubts that Alfonzo will handle second well. Ditto Phillips and Ordonez.,No wonder Alfonzo has brought a ''what, me worry?'' attitude into camp.,''It will only take a couple of days to get myself back again,'' Alfonzo said.,If so, the Mets' infield will be formidable. Ordonez has won the last two Gold Gloves at shortstop -- he said last week that the only way he could improve was if he could learn to retrieve a ball from the clouds -- and Ventura has won five at third base. First baseman John Olerud is underrated but solid. He joked that he may be this infield's weak link.,If Alfonzo can pick up where he left off with Ordonez, the Mets might find themselves with the most stingy infield in the major leagues.,''Working with guys for years, you get a feel for them,'' said Tamargo, who was also Alfonzo's winter league coach with Magallanes in Venezuela for two seasons. ''But those guys were making plays right off the bat. It was just a click from the beginning.'',Five years later, the Mets are hoping things will click again.,INSIDE PITCH,General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said that the Mets would not mind adding another front-line starting pitcher to buttress their rotation, but he added that the price will be steep for someone who fits that description. ''When you have so many people looking for the same thing, if one becomes available, what you have to give is going to be significant,'' said Phillips. Philadelphia's CURT SCHILLING has been mentioned as a pitcher who could be traded, but the Mets do not think he would be comfortable in New York. . . .

"IF the structural changes made to the Yale Center for British Art's building in New Haven are almost imperceptible to visitors, it's clear that the three exhibitions in the gallery's reopening after a year of construction and repairs give the place a dynamism that shouts its comeback.,The shows have an obvious common thread; they are devoted to three major British artists of the 20th century whose art was once controversial: Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud and Henry Moore. The Bacon exhibition is drawing the most comment and rightfully so. It is a splashy retrospective containing about 70 paintings.,But the earliest, from 1933, is a small Crucifixion whose bony figure derived from Surrealism presages Bacon's patented distortion of the human body. Bacon (1909-1992) evidently found his potent idiom early, and progressed by stuffing it with more raw, tortured energy. What might be called early surrogates for  familiar human figures include not only the Sphinx but also animals, especially a baboon given a remarkably evanescent silvery fur coat.,The 1952 painting of the baboon is called a study, yet it measures 78 inches by 54 inches. The expansive size of postwar American paintings is often remarked on, but Bacon more than holds his own on any scale of expansive. The public's fascination with the writhing and contortion of Bacon's figures might have obscured the realization of his brilliance as a colorist.,The plight of his figures is made all the more harsh when played out against backgrounds often tropically hedonistic. Bacon's sense of theater has always been recognized; his characters are often confined to what seem like cramped, dimly lit stages, or circus arenas -- and sometimes barred windows are indicated.,In addition to illuminating the anxiety of modern life, or perhaps to intensify it, Bacon occasionally savaged art history masterpieces, the most famous being variations on Velasquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X. Bacon's pope is an angry prisoner of his office. Van Gogh is evoked twice in the exhibition; his wistful idealism is offset by the climate in which Bacon places him, largely indicated through an intense red and green.,In 1982 Bacon painted ''Oedipus and the Sphinx after Ingres,'' which he heats up through a shocking pink background. Oedipus's foot, injured when he was a child, is still bandaged and bleeding in Bacon but the painting contains an annoying device: Bacon tended to indicate significant parts of a painting by either putting a circle around them or pointing at them with an arrow. But Bacon mastered the multi-panel mode, which he began to explore in the 1960's.,Sometimes he does triple the intensity. An early portrait triptych,  ''Three Studies for a Portrait of George Dyer (On Light Ground),'' features his longtime partner and illustrates Bacon's peculiar brand of distortion. He smears paint to get a Picasso-like look, and Dyer looks like he's been subjected to something more than an analytical faceting of form; he looks as if he's been beaten up. To some extent most of Bacon's figures share this sensation of a pummeling.,Doing what made him a singular painter seems to have come easy for Bacon in the 80's. Paint isn't used in such a bravura way, and his tormented expressions seem to have acquired ball bearings.,Lucien Freud, who was born in 1922, is sometimes seen as a successor to Bacon because his figure paintings are exaggeratedly fleshy. But his more decorous etchings -- 42 from the collection of Paine Webber having the bad luck to share a floor with part of the Bacon show -- have a different emphasis. Freud's line is firm, and the figures, even the grosser ones, seem solid and oddly alike. About the only variety in the show is a thistle, masterfully rendered, and a small tattoo on a woman's arm.,It's not so much the similarity of the figures that goads a viewer to hurry through the show, but the fact that most of the figures loll about. An alert self-portrait is a rare exception to the general soporific mood.,It's tempting to say that, in the explosion of art, Henry Moore is relegated to the entrance lobby. But that space is advantageous because its dimensions allows viewers to circumnavigate the sculptures, and if any sculpture needs to be seen in the round, it is Moore's.,The show, which marks the artist's centenary, is titled, ''Henry Moore and the Heroic.'' A couple of the most compelling pieces reflect this: they evoke soldiers of ancient Greece who have fallen in battle. Representing the bronze age, they are made of bronze with a green patina. A related work is ''Helmet Head, No. 3'' from the center's collection; a head with vigilant eyes lurks out through an opening in the front of the shell.,But another strong theme, peace, is the counterpart of war. The exhibition is especially strong in family groupings, including tender Mary Cassatt-like mothers and children. In other hands such sculptures would be sappy, but the heroism attributed to Moore affects these works, too.,The exhibitions of works by Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud and Henry Moore remain at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven through March 21.",WILLIAM ZIMMER,"FEB. 28, 1999",Bacon Is the Star Of Yale Reopening,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/bacon-is-the-star-of-yale-reopening.html
"Try to remember. It was only two years ago, back when the Olympics were pure and Latrell Sprewell was merely an obscure All-Star, that the Yankees bought David Wells as a quick fix to get the team back to the World Series. We didn't love him right away. If a fat, undisciplined loudmouth could wear pinstripes, what was our excuse? But the Boomer turned out to be perfect as well as imperfect, and he helped us be No. 1 again.,And now he's gone and we have a supposedly better-model Boomer, disciplined, more discreet, with seemingly more impressive numbers. Roger Clemens was not greeted with a universal welcome. Commentators called it greed, disloyalty, a quick fix that would destroy the winning ''chemistry'' of the Yankee clubhouse.,''Chemistry, grow up,'' snapped Jane Heller of Stuart, Fla., one of the Yankee-ologists I periodically check for reality checks. ''People change every year and so does the chemistry. The underpaid kid Derek Jeter is now an overpaid heartthrob. Bernie Williams is different, Darryl is certainly different. It was a business decision that brought Wells, and a business decision that replaced him with Clemens.'',Business, indeed. Who would have thought that the mightiest mark in sports, the Yankees, would climb into bed with the lowly Nets? And yet that made sense, too. George Steinbrenner loaded his bases for another round with Cablevision to make a television deal. If Cablevision doesn't step up, the Yankees and the Nets could go into competition with the company that owns the Rangers and the Knicks.,Quick fix? What do you think Mark Messier was? Especially after Coach Mike Keenan arrived. Sprewell is another quick fix that looks good. Like Clemens?,''Slow down, we'll see,'' rumbled Roger Sims of Everett, Wash., another reality checker. ''Look at the stats. Sure, Clemens is going to the Hall of Fame, but don't be so sure he's taking us with him. He was 20-6 last season and Wells was 18-4. But add Wells's post-season, you've got 22-4. And strikeouts can take a lot out of an arm. A ground ball on the second pitch can be better. An out's an out.'',Heller, the author of such comic mysteries as the forthcoming ''Sis Boom Bah,'' says that she used to hate Clemens, especially when he drilled her favorite Yankees. ''But then I once hated Wade Boggs, and I ended up loving him.'',Less demonstrative, Sims, a retired TV news producer, would not commit emotionally to Clemens, but did say: ''I am a long-time Steinbrenner hater. I applaud him for this. And it hurts me.'',The quickest fix in sports these days may be the International Olympic Committee's attempt to move beyond what a spokesman calls ''some unethical behavior.'' The I.O.C. needs to do this before sponsors pull out and fans begin to regard the Games as merely another entertainment spectacular, like Ice Follies, Super Bowls and Demolition Derbies. Without its carefully cultivated veneer of a peace-bringing spiritual movement, the Olympics would simply be a pretentious track meet.,The deputy director for press relations of the I.O.C., Franklin Servan-Schrieber, was sharply critical of my report from Los Angeles last week that suggested ''systemic corruption'' as part of a longtime Olympic culture. The article went on to link the current Salt Lake City scandal to the blind, if not approving, eye that Avery Brundage and other officials turned on the so-called 1936 Nazi Olympics, in Berlin.,''We must be very careful about moral lessons,'' said Servan-Schrieber, a historian, speaking from I.O.C. headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. ''The most requested video at the Olympic Museum is Jesse Owens running victoriously in 1936. He was showing the world the truth about race. The judgment of history was a message of hope. That was a dark time in our history and everyone was tested. The Simon Wiesenthal Center has done good things, but what did they want to achieve by ruining the name of the Olympics?'',The Wiesenthal Center had rummaged through the Brundage papers at the University of Illinois and found unsettling letters. One was from Sigfrid Edstrom of Sweden, an I.O.C. president, suggesting that America handle its Jewish problem as efficiently as the Germans were doing. Another letter confirmed that Brundage had bid on, and won, a contract to help build the German Embassy in Washington after the Berlin Olympics. World War II canceled that contract. But it did not cancel the sense of impropriety and arrogance in such an arrangement, if not outright graft.,Servan-Schrieber dismissed such a possibility. The only graft in Olympic history, he maintained, was limited to Salt Lake City. It was being fixed.",ROBERT LIPSYTE,"FEB. 28, 1999","BACKTALK; Quick Fix: Fudge It, Then Fix It Quickly",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/sports/backtalk-quick-fix-fudge-it-then-fix-it-quickly.html
"New Jersey, the car capital of the United States? From a vantage point on the turnpike high above auto terminals at the port  on Newark Bay, and not far from the auto marine terminal in Jersey City and Bayonne, it might seem that way.,Acres and acres of new cars, side by side, bumper to bumper, sit glistening in the sun, waiting to be shipped to showrooms in the Northeast or abroad.,''Sort of like a sea of cars,'' said Eugene Spruck, currently the chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ''It's a very impressive sight.'',The visual impact is not all that is impressive. Importing and exporting cars and trucks pumps $1.2 billion a year into the New Jersey economy each year and provides about 10,000 jobs, Mr. Spruck says.,That is only the tip of the bumper. Consider this:,* New Jersey is the North American headquarters for such foreign automakers as Aston Martin, BMW, Ferrari, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Rolls-Royce, Subaru and Volvo. Other companies like Daewoo have regional offices or other complexes here.,* New Jersey also serves as worldwide headquarters for Hertz Corporation, the nation's No. 1 car rental company.,* Ford Motor Company has a 1.5 million square-foot plant in Edison that annually produces 130,500 Ford Ranger pickups and Mazda B-Series compact pickups; and General Motors Corporation has a 2.7 million square-foot assembly plant in Linden that last year manufactured a total of 178,797  Chevy S10's and GMC Sonoma's, small pickups, and Chevy Blazer, GMC Jimmy and Oldsmobile Bravada, all midsize sport utility vehicles.,* The automobile and truck industry in the state -- including manufacturing, wholesale, retail and automotive repair and services -- created 108,475 jobs in 1997, up O.7 percent from 1995, according to the state Department of Commerce.,* About 800 dealerships statewide generated nearly $670 million in state taxes in 1997, according to the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, a trade group.,In addition, some innovative designing is going on here. The Subaru Outback, the Japanese carmaker's hybrid sport utility vehicle built on a passenger car ''platform'' rather than a truck frame like other SUV's, was designed in Cherry Hill.,And the idea for Saturn's three-door sedan coupe, introduced in the 1999 models, was hatched when a dealer with franchises in Morristown, Livingston and Denville saw that his 8-year-old son was having trouble getting out of the cramped back seat.,So the question is worth repeating. New Jersey, the car capital of the United States?,''I don't think that's so far-fetched,'' said Richard Marshall, corporate communications director of Subaru of America Inc., with headquarters in Cherry Hill. ''I think that New Jersey is a very vibrant place for the automobile industry and an important contributor to what's going on.'',Four hundred of Subaru's 800 employees in the United States work in New Jersey and last year the company contributed more than $51 million to the state economy.,Aside from Subaru, BMW of North America Inc., with 594 employees in New Jersey, was the only carmaker to release information on the property taxes it pays in New Jersey, $1.1 million, but did not divulge payroll figures.,The Ford plant in Edison, with 1,519 employees, has an annual payroll of $89.4 million and pays $1.6 million in property taxes, said Kathleen Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the automaker.,The GM plant in Linden, with 2,563 employees, has an annual payroll and benefits of $250 million and paid $2.6 million in property taxes in 1998, said David Caldwell, a spokesman for the truck group.,Subaru, the only Asian car company with headquarters in New Jersey, is also the only company situated in the southern part of the state. The other foreign carmakers, all European, have settled in Bergen County. And many manufacturers, like BMW -- on 40 acres of former farmland in Woodcliff Lake -- have exquisite campus-like settings.,BMW's were first imported by the Hoffman Motor Company in nearby Montvale in the early 1970's. When BMW of North America bought Hoffman in 1975 it chose to stay in Bergen County, and moved to its current site in 1989.,''At the time, land was plentiful,'' said Martha McKinley, a spokeswoman for BMW. ''Quality of life was high, with proximity to Manhattan and all the business support functions and cultural opportunities located there.'',Officials of other companies said other factors that convinced them to establish headquarters in the state included access to  airports, distributors, and a large and well-educated labor pool.,Carlo Fiorani of Ferrari of North America, which has 29 employees at headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, said the proximity to Manhattan and Newark International Airport was also a factor in its choice.,Jaguar North America, with 175 employees in Mahwah, moved to New Jersey from midtown Manhattan in 1968 because it needed more space and a warehouse complex, said Whitney Said, a spokesman. Aston-Martin Lagonda of North America leases space from Jaguar.,Mercedes-Benz of North America began renting space in Fort Lee in 1965, and in 1972 moved to its current site in Montvale, a 300,000 square-foot building situated on 40 acres. It employs about 750 people, including part-time employees and consultants.,Volvo Cars of North America Inc., with headquarters in Rockleigh, employs about 650 people there and at sites in Rutherford and Montvale and the port in Newark.,John Nothwang, executive vice president and general manager of the Americas and Pacific for Hertz Corporation, which employs 1,100 people in its headquarters in Park Ridge as well as 30 rental locations in the state, said it was not the concentration of so many car companies here that convinced Hertz to leave Manhattan in 1988.,''The decision was made like a lot of companies that are relocating,'' Mr. Nothwang said. ''Access to public transportation, favorable work environment, strong educated work force, communities that have good schools.'',The result, Mr. Spruck, the port authority's economist, pointed out, is as plain as the hood ornament on a Mercedes. ''New Jersey is the second largest port in the country for importation of automobiles,'' he said, followed by Los Angeles. ''It's almost a thousand a day on the inbound.'',To be precise, 332,000 vehicles came through New Jersey ports in 1997, and 96,000 were shipped out.,For Stuart Lasser, the Saturn dealer who has been selling cars for 22 years, New Jersey is the heart of the auto trade. One day, when he brought home a red coupe at the request of his son, Hal, who was 8 at the time, he noticed the boy had trouble getting into the back seat. That's how he came to suggest a second door on the driver's side, a move that Saturn says has helped increase sales 30 percent.,For all of this, however, there is an accompanying ambivalence, says Michael Aaron Rockland, chairman of American Studies at Rutgers University who co-wrote ''Looking For America on the New Jersey Turnpike'' (Rutgers, 1989).,Professor Rockland said the car was a mixed blessing, providing mobility and bolstering the economy but also contributing to the decline of the state's cities and sense of community.,''The automobile,'' he said, ''is the tail that wags the dog of New Jersey life.''",GEORGE JAMES,"FEB. 28, 1999","Auto Industry Keeps the State in the Fast Lane; From Regional Offices To Ports and Plants, Big Part of Economy",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/auto-industry-keeps-state-fast-lane-regional-offices-ports-plants-big-part.html
"Irish and British officials are looking increasingly to President Clinton for another intervention in the Northern Ireland peace effort, hoping he can end the dispute over the disarmament of the Irish Republican Army.,The dispute threatens to end attempts by Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders to achieve lasting peace in the northern British province.,The President's involvement, including two widely acclaimed visits to Ireland, is credited here as essential to the advance of the peace agreement approved by Protestant and Catholic leaders 10 months ago and overwhelmingly endorsed in referendums here and in the North.,Officials here and in Belfast, the northern capital, have indicated clearly in recent days that if the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast fails to resolve the disarmament dispute by mid-March, then the President is likely to try to persuade Protestant and Catholic political leaders to meet during their scheduled visit to the White House on St. Patrick's Day, March 17.,Michael J. Sullivan, the new American Ambassador to Ireland and a former Governor of Wyoming, said on Friday that he would not speculate on the specifics of the involvement of Mr. Clinton, who is a personal friend. But he added, ''The President is deeply interested and anxious to see the peace agreement implemented.'',Last week, on his first visit to Northern Ireland, Mr. Sullivan, who became the Ambassador six weeks ago, discussed the dispute with the Assembly's two leaders, the Protestant First Minister, David Trimble, and his Catholic deputy, Seamus Mallon.,He was accompanied by James Lyons, Mr. Clinton's economic adviser for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.,That post was previously held by former Senator George J. Mitchell, who became chairman of the peace talks that produced a formal agreement last Easter to end the sectarian warfare involving the province's Protestant majority and its Catholic minority.,The Americans did not meet officials of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, or of the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which vehemently opposes the peace pact.",JAMES F.

"NOW that the panic has died down, anger has set in.,''We'll go wherever we have to go and do whatever we have to do,'' County Legislator Bernice Spreckman, Republican of Yonkers, said last week, infuriated that some of her elderly constituents had been dropped by their health care insurers. ''And if it means we have to storm the state capital, so be it!'',The first round of bad news arrived last fall, when Oxford Health Plans in White Plains, one of the largest health maintenance organizations in the New York City area, told thousands of elderly people in Westchester and elsewhere that it would no longer provide Medicare benefits.,As word spread of more H.M.O.'s pulling out of the Medicare business, an estimated 19,000 elderly residents arrived by the busloads in White Plains to attend a county-sponsored health fair on a bitterly cold morning in early December. ''It was a mob scene, with everyone hoping to sign up for alternative plans,'' recalled Mae Carpenter, director of the county's Office for the Aging. ''Everyone had to take a number and wait their turn.'',Some people found options, even if they were more expensive and complicated than their past insurance plans. Others were not so lucky. Insurers still in the Medicare business, like the Blue Choice Senior Plan of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, refused to accept any elderly people with pre-existing conditions like kidney failure. People who were vulnerable and often very ill were forced to return to the basic Government-provided Medicare -- the federally financed health insurance program for people 65 and older or younger than 65 and disabled -- which covers part of their medical bills and none of their prescription costs.,Federal officials emphasize that the traditional Medicare program is always available, but they acknowledge that it often costs more than an H.M.O., and they say there is no guarantee that beneficiaries can obtain Medigap -- supplemental insurance used to fill in where traditional government coverage leaves off -- policies covering prescription drugs, one of the biggest expenses for people who are elderly or disabled.,With her husband, Allen, on dialysis three days a week, minimum coverage from traditional Medicare and the pharmacy bills continuing to mount, Philomena Martin, 71, said recently that their golden years had become tarnished.,''I don't know what an H.M.O. is for,'' Mrs. Martin of Dobbs Ferry said. ''When you're young and healthy? We had no plans for retirement, and we're not worried about traveling, but we do want to be able to live a simple life, to survive each day.'',Last year, health maintenance organizations in 30 states announced they were leaving unprofitable Medicare markets, forcing more than 440,000 elderly Americans to replace their coverage. The companies said they were losing money on Medicare in part because Government rates or premiums, which used to go up about 8 percent each year, are capped at a rate of 2 percent a year for five years by the Balanced Budget Act.,''We did everything we could to prevent it, but we were unable to meet the costs of goods and services,'' Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans, said last week, explaining that the group attempted to negotiate with the Federal Government for better rates. ''It came down to choosing between providing an inferior product and getting out.'' The Washington-based group represents the managed care industry.,Statements from big insurers weighing profits and the struggles of elderly people like the Martins, who are worrying about meeting the mounting cost of old age, have angered the 30 members of the county's Board of Legislators Task Force on Aging.,Mrs. Spreckman, who at 63 is approaching senior citizen status herself, said many elderly residents are increasingly aware that they represent a sizable voting bloc.,''There's definitely going to be some political action in Albany,'' Mrs. Spreckman said. ''We're going to go up there in large numbers and fight for what we want.'' That includes broader pharmacy benefits and earlier notice of coverage being discontinued, among other things.,As of 1997, there were 130,535 people older than 65 in Westchester, according to the most recent census  estimates. That represents nearly 15 percent of the county's total population of 896,221.,Also, the oldest residents, those 85 and older, continue to have the highest rate of growth -- ''increasing the need for services and care for the most vulnerable members of our elderly population,'' as reported in a 1994 study by the county's Office for the Aging. The 1990 census reported that those 85 and older in Westchester numbered 14,200, up 36 percent since 1980. At latest count, that figure rose to 16,664.,''So the big interests and big dollar groups better watch out,'' said Mrs. Spreckman, who is chairwoman of the task force. ''And if the elected officials go against us, they're going to have a problem, too, because they won't get our votes next time.'',The task force, with the aid of Perry M. Ochacher, one of two lobbyists for the Board of Legislators, met on Monday at the County Office Building in White Plains to prepare a proposal to protect the elderly.,The 45-year-old George S. Latimer,  Chairman of the Board of Legislators, called the seniors who were preparing the legislative package pioneers.,''The battles you're fighting today,'' he told them, ''I'll be fighting down the road.'',County Executive Andrew J. Spano also attended the meeting and said he supported the group's new political thrust.,Mrs. Carpenter, who is also a task force member, said: ''We don't want to have to go through this again. There has been so much worry, and we were left to pick up the pieces. People were asking: 'How will I get my medicine? How will I get my treatment?' '',She said the companies that pulled out of the formerly lucrative market for many managed-care companies did so with a single, impersonal letter to elderly customers, leaving a ''trail of devastation behind them.'',Antonia Torres, 71, a Yonkers resident, received a ''cold, business-like'' correspondence from her insurer, her daughter Carmen recalled. ''And there was nothing we could do about it.'',Like Mr. Martin in Dobbs Ferry, Antonia Torres had begun dialysis treatments while enrolled in Oxford's plan.,''The ordeal began when the others found out that mom was already on dialysis,'' Carmen Torres said. ''They wouldn't take her.'',Because the elderly mother also needs home care, insulin, syringes, blood thinners and other drugs, her daughter arranged for alternative insurance through the American Association of Retired Persons.,''We found a solution, sort of, although an expensive solution,'' Ms. Torres said, ''but now life revolves around paying the bills.'',When health maintenance organizations were first introduced to elderly residents, many worried that if profit margins shrunk, the companies would drop the Medicare business altogether. As a result, only some older people switched from traditional Medicare to new doctors and the hope that the H.M.O.'s would cost them less. In Westchester, about 13,978 elderly residents were affected by Oxford's pullout in October.,But because Medicare's fee-for-service program carries a much higher out-of-pocket cost, some elderly have enrolled in Medigap. Medigap insurance, however, can cost a few thousand dollars a year for the deductibles, co-insurance payments and other outlays that traditional Medicare does not cover.,Also, there is no guarantee that older people can obtain Medigap insurance covering prescription drugs.  According to the American Association of Retired Persons, prescriptions cost elderly people an average of $351 a year.,In Dobbs Ferry, Mrs. Martin said that her husband's prescriptions cost  $100 a month. They are not sure how much of the cost of dialysis, under traditional Medicare, they will have to pay.,''The question is, are we going to make ends meet?'' she said recently. ''We're not looking for a handout, but we do want to be able to take care of ourselves.'' To cover some of the bills, Mr. Martin, the former manager of an electronics store, drives a van for seniors, wedging in his dialysis treatments three times a week.,Because Ms. Pisano, the spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans, and others have speculated that more health maintenance organizations may pull out of the Medicare business, Mrs. Spreckman and Ms. Carpenter said they wanted the elderly to be prepared for the news.,Mrs. Carpenter described the situation as bedlam last fall after Oxford announced its pullout. She said the Office for the Aging had been overwhelmed with calls from seniors in the last quarter of 1998. In January, there were still more calls coming in from seniors worried about receiving their identification cards from new insurers.,As William A. Martimucci, a Mamaroneck geriatrician, explained, ''Continuity in health care is always important, but for the elderly, it's that much more important.'',In a related trend, as doctors grow more frustrated with managed care policies, they are seeking to unionize -- especially with more than 90 percent of the doctors in the United States having at least one contract with a managed care company. Many doctors said they have lost authority and have seen a drop in reimbursements in citing reasons for wanting to join a union.,Mrs. Carpenter said lateness and slowness of payments led many doctors to withdraw from some plans.,Dr. Martimucci would not comment on his experiences with health maintenance organizations. But Sally Robinson, director of Yonkers' Office for the Aging, observed that despite what the best-case scenario might be for doctors and others, ''Seniors have had no choice but to adjust'' to the changes in managed care. At first, she said, there was a lot of fear and confusion and a feeling of abandonment among the elderly when Oxford announced its decision.,Still, Mrs. Spreckman said that by exerting political power, the elderly could obtain a better outcome. She said the task force will lobby Albany this spring for an expansion of the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program to allow participation by moderate-income seniors. Under the program, nearly 100,000 low-income seniors are obtaining prescriptions at a savings of more than 50 percent. But, according to the task force, ''the substantial costs of prescription medications today, and the lack of any Medicare coverage for such costs, presents the same problem for seniors with moderate incomes.'' Under current law, single seniors with incomes greater than $18,500 and married seniors with joint incomes over $24,400 are not eligible.,The task force will also seek a requirement that health insurers offer six months' notice of discontinuance of coverage. ''Although two months' notice of discontinuance is all that is currently required by the Federal regulations applicable to such plans, it is simply not a sufficient amount of time,'' the task force said.,Other proposals include imposing liability on insurers for death or injury to a patient by reason of the delay, failure or refusal of coverage.",ELSA BRENNER,"FEB. 28, 1999","As H.M.O.'s Flee, the Elderly Wonder, Who Pays Now?",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/as-hmo-s-flee-the-elderly-wonder-who-pays-now.html
"A  FRIEND to many, and admired for her elegance, loyalty and tact, Betty Parsons has long had a niche in history as the art dealer behind such notable figures as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Barnett Newman. Now, she is the focus not only of an exhibition on her life, her work and her artists, but also of an all-day symposium.,The symposium, ''Betty Parsons: Artist and Dealer,'' at the Heckscher tomorrow starting at 10 A.M. (information: 351-3250), features specialists in American art discussing issues like the artist as art dealer, the plight of the female artist in the Abstract Expressionist era, and the interrelationships between the Parsons artists.,A part-time Southold resident who died in 1982, Parsons had ties to the Island that evoked history in another sense, too. Her ancestors included the Rev. Abraham Pierson, who had arrived in Southampton in 1640 to serve as the village's first minister.,''She probably chose Southold rather than Southampton, where she had many ties, to be able to have a refuge and devote herself to painting, which she could only do on weekends,'' said Anne Cohen DePietro, curator of the exhibition, ''Shaping a Generation: The Art and Artists of Betty Parsons,'' on view through April 18 at the Heckscher Museum in Huntington.,Parsons's life was divided into fascinating chapters, with her feeling for art as a strong unifying thread. Born in 1900 into the Piersons, a New York City family of prestige and wealth, she had the education and finishing-school training that was considered proper for young ladies of her status, and at 20 she married Schuyler Parsons, a man from the same social circle. They divorced in Paris three years later, but she remained there for 11 years, becoming part of that city's famous group of expatriate writers and artists who flourished in the 1920's. When the Depression depleted the family fortune, she returned to the United States in 1933.,During a visit to the famous Armory Show as a schoolgirl in 1913, Parsons had been impressed with the excitement, the originality and the range of invention. She soon began to study sculpture, overcoming her family's objections only with great difficulty. Her studies continued in Paris, and her long list of solo exhibitions of painting and sculpture begins in the mid-30's.,Although she tried to survive as an artist after she returned from Europe, living first in California and then in New York, she needed regular employment. That opportunity came when the Midtown Galleries, where she had been exhibiting, offered her a position as a sales assistant. In 1940, the Wakefield Bookshop asked her to manage its art gallery. By 1944 she was managing the modern section of the Mortimer Brandt Gallery, and when Brandt moved to England two years later, she opened her own gallery in that space at the urging of her artists. With a keen eye, she had been discovering and exhibiting the work of artists she felt had merit, giving many their first shows.,When Peggy Guggenheim closed her Art of This Century gallery and returned to Europe in 1947, her artists, including Pollock and Rothko, were eager to be part of the Betty Parsons Gallery. This, then, became the place where Pollock's great achievements from 1947 through 1951 were introduced, including the large ''Autumn Rhythm,'' ''Lavender Mist'' and ''One,'' all shown in the recent Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. Important phases in the development of many other participants in the the New York School were also first shown there.,''She always paid particular attention to those who were enlarging horizons,'' said Hedda Sterne, who had her first one-woman exhibition at the Wakefield space and remained a lifelong friend of Parsons. ''Betty had the correct instincts, but there was also something spontaneous and pure about her. Even though she became a success, she never aimed for success. It was destiny. She had the mentality of an artist and was somewhat embarrassed to be 'in trade.' '',Gwen Metz, a close friend and former gallery staff member, added: ''It is important to not overlook her focus, which was the new, the creative, the unknown. Betty was interested in the creative note, and not in fame.'' Ms. Metz worries that the gallery will be remembered just for the eventual celebrity of some of the roster.,Parsons kept her own art separate from the gallery operations. Her painting style changed in 1947, turning from small landscapes and portraits into a bold, subjective abstraction that represented a response to the stimuli of her surroundings. Most often this was her North Fork cliff site on the water's edge, but sometimes the pieces reflect her travels to the Caribbean and abroad. Always a strong colorist, she became even more so.,At one point, she began to collect scraps of carpenter's fragments and other wood debris found along the shoreline and started a series of painted assemblages. Two of the museum's galleries are devoted to the Parsons art. ''Our aim was to bring out the whimsy and remarkable energy,'' Ms. DePietro said.,A third gallery features a sampling of the artists represented in Parsons's own collection, which was dispersed after her death.,''Much of the collection was based on gifts,'' Ms. Metz said. ''Artists wanted Betty to have a piece; Betty admired the work, and I think they wanted to be in her collection. She bought work as well, of course, and often traded with artists.'',If it was not possible to borrow a piece that originally belonged to Parsons for the Heckscher show, the substitute is a work that corresponds to the period when the artist was exhibiting with her. Highlights include examples by Pollock, Rothko, Paul Feeley, Phillip Guston, Ellsworth Kelly, Kenzo Okada, Richard Pousette-Dart, Ad Reinhardt, Theodoros Stamos, Saul Steinberg and Richard Tuttle.,In a sense, Parsons is still shaping a generation, for her assets established a foundation that gives grants to organizations dedicated to assisting emerging artists.

"THE exhibition at the Blue Hill Cultural Center here, ''Yin and Yang: Two Views of the Earth,'' pairs the works of two vastly dissimilar artists, Robert Dell and the late Alan Gussow, in an attempt to suggest nature's realm of possibilities.,At one end of the spectrum is the two-dimensional work of Mr. Gussow, who died in 1997 and was board chairman of the Earth Foundation and the America the Beautiful Fund. For decades, he produced images that expressed nature's mysterious beauty, making it easy to see his instinctive connection to the earth.,At the other end of the spectrum is the recent work of Robert Dell. His large, free-standing and unearthly looking structures garner energy from the natural changes in ambient air temperature, moisture and wind through a complex system of electronics, which in turn activate lasers and LED, or incandescent, lights, which can be viewed through rock crystals contained in the sculptures.,For this and other interior installations like it, Mr. Dell designed a heart-and-lung machine look-alike, a geothermal simulator to power his sculptures, a system he developed at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. How Mr. Dell simulates nature's energy to power his sculptures is brilliant. That they are put indoors and away from the natural setting they were created for seems to defeat the purpose of these works.,It is like riding a bicycle in one's living room. It reduces the effect to the point of frustration. The result is that Mr. Dell's art seems trapped -- left to make its case within the very space it needs to repel. As installed, indoors and adjacent to an area that resists contemplation, it all comes off as industrial strength posturing by way of baffling technology.,Mr. Dell's smaller, pedestal-size works, which are unpowered, are much easier to relate to and work best in this complicated hybrid of a corporate-looking mall space. ''Nelson's Metals'' (1987), a steel, aluminum, copper and bronze sculpture, reminded me of a distilled version of Picasso's ''Three Musicians.'' The interaction between the three standing forms and what appears to be a kettle drum is pleasant from any angle. The brushed roughness of the largest surfaces of the sculpture maintains a certain spontaneity, allowing the physical elements to master the surrounding space.,One detail, an indentation in the upper fifth of the medium-size figure, suggests the facial characteristics of the monolithic heads of Easter Island. Another historic reference can be found in the welded bronze and rock crystal piece, ''Votive'' (1987), which looks more like an abstracted bust than a candleholder. Its elegance is akin to the proportions and geometry of Modigliani's sculpture, ''Head'' (1912), which was influenced by the distilled geometry of African Art. ''Votive'' also has a jutting chin and an overshadowing forehead, which again suggests the Easter Island statues.,Mr. Gussow's work, which consists of many pastels and a few oil paintings, proves him to be an accomplished colorist and draftsman. Stylistically, two pastels -- ''The Anatomy of Paddling'' (1996) and ''Kayak Morning'' (1995) -- have the dynamics of Futurism, though a bit more simplified. The repetitive, rhythmic motion, especially in ''The Anatomy of Paddling,'' was commonly found in the paintings of this early 20th-century art movement.  Even the transparency of the forms of works like Giacomo Balla's ''Lines of Allure Plus Dynamic Successions'' (1913) is in both of these Gussow pastels. In ''Kayak Morning,'' he illustrates the navigator's perspective, which adds to the action realized within the composition.,Mr. Gussow's use of appropriation is also apparent in ''Chile Roasting'' (1986), which is akin to the landscape paintings from the 1910's by Wassily  Kandinsky. Another piece, ''Chile Today'' (1995), could pass for an 1980's Matisse-inspired Peter Max. One pastel that defies comparison is ''Crab Trap With Bait'' (1987). It is bluntly narrative: a blue crab takes the bait as an arrow marks the escape route; sinuous brown lines of seaweed lace in and out of the undulating waters, springing open the trap's doors. The individual lines, which define this drama, push it toward a composition that confuses the space, emphasizing nature's ability to foil the trapper's plans.,The oil on linen titled ''Ice Brittle Branches'' (1978) is this show's most resolved piece. Its subject, an unprejudiced depiction of nature's endless possibilities of line and color through the depiction of isolated ice-covered branches, is so unpretentious that it becomes a painter's painting. All of the numerous branches in this 58 1/2-by-66 1/2-inch piece, none of which exceed 10 inches, are different in shape and length and are in yellow ochre, slate blue, gray and sienna. It is possible that Mr. Gussow may have made this work in response to Pattern Painting, which was gaining in popularity at the time the piece was made, though it is more likely that it was created through pure observation, fueled by the joy of painting.,It would have made more sense to have held this show in the warmer months so Mr. Dell's larger pieces  could have been seen outdoors. Despite the unfortunate placement of Mr. Dell's most technologically progressive work, the curator, Carolyn deLisser, should still be commended for mounting the exhibition.,''Yin and Yang: Two Views of the Earth'' can be seen at the Blue Hill Cultural Center in Robert Martin's Blue Hill Plaza through April 31. The  exhibition, which consists of just more than 60 works, is displayed in the Concourse, the Atrium and the Upper Lobbies of Buildings 1 and 2.

"'Material Sensibility',Omni Gallery, 333 Earle Ovington Boulevard, Uniondale. Through March 12. 794-7800.,The material in question is handmade paper, as used by five artists of varying sensibilities. Like clay and plaster, it has a neutral character that allows it to assume many guises and communicate on a number of different levels. Any underlying unity in the show is established by paper's traditional role as a vehicle for written or visual messages, the function it most often serves here.,In Robbin Ami Silverberg's ''64 Stones,'' each element of the multi-part installation contains a fragment of the total story. The so-called stones are metaphors for narrative building blocks, each contributing a vital part of the story's complete structure. Ordinary objects embedded in the square sheets of hand-formed paper suggest meaningful souvenirs. As in a scrapbook, however, their significance is more private than explicit. Mirror shards, locks of hair, slices of toast and spent matches hint at intimate domestic matters, consequential only to the person involved. But anyone who has ever saved such mementoes can relate to the Proustian impulse to unlock the vast warehouse of memory with a small and simple key.,Memories of a different order inhabit Louise McCagg's ''Shrouds,'' a haunting series of wall-mounted manuscripts crowned by a pressed-paper effigy masks. Stained slate gray and inscribed with cryptic writing, the sheets take on the character of tombstones, while the effigies resemble shrunken heads. This somewhat macabre impression heightens the emotional impact of a work that  resists straightforward interpretation because of the illegibility of its inscriptions. Are these spirit-letters from beyond the grave, alien identity documents of some sort, or an archaeological find? The title implies both a memorial purpose and a deliberately obscure meaning.,In ''12 Tied Image,'' Jai-Kwang Rim also uses paper to conceal as much as it reveals. A dozen small bundles have been draped with damp paper, forming impressions of the packages without revealing their contents. The uniform white surface camouflages and neutralizes intriguing items like insects, a tiny baby doll and other details. They recall the castings made from the negative shapes trapped in Pompeii's volcanic ash. Mr. Rim's ''Suspended Tree,'' also of neutral cast paper, resembles another collection of ghostly remnants, this time the husks of branches from a vaporized tree.,Cynthia Thompson's untitled paper castings are vaguely teat-shaped, although they are not literal breasts. These bulbous projections protruding from the wall allude to nursing, an analogy reinforced by a coating of powdered milk. They use abstraction and suggestion to evoke maternal nourishment. In contrast, a group of caplike shapes pinned to the wall look like shriveled teats. Empty except for a dusting of dried milk, they seem to represent the loss of that nurturing influence.,''Construction Zone,'' an installation by Jane Ingram Allen, recon figures the resilient paraphernalia of road work as ephemeral and insubstantial. Hard hats have become brittle shells, and traffic cones are recast as delicate paper forms, displayed with trimmed paper scraps to emphasize their flimsiness. Ms. Allen offers a wry comment on the fragility of protective devices, as well as the way an artist can invest mass-produced, commonplace objects with alternative implications.,'Nandu',Anthony Giordano Gallery, Dowling College, Idle Hour Boulevard, Oakdale. Through April 25. 244-3016.,A large flightless bird related to the ostrich, the nandu is native to South America. In this installation, Rimer Cardillo uses it as a symbol of the consequences of human insensitivity to the environment.,The gallery contains objects and artifacts akin to those found in a traditional 19th-century cabinet of curiosities: a large trophy egg, decorated like a sideshow souvenir; a copy of Ernest Flammarion's treatise ''Living Animals of the World,'' in which methods of hunting the bird are described; a pair of stone bola weights from the throwing weapon used to bring it down, and feather dusters like those made from its plumage. These relics, together with a cast of the bird's leg and leathery strips simulating its hide, imply that the creature has been exploited for its commercial and display value, rather than respected and protected as part of the natural world.,Dominating the installation is a pair of latex castings of nandu carcasses, stuffed to give them bulk and pinned to the wall like scientific specimens. Floating in simulated space, the two birds look almost gruesomely naturalistic, with details of feather and skin textures clearly replicated, and yet otherworldly, representing the spirit of their entire species. Colorless, inanimate, neither flying nor running but apparently trying to do both, they seem poised between the reality of existence and the memory to which extinction will consign them.,In ''Nandu'' Mr. Cardillo has chosen an apt vehicle for his commentary on the conflict between the exotic and the quotidian. In a supplementary display, he has made a grid pattern of imagery featuring butterflies, moths, beetles and other insects, arranged as a wallpaper pattern. This device further emphasizes how society may objectify living things, turning them into trophies, decorations and utilitarian commodities. On his copy of Flammarion's volume, the artist has placed a magnifying lens, inviting the viewer metaphorically to examine more closely the premises that underlie such attitudes.,'The Holocaust Wall Hangings',History Museum, Museums at Stony Brook, 1208 Route 25A, Stony Brook. Through May 2. Hours:,751-0066.,Although Judith Weinshall Liberman was alive during World War II, she was not a victim of Nazi persecution. Her entire immediate family had emigrated from Europe to Palestine in 1921, so they were spared the terror of the Holocaust. Nevertheless, she has felt compelled to examine the subject in her art, first in paintings and, for the last 11 years, in this series of fabric banners. Ms. Liberman offers no pat answers to questions about her motivation. As she points out in a statement accompanying the exhibition, why she has chosen this theme is less important than whether she does it justice.,For this viewer, she certainly has, and without resorting to the all-too-familiar documentary imagery of persecutions and atrocities guaranteed to push the right emotional buttons. Her approach is largely schematic, although it incorporates photographic elements, text and naturalistic motifs. These, however, are subordinated to a larger narrative scheme, in which charts and diagrams reconfigure the Holocaust as a geopolitical phenomenon in which individuals are dehumanized.,Abstraction and repetition are applied to the symbolism of repression, removing it from the realm of personal suffering and elevating it to the level of universal tragedy. A simplified portrait of Anne Frank, running as a leitmotif through much of the series, is the only concession to individualized victimization, but she has become as much a general symbol of injustice as a particular character in the sinister drama.,Ms. Liberman's most effective tool is the map, which not only provides pictorial structure but, as a politically determined construct, also emphasizes the extent of Hitler's territorial ambitions. It also alludes to mappa, the Hebrew word for tablecloth. This ironic reference to common domesticity relates directly to the artist's choice of fabric as a medium, and to the way ordinary lives were destroyed by extraordinary brutality.",HELEN A.

"PABLO PICASSO's engagement with the ancient art of pottery apparently began by chance and continued casually but steadily until it grew into his most consuming artistic commitment of the decade or so after World War II. The resulting body of work totals approximately 3,500 ceramic pieces, made primarily between 1947 and 1957 but extending to the last years before his death, in 1973. Without doubt, it is the most misunderstood and underappreciated phase of his long and varied career, a creative achievement that has remained shrouded from public view for two reasons: a widespread prejudice in the art world against pottery as an artistic medium, and Picasso's unfortunate decision to allow an entrepreneur to flood the market with cheap ''editions'' that bear only a faint resemblance to the originals.,''Picasso: Painter and Sculptor in Clay,'' which opens Wednesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is the first major exhibition of these originals in the United States. Even for those who saw the rare earlier exhibitions in Europe, this show of 175 pieces is the first to benefit from the full cooperation of Picasso's heirs and to draw freely from the vast inventory of the artist's estate. Indeed, Picasso's son Claude and his grandson Bernard Ruiz-Picasso are so devoted to the cause of making these pieces known that they served as curators of the exhibition, along with Simonetta Franquelli and Norman Rosenthal of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, which organized the exhibition, and the London-based Picasso scholar Marilyn McCully. In conjunction with the exhibition, Mr. Ruiz-Picasso is also publishing a volume illustrating 365 pieces.,The Picasso who emerged from World War II was a very different figure from the radical outsider evoked by ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' and Cubism. Picasso's decision to remain in Paris throughout the Occupation and face down the Nazis' condemnation of his art transformed the public conception of him, from that of a leader of rarefied, avant-garde trends to that of a symbol of intellectual resistance to the Nazis and fascism. After Paris was liberated in August 1944, the crowds visiting his studio on the Rue des Grands-Augustins grew so large that Picasso joked to his friend, the photographer Brassai, ''Paris is liberated, but me, I was and I remain besieged.'',As the exhibition ''Picasso and the War Years,'' currently at the Guggenheim Museum, demonstrates, Picasso's art, from ''Guernica'' (1937) through the ''Charnel House'' (1944-45), proclaims his opposition to violence and political repression. And during the following decade he continued to punctuate his work with paintings that responded to contemporary political events, most specifically ''Massacre in Korea'' (1951), and even to participate in peace conferences sponsored by the Communist Party (which he had joined in 1944).,Yet as Picasso's remark to Brassai suggests, he had little patience with public appearances and diplomatic debate. Soon he spent less and less time in Paris and more in the south near Antibes, beside the Mediterranean and close to where he had been born.,The change of locale fired Picasso's imagination. With renewed hope, he drew strength from the pastoral utopias conjured up by Roman artists working along those shores centuries earlier and became fascinated with the medium, pottery, that most fully preserved their art. Speaking of that ancient ambiance, Picasso recounted: ''It's strange. In Paris, I never draw fauns, centaurs or heros from mythology. It's as if they live only here.'',A few miles inland from Antibes, the town of Vallauris had been a center of a booming pottery industry during ancient times. In the 1930's, a growing interest in traditional crafts and the importance of ceramics in Art Deco design had spawned a revival in the area. When Picasso arrived in the summer of 1946, the potteries were on the verge of bankruptcy; yet in only a few years his reinvention of the medium fed a thriving industry of shops and adjoining factories.,As his companion at the time, Francoise Gilot, recalled, Picasso's involvement began as ''almost an anonymous suggestion, dropped on the sand'' in the course of a leisurely day at the beach with friends. On a lark, they visited Madoura, a pottery workshop that had been recommended to them, run by Georges and Suzanne Ramie, where Picasso painted a few plates.,The following summer, Picasso and Gilot stopped by the Ramies' shop to see the results after firing. Even though Picasso wasn't impressed, he made them an offer: ''If you'll give me a workman to help out with the technical side, I'll come back and work seriously.'' The Ramies jumped at the chance, and so began Picasso's reinvention of both the sculptural form and painted surface of traditional pottery, as well as the commercial exploitation of his designs.,From the beginning, Picasso showed a joint ambition -- he wanted both to recall the medium's classical past and to renew the form. He began a long series of ceramics based on Hellenistic Tanagra figures. He self-consciously decorated pots in the style of Roman craftsmen, and he even painted fragments of pottery in imitation of shards unearthed at archeological digs. Emulating Roman and Etruscan models, he often included cameo silhouettes as part of the design. Several of these are actually portraits of himself and Gilot, thereby slyly insinuating a union of ancient and modern.,Gilot was quite knowledgeable about pottery and strongly encouraged Picasso's involvement. Before the 1940's, Picasso had made only a few experiments with clay. But Gilot had learned the basic techniques growing up in the 30's, when artistically inclined girls were encouraged to take up ceramics as a form suitable for cultivated ladies. Ever rebellious, however, Gilot refused to be marginalized; she chose painting instead. So when Picasso threw himself into the medium, neither of them had any intention of treating it as the secondary, decorative form it had become in the Deco period.,As preparation, he made scores of drawings in which he transformed the conventional patterns of plates and pitchers into anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms suggesting human faces, standing women or seated rams, and he consulted with a local chemist to expand the palette of available colors. Whether Picasso used an existing shape, evolved one with the help of a workman or kneaded one with his own hands, the sculptural form of the piece always fit hand in glove with the painted image to define the work's ultimate meaning. A serving platter might become the beaming head of a centaur, a meal of ceramic sausage and eggs or a corrida bursting with the confrontations of a bullfight before a capacity audience.,While Picasso's intricate ceramic forms were difficult to fire, his brilliant color schemes were even far harder to fathom. Unlike normal paints, pottery pigments do not show their true colors until heated in the kiln. When Picasso painted, he worked with a selection of dull grays and had to imagine the hues that would emerge. As Pierre Daix, Picasso's friend and biographer during these years, surmised: ''My impression was that he became enamored of working with ceramics because it forced him to preconceive the final results more totally than ever, to sum up, like playing chess blindfolded. The risk could not avoid eliciting an extraordinary challenging creative tension.'',BY the late 1950's, Picasso had mastered this process to create scenes both of intricate detail and breathtaking austerity. He had extended the size of his pieces from standard dinner plates and pitchers to wall-size murals. Yet throughout this serious redefinition of ceramics as an art form, there is a powerful vein not frequently acknowledged in his comparable transformations of painting, sculpture or printmaking. It is a quirky and sometimes bellowing humor about modern life. Consider, for instance, a curvaceous tan pot of 1961 incised with a few lines and wrapped with two thin strips of chrome yellow paint: bikini!,When free of political responsibilities, the postwar decade was for Picasso a time of tremendous rejuvenation. With Gilot (his partner until 1953), he fathered two children, Claude (born in 1947) and Paloma (in 1949), and lived the simplest, most unaffected life available to the most famous artist of the century. In many ways he achieved a goal he had stated many years before: ''I'd like to live like a poor man with a lot of money.'' And his passion for the dismissed art of pottery was a perfect reflection of this desire to revel in the commonplace.,But his life could not remain simple. Having made the pottery for his own pleasure, Picasso was not concerned that his dealer found that collectors did not share his appreciation of the art and worried that the fragile clay might destroy their investment. To please the Ramies, who had helped him so much, he agreed to authorize editioned copies of some of his pieces, even though Gilot and others warned him that the result would be confusion and the debasement of his own work. Madoura editions flooded the market with inexpensive pieces that Picasso had not overseen.,If the Ramies' promotion of ceramics was crucial to Picasso's exploration of clay, the couple also became matchmakers in his private life. At their workshop, he met a young saleswoman named Jacqueline Roque who succeeded Gilot as his companion and became his wife in 1961.",MICHAEL FITZGERALD,"FEB. 28, 1999",ART / ARCHITECTURE; The Unknown Picasso: A Revolutionary in Clay,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/art-architecture-the-unknown-picasso-a-revolutionary-in-clay.html
"EDWARD HICKS, the early 19th century painter and Quaker minister, is a commanding figure in American folk art. His reputation rests largely on his ''Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings, more than 60 works that bring to life Isaiah's optimistic prophecy for the hereafter. In Hicks's depiction, fierce animals live side by side with tame ones -- a wolf and a lamb, a leopard and a goat, a lion and a calf, a bear and an ox -- all crowded together with small children on a wooded knoll. A Hicks embellishment in the background enlarges the biblical metaphor: William Penn is shown forging a peace treaty with Indians.,Hicks's works, especially his ''Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings, continue to bring top prices in the market: last month a version from 1837 was auctioned at Christie's in New York for $4.7 million, a record for folk art. And people throughout this country recognize the image as quickly as they do the nation's leading art icon, James Abbott McNeil Whistler's ''Mother.'',And yet, says Carolyn J. Weekley, an art historian who is the director of museums at Colonial Williamsburg, most people do not understand what Hicks's ''Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings are all about. Though to some people they may be as endearing or as banal as Hallmark greeting cards, she says they are actually neither. She recalled that she began to wrestle with the meanings of these paintings 20 years ago, when she had questions about the four that are in Williamsburg's collection at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center.,''Things were not what they seemed to be,'' Ms. Weekley said. ''The 'Peaceable Kingdom' paintings were all very different. And I knew there had to be a reason for that. I wondered why Hicks had painted so many in a series that spanned much of his life, from 1816 to 1847. And why were so few truly peaceful -- maybe only 20 percent. Indeed, these were not fuzzy, cuddly little animals.'',Five years ago, Ms. Weekley began her own in-depth study of the paintings, a research project that resulted in ''The Kingdoms of Edward Hicks,'' an exhibition now at the Folk Art Center that runs through Sept. 6, and a scholarly book, published by Abrams. The show, the first museum retrospective devoted to Hicks, presents 80 of his works, including half the ''Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings and other canvasses as well as signs, furniture and memorabilia. It will travel to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.,Viewing so many ''Peaceable Kingdom'' paintings together makes it clear that at the outset Hicks may have wanted to paint images of an ideal life but that he later seemingly abandoned that ambition, 10 years after he started, as trouble began brewing in the Society of Friends. The schism came when conservative Quakers like Hicks and a cousin, Elias Hicks, who was also a minister, urged members to return to the plain, simple life. But the more affluent Quakers who sought a more worldly life refused. Neither Elias with his preaching nor Edward with his paintings were able to repair the rift, which was to divide Quakers for a century.,To Ms. Weekley, Hicks's disenchantment is reflected in the increasingly angry faces of the animals in the paintings completed after 1825. ''Hicks continues to paint the theme in the 1840's,'' she said. ''But the urgency is gone, and these later works become less energetic and more sorrowful.'',Hicks's life has been well documented, mostly in his memoirs, which he wrote from 1843 until his death in 1849 at the age of 69, but also in family letters and two books on the painter and his work. Hicks was born in 1780 into an Anglican family in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. After his mother died and his father, who held Government positions under the Tories and was later a surveyor, suffered financial reversals, he was sent at age 3 to live with David Twining, a Quaker farmer in Newtown, Pa.,AT 13, Hicks was apprenticed to a coach maker who taught him ornamental and sign painting, crafts he used throughout his life. At 35, however, he feared that his work was too decorative for a Quaker, so he gave up painting entirely and took up farming, at which he was a failure.,To feed his family, he returned to his passion, painting, and within a year had produced his first ''Peaceable Kingdom.'' He drew on his skill at lettering, first in the borders and later the banners in his paintings; both decorative techniques disappear in the 1830's. He copied images of animals from lithographs and engravings to compensate for his inadequacy as a draftsman.,Ms. Weekley said that her research might help disprove some long-held assumptions about folk artists. ''We live with this notion that they are simpletons who express no complex thoughts in their paintings,'' she said. ''This idea was advanced by the people who in the 1920's and 30's wrote about folk art as simplistic, supposedly to add charm and mystique to folksy types of works. While this attitude has been changing slowly over the last 20 years, the Hicks research may be the strongest proof of how complex folk art can be.''",RITA REIF,"FEB. 28, 1999","ART / ARCHITECTURE; Lions Sleeping With the Lambs, But Grudgingly",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/art-architecture-lions-sleeping-with-the-lambs-but-grudgingly.html
"RAY JOHNSON perpetrated art that made its recipients work. For 40 years, with the collaboration of the Post Office, he mailed out drawn, collaged and, in later years, photocopied confections concocted from visual puns, Pop Art references, the lives of friends, chance happenings and weird news items. Something was asked of those who encountered his deadpan performances or received his quixotic letters: to focus for a moment, to add something, to decipher the code, to pass it on. The workings of the New York Correspondence School, as his mailings came to be called, were well known to art-world insiders and, after his 1970 ''Ray Johnson New York Correspondence School'' exhibition at the Whitney Museum, to a somewhat wider public. But the extent of his subversive, hilariously conceived, intricately executed collages have only begun to become evident with ''Ray Johnson: Correspondences.'' organized by Donna De Salvo for the Wexner Center for the Arts and on view at the Whitney Museum, through March 21.,The exhibition has brought to Johnson a recognition that eluded him in the life that ended on Jan. 13, 1995, when, at the age of 67, he dived from a Sag Harbor, N.Y., bridge and died, a probable suicide. Two girls noticed, called the police, got no answer and went to the movies. It was the sort of macabre detail that Johnson compiled and transformed in his art. His friends believe his death was his final performance.,Following are remembrances by people who knew Johnson, gathered by Amei Wallach, who begins by offering one of her own.,AMEI WALLACH,  art critic.,Ray Johnson was mugged about the same time Robert Kennedy was assassinated and Andy Warhol was shot. Soon after that, at age 40, he moved out of New York to Locust Valley, N.Y., where I visited him in 1977, in his gray clapboard house with white shutters. The Volkswagen in the front yard had a Shelley Duvall photograph taped to its side window. By then, Johnson, with his shaved head and lashless blue eyes, looked suspiciously like a character in a comic book. He helpfully supplied the name: ''Sluggo in the Nancy comic. Ernie Bushmiller drew the strip.'' Then he stamped my notebook with an Ernie Bushmiller Fan Club stamp. Also a Shelley Duvall Fan Club stamp. And a Paloma Picasso Fan Club stamp.,I never did get upstairs, but just about all that was in the front room was an enormous, loving-hands-at-home work table and new work propped against walls badly in need of paint. On the Masonite floor was a decrepit Oriental rug dominated by an enormous gray paint spot that, Johnson said, had been spilled ''by the ghost of Janis Joplin.'' The back room was stacked precariously with cardboard boxes, hoards of Scotch tape, cans of Lucite wall paint, bottles of Elmer's glue and a four-foot-high tower of New York telephone books. ''It took days to organize it,'' Johnson told me. He hadn't bothered with the kitchen, where newspapers clogged the doorway and half-empty Camel cigarette packs obliterated the counter.,At that point in the mid-1970's, Johnson had taken a hint from the 16th-century Italian painter Arcimboldo and was making punned, doodled, painted and collaged portraits that began with silhouettes he would draw of friends and strangers. He made some of me. ''They're like a fly in the face, not flattering, nor are they insulting,'' he said. ''I've managed at this point to combine the tragic with the comic, the ridiculous with the sublime.'',JAMES ROSENQUIST,  artist.,I was introduced to Bob Rauschenberg through Ray in 1956, and later I met Lenore Tawney and Agnes Martin through Ray. The first time I visited Joseph Cornell, there was Andy Warhol and Ray and Bob Indiana.,Then Ray moved to Locust Valley. He sent me things in the mail to send on to other people, and when they were really beautiful I'd keep them. Usually they were funny, bizarre, very mysterious, beautiful things -- collages. Once he sent me an image of Bill de Kooning's bicycle seat. And he'd say, ''Finish this portrait.'' So I'd finish it, and send it on. Things like that I thought I could understand, it was ironic and deep and funny. It was also a very delicate vision. Ray's work has a different kind of feeling than, say, Roy Lichtenstein's or Andy Warhol's or mine. It was a much more personal, private experience, a discovery kind of thing, not smack dab in your face. He would say, ''This weekend I walked to all the mailboxes in Brooklyn.'' He had probably put things in them. He would do that, it seemed to me, a little bit like Zen: if you think you know something, you realize you don't know it; then, when you realize you don't know anything, something pops into your head and your mind learns something. I miss Ray, because whenever I find something that is really bizarre, I don't have anyone to send it to.,BILL WILSON,  retired professor of English literature who has written extensively on Johnson.,Very few people can accept that Ray killed himself, but he was planning that when I met him in 1956. Ray lived on behalf of religio-philosophic meanings, and he died on behalf of those meanings. He called me from Orient Point at 4 o'clock the day he died -- collect, so the phone call is recorded on my phone bill. He meant his death by drowning as a mailing event. When he sent works of art through the mail to people as gifts, he was describing what he thought were the correct relations among people.,Mail art meant that art should be free. He was able to live without money for his needs, because he thought most needs would be false. When he wrote to Joan Crawford, he was giving her the chance to reply to him as a person. In the art world, fame and money distorted all those relations. I was with him in 1958 when Leo Castelli said, ''When are you going to let me show your collages?'' and Ray turned on his heel. One by one, as the artists he knew became rich and famous, Ray satirized them or tweaked them.  But some of the artists, like Jim Rosenquist, were able to continue like an all-American boy to communicate with Ray. An envelope from Ray was like a haiku, a moment of immediacy and indeterminancy, a particularly vivid moment outside the economy, outside the machinery of our culture. It was free.,ANDREW HOYEM,  poet and publisher, Arion Press.,I was in Texas with the United States Navy; it could have been in 1958 or '59. I had helped with the publication of a book by Paul Reps, a Zen practitioner, who called his books picture poems. My name was in the back of the book with an address, China Lake, California, and the address seemed to charm Ray. He began sending me odd things in the mail. Then I noticed his design on a paperback book of poems by Rimbaud, and that opened a flood of correspondence.,One time he sent me a cardboard box wrapped with twine, and there was sealing tape around it, and I opened it in my office and out poured these carpet sweepings. Later I got involved in a small publishing company, and we had an idea we would publish his work. The book never happened. Ray could be very coy, and it took me a long time to understand that the talking about it, the sending things back and forth, was the thing. There was a literary bent to Ray Johnson, his use of words, his deep involvement in twists and turns of language, and his punning.,CHRISTO AND JEANNE-CLAUDE,  artists.,Jeanne-Claude: We were living in Paris in 1962 and Sidney Janis did an exhibition called ''New Realists'' and invited Christo to show two works. Then we receive a letter from a Mr. Ray Johnson, whom we don't know, saying, ''I have seen your package at the Sidney Janis Gallery and I would really like to buy one.'' So Christo made a package, he took a photograph of the package, then he reopened the package and put the photo inside with a note saying: ''You said you wanted a package. I sent you one. You destroyed it, and so I send you a photograph. Keep it as a souvenir.'',Christo: My letter was written in English or French, I forget, and he incorporated it in some collage that was sold to a collector.,Jeanne-Claude: When we arrived in New York in 1964, we started inviting people to our room at the Chelsea Hotel, and he was one of the very first phone calls we made. I told him, ''We'll have dinner together, but I have to warn you we might not have enough forks; we might have to eat the chicken with our fingers.'' And the day he was supposed to come, a small, long, narrow package arrived and inside were four forks and a note that said, ''Fear Four Forks.'' Then one day Ray was doing a piece about toys, and he asked me what was my favorite toy when I was a little girl, and I answered, I liked to climb trees. He took an empty bottle of Bordeaux wine and put a sticker on it, and he wrote ''Trees'' and a little doodle.,JOHN WILLENBACHER,  artist.,I think the Christos and Ray were made for each other. Both of their art is generous in that they reach out to people. Ray was always illustrating the lives of people he would meet. There was a gallery girl at the Feigen Gallery, where I showed in the 60's -- Ray was showing at Willard. And Ray was asking people to send bows to her at the gallery, because not only did she wear big black bows in her beehive hairdo, which fascinated Ray, but she also had a live-in lover, which was unusual in those days. So this was Ray Johnson's version of her beau.,One of the things I liked about Ray, he was a real scamp. He sent me a reproduction of a photograph of a horse, and he put little names all around the horse's anatomy with little arrows. Robert Indiana got the ass. I was friends with Robert Indiana in those days. But I didn't go to many Correspondence School meetings. A lot of them were very boring. They were like cocktail parties without drinks.,CHUCK CLOSE,  artist.,I have rather strong feelings about the way Ray has been dealt with as a willing outsider. He was an unwilling outsider; he wanted to be an insider desperately. Ray was an artist's artist, and he had many friends and fans who tried for years to interest curators, museums and writers in his work. You don't want death to become a great career move, and dying and becoming famous is one of the worst artist cliches, and basically it doesn't happen. In Ray's case, since his suicide he has become far more interesting to the art-world establishment. Without it, would he be getting all this attention?,We used to talk usually every week. When I told him I was doing an Artist's Choice show at the Modern [''Chuck Close: Head-On/The Modern Portrait,'' 1991], which consisted of portraits by artists in the museum's collection, he was devastated, because he didn't have a portrait in the collection.,So, the first thing he thought about was would the museum buy something? Not likely. Then: what if he got a collector to give something? But the wheels of an institution like the Modern grind very slowly. So Ray, in his perversely subversive way, knew that Clive Philpot, the librarian at the Modern, never threw anything away. And if Ray began to correspond with him, this guy would compulsively log everything in and put it in boxes, which would circumvent the problems of getting into the collection. And Ray would get in through the back door.,So I call up Clive and say: I understand you have some Ray Johnson. So I selected a black-and-white Xerox of a bunny-head drawing, supposedly a portrait of Bill de Kooning but, of course, all the bunnies look exactly alike. I wanted to pick one that stood for Ray's correspondence because it was as correspondence that it got into the museum. It didn't have all the elegance and likableness and the craft that go into Ray's work, because that's not how it got into the Modern. I wanted it to stand out for its difference.,So I selected this 8-by-10-inch Xerox that cost maybe two cents to make and prominently put it into the exhibition next to extraordinarily expensive pictures by van Gogh and Picasso. It was a great triumph for him, and I think the people at the Modern got a kick out of it too.,ARTHUR DANTO,  philosopher, critic.,I think he was the arch-insider, to tell you the truth. He was so involved with so many people who defined an art world at that time. What I think has to be brought out: there is genuinely a gay esthetic in that operation, the fanlike attitude toward movie stars, the prizing of camp sensibilities, and I think he was very widely connected with a lot of people who knew the answers and could see his references and illusions. The Correspondence School was a tremendous breakthrough. It enabled him to make art of the kind he wanted for the people he wanted.,FRANCES BEATTY,  vice president of Richard Feigen & Co.,I met Ray probably 20 years ago, when I was I doing my Ph.D. on Surrealist imagery, so you can imagine how interested I was in him. I lived in this little apartment, and on the wall I had 200 postcards of art from the 19th and 20th century and the Renaissance that I was using to study for my orals.,Ray walked in one night and he named practically every one of them; you knew this was a man who had absorbed all of art history. I joined the Feigen Gallery in 1980, and Richard and I tried for 17 years to do a Ray Johnson show. Ray was totally ambivalent. In the mid-1980's he said, ''I've got it, Frances, we'll have,'' pause, ''Nothing in the show.'' He wanted to be famous, but he realized if he ever was famous, it would be the end of his activity as an artist.,He called me about five days before he died, and he said: ''You know, Frances, I think I'm finished doing this Nothing I'm involved in. I'm going to do Something, and you're going to be able to do the show.'' And he laughed this sweet Ray laugh, and then he jumped off the bridge. It was a complete performance.",,"FEB. 28, 1999","ART / ARCHITECTURE; Dear Friends of Ray, and Audiences of One",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/art-architecture-dear-friends-of-ray-and-audiences-of-one.html
"To the Editor:,Anthony Tommasini writes that to the New York Times critic James Gibbons Huneker, a 1913 performance of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire'' had the ''aura of original depravity, of subtle ugliness, of basest egoism, of hatred and contempt, of cruelty and of the mystic grandiose'' [''He Never Wanted to Hurt Music, Just Help It Evolve,'' Jan. 31].,I am reminded of what the Chicago Daily News critic Michaelo Williams wrote in 1969 about a performance of ''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' by Andy Warhol and The Velvet Underground.

"To the Editor:,A letter writer and Metropolitan Opera subscriber, Barry Garsson, asserts that modern operas like those of Arnold Schoenberg ''are failures.''

By Schoenberg and Janacek no less? Hardly. Mr. Garsson makes the twin mistakes of assuming that his own taste is a universal and that a work of technical or stylistic originality inherently lacks the ability to thrill.,That Schoenberg or Janacek attract considerably smaller audiences than Verdi is a known fact. Is this a surprise to anyone? At the moment, Eugene O'Neill's brilliant, difficult play, ''The Iceman Cometh,'' is about to open on Broadway for a 12-week run. At the same time, Irving Berlin's brilliant, enchanting musical ''Annie Get Your Gun'' is gearing up for an open-ended run. The Met has shown similar awareness in their scheduling of the six performances of Schoenberg's brilliant, difficult masterpiece versus the number of performances allotted to ''Turandot'' and ''Aida,'' to pick two from the standard repertory.,Is the relative size of the potential audience an indication of the artistic validity of either ''The Iceman Cometh'' or ''Moses und Aron''?

"The cost of a movie ticket at Loews, Cineplex Odeon and Sony Theaters in New York City jumped to $9.50 yesterday -- the highest in the nation -- and moviegoers in Manhattan were left to grouse, fume and otherwise voice their pique while commiserating in line to pay up.,''To tell you the truth, it's a little bit crazy,'' Matthew Kehoe, 19, a Hunter College student, said of the new prices posted at the box office of the Loews Village VII at 11th Street and Third Avenue, where he was waiting to see ''200 Cigarettes.'',Like thousands of other patrons confronted with the 3 to 8 percent price increase by Loews Cineplex Entertainment at 425 theaters in 22 states and Canada, Mr. Kehoe briefly debated the alternative -- waiting six months to rent the video -- then plunked down his money.,''They kind of stick it to you because people love to see films,'' Mr. Kehoe said. ''Parents aren't going to say to their kids, we're not going to see this Disney movie because it's too expensive.'',Another patron, Greg Krelenstein, 19, of Marlboro, N.J., a student at New York University, also paid up, but said the new price ''definitely makes you more selective,'' and added: ''It's unfair, especially being in a neighborhood where all the students are. Nobody can afford $9.50 to see one movie.'',His friend, Lindsay Feldman, 18, also an N.Y.U. student, said the higher costs would limit moviegoing for many people. ''Already, I think we're kind of choosy because of the prices,'' she said.,As patrons at Loews Village VII paid, the ticket seller asked each in turn: ''Would you like to make a donation to a needy child?'',No way, was the general reaction.,Prices of undiscounted adult movie tickets in New York City have gone up steadily in the last five years, from $7.50 to $8 in 1994, then to $8.50 in 1996 and $8.75 to $9 in 1997.

"AFTER a judge twice cleared an abortion protester who had been arrested on trespassing charges, the Nassau County Police Department has initiated a policy that allows protesters  access without threat of arrest to the grounds of an abortion clinic in East Garden City.,The policy change, approved by Police Commissioner Donald Kane, came in December after two rulings by  Judge Samuel Levine of Criminal District Court in Hempstead. The first ruling was in June 1998, 11 months after the anti-abortion activist, the Rev. John Murphy of Farmingdale, was arrested and charged with trespassing at 1103 Stewart Avenue, which houses Long Island Gynecological Services and other tenants, including the studios of WLIR radio.,The Roman Catholic priest, sometimes accompanied by a small band of associates, demonstrates several times a week outside the front door of the building, praying the rosary and handing out literature to passersby. Court papers indicate that he has demonstrated as close as 10 feet from the front door of the building.,Before the first arrest, Father Murphy was asked to leave by the building manager and refused. During a non-jury trial, Judge Levine ruled that the building manager did not have the authority to have him removed, and dismissed charges.,Last July, Father Murphy was arrested again at the same location. At that time, according to court papers, the building manager, John Carracciolo, produced a letter from the owner of the property authorizing Mr. Carracciolo to have protesters removed from the property. He asked Father Murphy and his attorney, Laura Yantsos, to leave the property. Father Murphy and Ms. Yantsos refused and both were arrested.,The case again went before Judge Levine, who ruled that both defendants had the right to protest on private property.,''Public or partial public use of the premises, whether under express or implied invitation or permission, carries with it the license to enter,'' Judge Levine ruled. ''The defendant, Father Murphy, did not enter the building, but was on the sidewalk inside the property lines. Accordingly, this court finds that defendant, Father Murphy, did lawfully enter the subject property.'',In an interview, Father Murphy said he was being harassed by county officials, the District Attorney and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre. He said that his arrests were ''plainly and openly political,'' and that the diocese was ''not pro-life. They claim to be pro-life but they are not.'',He added that he would continue to protest at the Stewart Avenue site and elsewehere in the county because ''some people are delighted that we are there. We have spoken to some people who have changed their mind'' about having an abortion.,The police department spokesman, Lieut. Kevin Caslin, said that the department disagreed with Judge Levine's ruling, but added: ''We are not going to beat our heads against the wall. For simple trespass, under the same circumstances, we will not make an arrest.'',He added that the police will still make an arrest if Father Murphy enters the building, or if he goes beyond simple trespass and engages in such actions as disorderly conduct. Lieutenant Caslin also said that the policy applies only to the clinic on Stewart Avenue, one of three abortion clinics in Nassau County, and that the police will continue to make arrests at the other clinics if the owner requests that protesters be removed.,County officials' tolerance of abortion clinics is lukewarm at best. District Attorney Denis Dillon has stated that ''peaceful, non-violent acts which might constitute such offenses as trespass and disorderly conduct are morally justified when done to interfere with and prevent the imminent killing of human life by abortion,'' and recused his office from the Murphy prosecution. By prearrangement, the cases were prosecuted by the Suffolk County District Attorney's office.,Ed Flaherty, the Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney who prosecuted the Murphy case, said his department had no doubt that it had a good case against Father Murphy.,''When we prosecuted the case we believed the definitive action constituted a violation of the penal law, and we are still of the opinion,'' Mr. Flaherty said. ''We would prosecute such a case again.'',Edward Land, an attorney who practices in New York City, read the decision in a law journal and contacted the state Commission on Judicial Conduct, which supervises the state courts, asking for the removal of Judge Levine.,In his letter, Mr. Land wrote that Judge Levine gave Father Murphy ''a right that just does not exist under Federal or New York law -- the right to picket on private property against the owner's wishes.'' He argued that Judge Levine ''improperly created a judicial exemption from this law for the exclusive benefit of Father Murphy by endowing him with special First Amendment rights that do not exist for any other resident of this state.'',Gerald Stern, administrator for the Commission on Judicial Conduct, would not confirm or deny that Judge Levine was being investigated, but said that if there is an inquiry it could take anywhere from a few months to a year. He also said that 85 percent of complaints are dismissed.,Tom Levin, past president of the Nassau County Bar Association, said that he believed that the policy of the police department should not have been changed because of Judge Levine's decisions. He said that Judge Levine ruled that ''what happened at that time at that day was not trespassing. Another judge may get another result. It does not mean you can't have a successful prosecution in the future at the same place.'',Commissioner Kane and other senior police officials would not comment on the case.,Judge Levine said he was unaware of the petition to have him removed from the bench. ''The decision speaks for itself,'' he said of the Murphy ruling. ''There is an appeal court to deal with these cases.'',But Mr. Flaherty said that ''because this was a criminal case, and the defendant was found not guilty, it legally cannot be appealed'' because of the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. ''We have no place to go,'' he said.,Jeanne Bezco, executive vice president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, said she was concerned by the case.,''With the amount of instances happening and increasing around the United States, specifically Dr. Slepian's murder in upstate New York, it is clear that we need to increase protection around abortion clinics,'' she said, referring to Barnett Slepian, an abortion doctor who was shot to death in October. ''Our bottom line is that no one should be harassed when they go into a medical facility.'',Long Island Gynecological Services refused to comment on whether Father Murphy had been harassing its patients. Other tenants also refused to comment, but Gary Hisiger, an attorney for 1103 Stewart Avenue Associates, said that ''the landlord has a right to work with the police department and receive the protection that all landlords and clinics receive.'',While Father Murphy is an ordained priest, he belongs to a religious order that is not active in New York State. The chancellor of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, Msgr. Francis J. Schneider said that Father Murphy is not a member of the diocese and is not able to ''exercise public ministry in Nassau County. He is also not authorized by Bishop McGann to speak out in the name of the diocese.'' John McGann is the bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, which encompasses Nassau and Suffolk Counties.,Monsignor Schneider said that Father Murphy's history included violent incidents. Neither he nor the police would elaborate, but Monsignor Schneider said that the Roman Catholic Church ''does not condone acts of violence for any reason.'' He added that while ''the church is in favor of exercising the right to speak out about our own beliefs, if we were asked to leave, we would leave.'',Monsignor Schneider said that Father Murphy was showing ''disrespect of the church and civil authority. I think it is very sad. It is confusing that he is acting independently. He does not represent the church. He is not helping the cause.'' He characterized Father Murphy's actions as ''disobedience and breaking the law of the church.'',Father Murphy wears clerical attire when he demonstrates, as is his right as an ordained priest. But the Very Rev. Domingo Rodriguez of the Missionary Servants of the Most Holy Trinity, Father Murphy's Virginia-based order, said that because of complaints by the Diocese of Rockville Centre he has asked the Vatican to suspend Father Murphy from the priesthood.,''I cannot dismiss him,'' Father Rodriguez said, adding that Father Murphy has not been an active part of the order for 30 years and that he is waiting for a decision from the Vatican on what action to take.,Father Murphy accused Bishop McGann of encouraging the police to harass him. ''The bishop is against us being there,'' the priest said. ''They will not support me. People have the idea that the bishop is pro-life. He is the biggest anti-pro-life one. That is why the police don't mind arresting me.'',''There has been a history of the Nassau County Police Department arresting myself and others completely unlawfully,'' Father Murphy said. ''Gulotta and Dillon and the politicians want us arrested. They are pro-abortion and not pro-life. So, we get it from both sides. They keep arresting us at the behest of the pro-abortion people.''",SHELLY FEUER DOMASH,"FEB. 28, 1999",Anti-Abortion Activist Wins a Round,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/anti-abortion-activist-wins-a-round.html
"As the New York Police Department launches its largest-ever recruitment drive aimed specifically at city residents, national experts say there is no evidence that having officers live where they work makes any difference in the quality of policing.,The $10 million to $15 million recruitment drive announced last week by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir is intended to help diversify the police force, which is more than two-thirds white, in the aftermath of the fatal Feb. 4 shooting of an unarmed West African street vendor by four white police officers.,Though two of the officers involved in the shooting live in the city, the incident has revived calls for a residency requirement among politicians and community advocates who believe it reflects a police mindset of foreigners invading unfamiliar minority neighborhoods.,Mayor Giuliani and Mr. Safir both oppose mandatory city residency for police officers, which would require a change in state law, but said last week they would like to increase the number of New Yorkers on the force. In addition to intensified recruiting, they said, they will soon give city residents extra points on promotional exams and will pursue plans to provide low-interest mortgages or even cash grants for down payments to lure officers into the five boroughs.,New figures released by the department this week show that the percentage of New York officers living in the city has dropped in the last decade, to 54 percent from 60 percent. And, supporting the argument that hiring more city residents would help diversify the force, those figures show that less than half the white officers, 43 percent, live in the five boroughs, while 78 percent of both black and Asian-American officers, and 73 percent of Hispanic officers, do.,''You want a police department that's reflective of the people that they're policing,'' said Norman Siegel of the New York Civil Liberties Union, a leading advocate of residency requirements as part of an affirmative-action plan for the department. ''There's a greater possibility that people who not only live in the city but live in a particular neighborhood will understand the particular people in that community.'',But even as he announced the new drive, Mr. Safir said he would not favor city residents for top department posts. He pointed out that officers living in the city have a higher rate of misconduct than those in the suburbs.,Policing experts say the trend toward requiring officers to live where they work, or giving them financial incentives to do so, is more about image than substantive impact.,''It's a cheap solution that's based on stereotypes,'' said Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.,Gil Kerlikowske, deputy director of the Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Service, agreed, saying, ''There is nothing that I know of that supports the idea that a police officer living in the city versus living outside the city provides better service, is more caring.'',Residency requirements for city workers date to the 19th century, and about 25 percent of municipal police departments with more than 100 officers currently require them to live within the city limits, according to the Justice Department. Another 40 percent of departments require officers to live within a certain radius of the city. New York, for example, allows officers to choose between the five boroughs and six nearby suburban counties in New York State.,Alongside the continuing debate, over residency requirements, the last decade has seen a boom in government incentives for officers to live in the cities they patrol -- particularly in distressed, crime-ridden neighborhoods -- such as cheap or even free housing and take-home patrol cars.,In New York, a nascent program providing subsidies for officers living in housing projects has attracted just 46 people, little more than a tenth of a percent of the force.,Mr. Safir's policy of giving city residents extra points on the police entrance exam has helped boost the level of recruits from the five boroughs to 69.6 percent of a 1998 class, from 62.4 percent of a 1993 class, a department spokesman said.,Of the total force, the largest group, 30 percent, live on Long Island; of those in the city, more than half live in Queens and Staten Island.,''It's like we're Palestinians and they're Israelis, coming over every day to the West Bank,'' said DeShawnta Johnson, a young African-American woman from Brooklyn who described the Police Department as ''an occupation force'' patrolling a mostly minority city.,Of New York's nearly 40,000 officers, 67.4 percent are white, 13.5 percent black, 17.5 percent Hispanic, 1.5 percent Asian-American and the tiny remainder American Indian, department figures show. In 1997, the city population was 38.5 percent white, 26.6 percent Hispanic, 26.2 percent black, and 8.7 percent Asian-American.,The Diallo shooting has intensified calls for a residency requirement, and was the catalyst for unveiling the new residency initiatives, Mr. Safir said.,Of the four officers who fired 41 bullets at Mr. Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment, two live on Long Island, one in Brooklyn and one in Queens.,''Certainly the Diallo shooting raised our consciousness,'' Mr. Safir said. ''As we recruit more city residents, the department will more adequately reflect the city.'',There are no studies comparing residency levels in police departments across the nation. In 1994, 83 percent of the Los Angeles Police Department lived outside the city.,In Seattle, it was about one in three that year, up from 25 percent in 1986. Several large cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston, require all city workers, including police officers, to reside within their borders, laws that were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1976.,New York City passed a law in 1986 requiring city workers to live in the five boroughs, but the police are exempt, along with other uniformed personnel, educators and about 100 other professional job categories.,Residency rules are popular not only to improve police-community relations, but also as a way for cities to hold on to tax dollars.,But policing experts and officials of the local police union, the Patrolman's Benevolent Association, said that many officers cannot afford to live in New York, prefer suburban schools for their children, and often want to put distance between themselves and a stressful job.,''Police officers, in my experience, try to get as far away as they can,'' said Wesley Skogan, a political scientist at Northwestern University who specializes in community policing. ''Partly because it's cheaper, but they also want to get away from their work, they want to keep their families away, for fear of retribution.'',But government agencies continue to try to lure police officers into troubled neighborhoods as part of a community policing strategy. In addition to ad hoc programs in cities around the country, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has the ''Officer Next Door'' program, in which police officers can buy HUD properties for half their market value.,So far, 2,284 officers nationwide have bought HUD homes through the program, according to a spokesman, and 1,889 more are available. In New York, 24 officers are in the process of buying homes from the Federal agency, and another 17 properties are available, a spokesman said.,Mr. Safir said he was talking with various financial institutions about providing low-income loans for officers, and also considering having the department provide the down payment.,While union officials said they would welcome such incentives, policing experts questioned whether it was the wisest use of the money. Stipends for officers who speak a foreign language, or cultural diversity training, might be more efficient paths to improving community relations, they suggested.,But John Timoney, who left the New York Police Department after 29 years and is now Police Commissioner in Philadelphia, which requires officers to live in the city, said residency does make a difference, if only in the public's perception of the department.,Mr. Timoney said that in dozens of community meetings in his new city, he has never heard the police described as ''an occupation force,'' a refrain he heard often in New York.,''There seems to be more support for the police here on a personal level; everybody seems to know a cop somewhere, or know someone who knows a cop, because they live in the neighborhoods,'' Mr. Timoney said in an interview. ''Clearly, they have a bigger stake in the city. Their own survival, their kids' survival, depends on it. Whether that makes them better cops, I'm not sure you can make that quantum leap.''",JODI WILGOREN,"FEB. 28, 1999","After Diallo Shooting, New Focus on Hiring City Residents for Police",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/after-diallo-shooting-new-focus-on-hiring-city-residents-for-police.html

"THE PECULIAR MEMORIES OF THOMAS PENMAN,By Bruce Robinson.,278 pp. Woodstock, N.Y.:,Overlook Press. $24.95.,BRUCE Robinson has written and directed many films, most famously ''Withnail and I.'' Those who reveled in that louche black comedy about a pair of hard-drinking actors down on their luck will find much to enjoy in his wildly funny first novel, ''The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman.'' Those who have reservations, however, about gross, robust humor of the Rabelaisian variety -- and scatology in particular -- should steer clear.,Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary defines ''scatology'' as ''1: interest in or treatment of obscene matters, esp. in literature; 2: the biologically oriented study of excrement.'' Certainly there is literary treatment of obscene matters here, and excrement does play a part in it all -- as do sex, food, cigarettes, pornography and cruelty to crabs -- but its presence is by no means gratuitous. It functions, rather, as the expression of a nonverbal reaction to stress. As such, it carries considerable significance in the delineation of the dynamic of a certain sort of English family, circa 1958. It also produces some hilarious jokes -- schoolboy humor, to be sure, but then this is a novel about a schoolboy.,Thomas Penman is a 13-year-old asthmatic with ''big ears and an unwholesome characteristic.'' He lives with his eccentric family in a large, dilapidated house in a seaside town in Kent. Of all the adults in the household, Walter, his grandfather, is the only one with whom Thomas has any sort of sympathetic relationship. Sadly, though, just as Thomas is preparing to enter life, his grandfather is about to leave it: ''Walter was extremely old and full of cancer, although they hadn't diagnosed it yet. On the day the first cell divided the boy got his first pubic hair. The hair was unimpressive and the cancer just a few miscreant spores in the old man's gut. No one knew anything about either.'',One of the most attractive aspects of the book is Robinson's ability to sustain this sort of tone -- rude and jaunty, spiced with dark glee about the anarchic tendencies of the human body -- and yet to pick out, with a most delicate touch, a set of rounded and plausible figures and relationships within his heavy impasto. At times, particularly in the sections dealing with awakening adolescent sexuality, he is positively lyrical, and manages the difficult feat of articulating the erotic feelings and behavior of very young people without becoming mawkish or risible.,The first chapter is an extended elaboration of Thomas's ''unwholesome characteristic.'' It introduces us both to the broad streak of inchoate rebelliousness in Thomas and to the girl of his dreams: ''One afternoon he was out drowning flies when he realized he was in love with Gwen Hackett. She was at the same school, half a year younger, but already with a well-filled bra. It wasn't until he was in love with her that he realized everybody else was. Gwendolin was beautiful, stone blond with sexy teeth, lips like the bit after a knot in a balloon.'' Gwendolin will provide the love interest in this coming-of-age novel. When that love is finally consummated, Thomas knows ecstasy. But hard upon its heels comes tragedy. It is an experience of dashed hopes and unbearable loss that mirrors with uncanny precision what his grandfather went through in World War I. This parallel arc forms one of the two structural braces that somehow contain the boisterous centrifugal energies of this baggy novel.,The other is Thomas's nagging uncertainty about who he really is. For despite its wealth of digressions and its uninhibited indulgence of its own earthy humor, the novel has at its heart an identity quest -- and before that quest can be completed, a dark family secret must be revealed. ''When you're out hunting secrets, Tom,'' Walter tells our hero, ''make sure you go after the right one.'',Thomas Penman is a boy who is perpetually after secrets, and his is a household awash in them. Of all the various bonds that hold the family together, love is not the strongest. Rage, guilt, anger, concealment and resentment fuel several relationships in the untidy Penman household, and here again it is Robinson's pleasure -- and ours -- to view such dysfunctionality with a hopelessly incorrect irreverence.,But we come to understand that this is no Aunt Sally of a family he has set up for the mere pleasure of knocking down. Thomas's attempt to answer every adolescent's most pressing question -- who am I? -- is very much pertinent to a mystery that, when he solves it late in the book, explains why these people take such grim satisfaction in annoying, ignoring and abusing one another.,THE main generator of all this nastiness is Thomas's father. Rob Penman is a glorious comic creation. His politics say much about him. ''In Rob's lexicon of jurisprudence capital offenses were myriad: you could get hanged for almost anything, hanged for vegetarianism. Endless streams tramped to Rob's scaffold, Communists, trade unionists, the Labor Party -- he hanged the lot of them, and it wasn't even 7 A.M.'' You might call him a hanging kind of man, or you might just call him a conservative. Rob's relationship with his long-suffering wife, Mabs, is going through a particularly tough phase, for he has started an affair with a woman called Ruby. Mabs is punishing him by feeding him vast quantities of roast meat and failing to clean up the messes made by her many dogs. This is a good example of Robinson's deployment of an excremental communication system in a situation of familial stress.,Much of this will cut very close to the bone for those who grew up in England in the 1950's. The ability of members of English families of that period not to speak honestly to one another about anything of any importance is now legendary. For the child of a family like this, the home, far from being a haven, would be a place of secrecy and confusion, and he or she might well cry out for light and clarity and, above all, answers. Such a child is Thomas Penman.,But little pathos attaches to Thomas as he worries at the impenetrable mysteries aroused by his weird family. Like all red-blooded English schoolboys, he has discovered various healthy outlets for the anxieties of childhood -- in his case, explosives, cigarettes and pornography. This last is a particularly fertile hobby, as Thomas knows that his grandfather possesses a vast collection of such materials, which he keeps in a pair of filing cabinets under lock and key. Thomas, in his endless snooping and lurking about the house, makes frequent but unavailing efforts to find that key, and thus get at the forbidden fruit within the filing cabinets.,Old Walter knows that Thomas is after his pornography, and this, in part, is the reason for his advice to the boy, that in his hunting of secrets he should ''make sure you go after the right one.'' The relationship of these two, grandfather and grandson, is one of the few solid things in Thomas's shaky existence, and here again nonverbal communication comes into play. But this time it is in the form of electrical rather than biological discharges. Thomas and Walter transmit messages to each other by Morse code, Walter having been a brilliant Morse code operator in World War I, before suffering the appalling injuries (described here with some relish) that left him praying for death behind enemy lines. In the midst of his prayers, he remembered his recent, brief and glorious affair with a girl called Ad le. This memory underpins his enlightened advice to Thomas with regard to the lovely Gwendolin.,ANOTHER character in the novel who, when all the strings have been pulled tight, will be seen to have had a major impact on Thomas's fate is his best friend, Maurice Potts. Maurice is teaching Thomas how to smoke and also how to drink, and a session of debauchery in their secret den -- a place called Head of an Angel Hole, at the derelict end of a graveyard -- is a deeply funny and entirely credible picture of two teen-age boys talking about the things that really matter to them. Robinson does not flinch from showing us the full grimy awfulness of schoolboys' sexual fantasies; and it is in regard to these fantasies -- in tandem with some incriminating text and photographs -- that Maurice's subsequent betrayal of Thomas to the grown-ups will bring about a momentous event that catapults Thomas toward adulthood.,Another of those events comes by way of a fortuneteller called Madame Olanda. ''Olanda worked her Ball in a shack on the seafront next door to a fish fryer and it cost five shillings to get in. . . . She wore a turban and drank too much and her face was the color of a brick. . . . She resided alone, spending most of her life in darkness, like a tongue.'' As this passage again demonstrates, Bruce Robinson is a master of the vivid organic simile. It also shows the deftness with which he can bring to life characters who were a familiar part of the English social landscape of that period. In his hands, they are no mere caricatures. Madame Olanda, archenemy of Rob and (in one extraordinary scene) the destroyer of his windshield, will emerge as an old friend of Walter and an ally of Thomas in his quest. As all good fortunetellers should, she throws light on a deep mystery, one that Thomas spends a good part of the book attempting to penetrate.,There is much else in this teeming novel that cries out for applause, including a host of minor characters like Norris, the ghastly algebra teacher, who rhetorically asks Thomas, when the boy tries to escape a sticky situation in class by going to the washroom: ''Do you think I can pay my mortgage in a lavatory? . . . We'd never have won the war in the lavatory!'',Robinson's characters are set against the backdrop of an England of 40 years ago, vividly evoked in all its grayness, smelliness and mediocrity. There is unflagging comic invention throughout, but the serious theme running beneath it all is that of the insecurity of adolescence, specifically one pubescent boy's bewilderment about sex, illness, marriage, death and love, and his attempt to make some sort of sense of his life without adequate information or experience. Never before has the painful, knotty journey to maturity been depicted with such gusto, and never has the venerable Bildungsroman received such riotously profane treatment.",PATRICK MCGRATH,"FEB. 28, 1999",Accentuate the Negative,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/books/accentuate-the-negative.html
"BACK in the 60's, when $50,000 bought a ''nice home'' in Westchester, selling houses was often a part-time, pin-money job for women who thought of themselves primarily as housewives and mothers.,Flash forward: those who succeed in today's fast-paced, competitive real estate market are most likely high earners -- entrepreneurs armed with an array of skills and marketing techniques unheard of a generation ago.,Everyone in the real estate business now needs to know how to make the best use of computers, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors in White Plains.,''Which is why, as a business association, we are taking a major role in teaching our members how to use the technology that is all important in marketing today,'' Mr. Mercurio said. ''Education has become a big thing for us. We hold seminars at our office. We also put out a lot of information on our Web site that helps our members.'',Because the stakes are high, the competition is keen. ''Getting into the business is still relatively easy, but being successful is something else,'' said Peggy Doepper, president and chief operating officer of Coldwell Banker of Connecticut and Westchester. ''One important trait the successful have in common is inner drive. They are self-starters.'',She continued: ''The top producers in our 13 Westchester offices not only have computer proficiency, but many are fluent in a foreign languages. They all have sophisticated marketing skills and the ability to handle the entire transaction from the negotiations to inspections and mortgage arrangements.'',Citing some of the vast changes occurring since the early 80's, Ms. Doepper said: ''Sixteen years ago when I started in real estate, no technology was involved. And personal marketing was unheard of. You never had your name on a sign or in an ad. By contrast, today our most successful agents are entrepreneurs, willing to take risks, who run businesses within a business.'',And they buy what the business needs, Mark Seiden, a salesman in Coldwell Banker's Briarcliff Manor office, said. He estimated that he spent $20,000 of his own money to buy his tools, which include a laptop computer, a color copier, a printer and a fax for a second office he has in his home. Besides the listings he has on the Coldwell Banker Web site, www.coldwellbanker.com (the national web site), Mr. Seiden has listings on his own Web page, which is www.homeman.net.,What is more, as the company's first agent in Westchester to use  virtual reality to market homes on the Internet, Mr. Seiden paid the Paladin Group in Stamford $300 for each of five listings, priced from $459,000 to $1.5 million. The Paladin Group does the photography and produces the virtual reality home tours.  When Mr. Seiden was asked how he found a company to produce virtual tours, he said: ''It wasn't easy. Very few brokers do this. But I go to a lot of marketing seminars and seminars in advanced realtor technology. I  take advantage of everything out there.,''The virtual reality house tour gives prospective home buyers a 360-degree walk-through viewing of a house without having to leave their computer. For instance, during a typical cyberspace tour, a buyer can stand in the middle of a room, slowly turn around, look up at a skylight, down at a parquet floor and then go out and look up and down the street.'',Seven days after his virtual reality listings appeared on the Web, Mr. Seiden said he accepted a binder for a house in Armonk. He now has binders for all five houses that appeared on the Web from customers in Manhattan, a family relocating from Minneapolis and another executive in Laguna Hills, Calif.,''Virtual tours have proved to be a terrific marketing tool,'' he said. ''I plan to do about four a month to appear on the Internet.'' No figures are yet available on the number of houses sold using the virtual reality technique.,Mr. Seiden said that last year was his best to date, and that during the year he completed 75 transactions with an aggregate value of more than $25 million.,Marcia Stauber, an associate broker in Coldwell Banker's office in Katonah, is preparing to use virtual reality to market her home listings. Ms. Stauber maintains a home office and employs a full-time assistant,  who is a licensed real estate agent.,''I consider myself an entrepreneur who runs a business,'' she said.  ''You have to expand and build a reputation, otherwise why would clients list with you? I believe in a lot of marketing. Very often I advertise, paying for my own ads. I also advertise my listings via slides in seven movie houses in Bedford and Mount Kisco. I have a big overhead, but it's all part of doing business.'' Last year was the best year she has had in the 15 years she has been in real estate,  she said.,Ms. Stauber, who is fluent in French, is also one of more than 60 bilingual sales associates in Coldwell banker's offices in Westchester and Rockland. ''I visit France about four or five times a year, and when I'm there I stop in the local real estate agencies in even the smallest towns and establish a contact,'' she said. ''I also maintain two Web sites, one in English and one in French.'',Coldwell Banker has added a new section to its Web site,  www.nymetrocoldwellbanker.com,  clicking on ''foreign language directory'' for a listing of the languages its bilingual sales associates speak. Their second languages include Cantonese, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Pakistani, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog and Yiddish.,In the Bedford office, one person, Lucille Liang, not only speaks standard Chinese but also Mandarin and several dialects, including Shanghiaise and Szechuanise.,Ms. Liang, a native of Taiwan, came to the United States to go to graduate school. ''I've been an editor, the owner of a cooking school and, when in 1990 I lost my lease, I became a broker,'' she said. ''I'm very aware that you need sophisticated marketing and computer skills to succeed today. I take advantage of advanced technology and am planning to have my own virtual reality listings very soon.'',Although Ms. Liang gets referrals from Chinese residents in the county,  she said that only 10 percent of her clients are Chinese. ''The majority are American and European,'' she said. ''My three Web sites generate business for me in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, but most of those who E-mail me are American or Europeans who live there.'' She added that she believed sales through the Internet would continue to grow at a very fast pace.,''For instance, a Russian scientist in San Diego saw my site and contacted me because he was being transferred to New York. When he arrived, I showed him a property in Armonk and he bought it. I predict that more and more properties will be sold on the Internet this year.,The largest independent real estate concern dealing in residential properties is Houlihan/Lawrence, based in Bronxville. They, too, are using the latest technology.,Stephen R. Meyers, president of Houlihan/Lawrence, said: ''We are the largest independent residential realtors in the county, with 22 offices in Westchester and Putnam and 550 sales associates. Our hundreds of listings on the Internet generate business for us all over the world. As yet we do not offer virtual reality house tours, but we are looking into it. We do have exterior photos of each listing.'',Mr. Meyers added: ''Several Houlihan/Lawrence brokers do have personal assistants. Most are licensed, and the personal assistants are paid by the brokers who hire them. Many of our brokers are fluent in several languages. It is not unknown for one of our successful brokers to earn several hundred thousand dollars a year.''

"Call it Monica Inc. From the New York base of this sprawling global concern, sales are still being tallied for its complete line of pay-for-angst products.,Singapore and Israeli television stations have made investments and await shrink-wrapped, tamper-proof videotapes of a 50-minute interview with Monica S. Lewinsky, which will be delivered by special couriers only to registered recipients.,French television has scornfully passed up the opportunity for a video confessional, but the magazine Paris Match has bought first serial rights to publish an excerpt from Ms. Lewinsky's coming book of woe, ''Monica's Story'' (St. Martin's Press, $24.95), that comes with a bonus interview with Ms. Lewinsky.,Publications like the British gossip magazine Hello have paid for vivid color photo spreads of Ms. Lewinsky that include a pensive portrait of her, nestled on a striped, overstuffed sofa with downcast eyes, a basket of yarn below her, knitting.,But there's nothing knit-and-purl about the furious pace of business swirling about Ms. Lewinsky, whose advisers have even considered an Internet chat site about her that would seek advertising. As the dates approach this week for ABC's two-hour interview and the publication of a book about her travails, other related deals are still being counted.,For investors in this venture, though, the critical question remains: Just how keen is consumer demand for more Monica?,The new book, written by the biographer of Diana, Princess of Wales, Andrew Morton, with the cooperation of Ms. Lewinsky, portrays her as a troubled young woman and a pawn of Washington power struggles.,But with its coming publication, Ms. Lewinsky moves now to the center of competing financial interests -- television networks anxious to promote exclusive interviews, book publishers intent on protecting the mystery of their information until publication, and a retinue of handlers concerned with financial security and shaping an image.,Thus far her expanding group of advisers has devised a double-barreled campaign to promote Ms. Lewinsky's interests here and in foreign countries. On the home front, the vision is a stately ''less is more'' civilian version of a Rose Garden strategy that will present Ms. Lewinsky to potential readers through two interviews -- with the ABC correspondent Barbara Walters on ''20/ 20'' and Time magazine.,Eschewing the traditional American book-tour circuit of autograph signings and chain-store appearances, Ms. Lewinsky will leave it to the book's author, Mr. Morton, to stand in for her. And for a simple reason: He is able to speak -- and raise criticism about the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr -- without the restrictions her immunity agreement imposes on her.,Once she shows her passport, though, Ms. Lewinsky will switch to the more grinding role of celebrity promoter. She is not expected to be as aloof in countries where many major publications have paid a price for rights to publish excerpts of her book and, by standard practice, are entitled to interviews with her.,The divergent strategies may present some delicate problems for the American publisher, St. Martin's Press. To attract a large core of readers, particularly women, it must shape a sympathetic image of Ms. Lewinsky, guarding against appearances that she is unduly profiting from the scandal.,At the same time, overseas is rich with opportunity: Foreign news publications generally pay higher prices for serial rights, but her handlers believe that the book will require more promotional activity.,Interviews, for instance, are already planned with some buyers like Paris Match, The Daily Mirror in London, New Age in Australia and Corriere della Sera in Italy. In Germany, the newspaper Bild has excerpt and interview rights; the speculation in publishing circles is that the paper and its sister publishing company, Ullstein, paid as much as $200,000 for them.,In Britain, where Michael O'Mara Books is publishing ''Monica's Story'' on Friday, Ms. Lewinsky will make nearly a dozen appearances in large cities, visiting local book shops, signing autographs and participating in radio interviews. She has already been photographed for the British fashion magazine Marie Claire, which is planning on using the material for a cover. Hello published a paid interview with Ms. Lewinsky's father, Bernard Lewinsky, that included pages of photographs of Ms. Lewinsky posing among the blooms in a friend's garden and huddled in a wicker chair.,But in the United States, ''our strategy is distance and dignity,'' said Lynn Goldberg, who is managing public relations for Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Morton.,''Although she hasn't been able to speak for a year, the American perspective is that she's really been around and we really want to sell books,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ''It's a common publicity question to deal with if somebody is so overexposed. If you really want to know how Monica feels, you need to read the book. It makes the book the essential document for closure.'',Even so, some American publishers consider it a potential problem for the book that ABC decided to expand its program on Ms. Lewinsky; it may leave very few surprises to prompt potential readers to pay up to $24.95 for the book.,ABC, though, clearly believes that plenty of viewers want to see more of Monica Lewinsky. Last week it sought advertising rates of $800,000 for a 30-second commercial on the broadcast, which is scheduled for Wednesday. That is less than the $1 million the network is charging for spots on its Academy Awards show, but it is five times the rate it would normally charge for ''20/20.'',And if that isn't enough, potential readers in the rest of the world will be able to see the British interview with Ms. Lewinsky conducted by the Channel Four anchor Jon Snow, a program that will also be broadcast this week in Britain.,Channel Four paid more than $600,000 for the interview, but the company has already made that money back with sales of rights to broadcast the interview in more than 25 countries, according to R. Bernard Macleod, the managing director of Channel Four International. He added that talks were continuing with other television stations interested in the program.,Jack Romanos, the president of Simon & Schuster, said he was not sure just how much success the book might enjoy because ''it largely depends on how much Monica Lewinsky gives away for free as a result of the Barbara Walters interview.'',''After two hours of Monica, I wonder if there will be anything left or if anybody will care more,'' he said. ''But I've always said that the book will probably make a best-seller list for a week or two.'',Simon & Schuster, which published Mr. Morton's successful biography of Diana, met with Mr. Morton and Ms. Lewinsky last year to consider their book proposal. Mr. Romanos said that he was impressed then with Ms. Lewinsky, whom he described as a likable young woman who could be a next-door neighbor.,''The problem was that we just weren't hearing the information that we needed to hear,'' Mr. Romanos said. ''I just didn't think that she was going to come across as sympathetic, to overcome that problem that it's hard to draw an audience, particularly of women, who want to run out and read about somebody's affair with a married man.'',To shape her image and promotion, Ms. Lewinsky is being aided by a retinue of advisers, giving the effort more the gravitas of a political campaign than of a book tour.,Not only does she get the attentions of the publicity department at St. Martin's Press, but also the counsel of Ms. Goldberg, a longtime publishing professional whom St. Martin's hired for the project. Additionally, John Scanlon, a media consultant whose clients have ranged from CBS and Brown & Williamson to Ivana Trump during her divorce from Donald Trump, was recently retained by the Lewinsky family.,These advisers sum up their  American strategy in words that sound like preparations for a charity ball -- dignity, simplicity, elegance.,Michael O'Mara, the London publisher who helped assemble the entire project, remains unworried that Ms. Lewinsky's status as ''the other woman'' will dampen book sales.,At last count earlier this month, he had sold the rights to publish the book in almost a dozen countries; last week, he was still selling rights to serialize it.,''We think this will be popular,'' he said. ''I've known this from the very beginning when we were told by very intelligent people in New York that there was no market for Monica -- she's the other woman, Americans don't like that. But I was talking to people in the street and I was hearing a completely different story and they were much more sympathetic to her than the intelligentsia.'',The Starr report outlining the scandalous affair with President Clinton flopped as a book in Europe. Still, Mr. O'Mara contends, readers will be interested in the book because it explores Ms. Lewinsky's struggle with the independent counsel or, as Mr. O'Mara prefers to refer to his villain, ''the grand inquisitor.'',Mr. O'Mara declined to estimate how much Ms. Lewinsky could make on foreign book sales. St. Martin's Press paid a $600,000 advance for the rights to publish in North America, with bonuses tied to best-seller rankings. But that does not include Ms. Lewinsky's advance in Britain or royalties from other nations.,Most lucrative, perhaps, are the sales of her television interview through Channel Four International in Britain; according to several sources, it is giving more than 70 percent of the revenue from those sales to Ms. Lewinsky.,Mr. Macleod of Channel Four declined to say how much the interviews are being sold for, noting that the price varies by country. Estimates range from $100,000 to $500,000, depending on the market; if so, Ms. Lewinsky stands to make several million dollars.,''I know exactly how much she is going to be making, down to the penny,'' Mr. Macleod said.

"IT may well be one of the last egalitarian sports around. ''Right now we have a librarian, a C.E.O., a piano teacher and a president of a bank playing on the same team,'' said Carleton Cleveland, president of lower Connecticut's Nutmeg Curling Club. ''There's no social tag associated with it.'',For recent arrivals to Fairfield County from Wisconsin, the country's capital of curling, Tracy and Brian Lawless (who have been curling since childhood) found a home on the ice and an opportunity to meet new people apart from the corporate culture.,''Part of the appeal of this sport is that there are no real professional  curlers,'' said Peter F. Murphy, the president of the Ardsley Curling Club, where the Nutmeg Curling Club has a temporary home. ''We could all be contenders.'',But there are serious contenders like 16-year old Lesley Reiter of Darien, who curls across the country in junior national competitions.,Curling -- part boccie and part bowling -- has its roots in 16th-century Scotland, where rocks formed by nature were thrown across frozen lochs and ponds. As the stones slid across the ice toward a painted target, they curved, or curled; brooms were used to sweep the ice of debris and snow from the path of the stones.,In the 18th century, Scottish immigrants brought to curling to the United States, where it spread across the northern part of the country and Canada. In the 1850's a pond was built exclusively for curlers in Central Park in Manhattan.,Though most Americans have never heard of the game, it is the oldest  continuously played sport in the country, and as of 1998, a recognized Olympic medal sport.,Lower Connecticut's curlers today number about 125, with an interim home at the Ardsley Country Club in Westchester County while the club searches for a permanent site in Fairfield County. Until last year, the club had its own rink at the County Club of Darien; club members are currently negotiating to build a new center with the Norwalk River Rowing Association in Norwalk.,''We have the opposite problem of most organizations,'' said Mr. Cleveland. ''We have enough money that we could break ground tomorrow; we simply need to find a site.'',On a recent Sunday afternoon, Mr. Cleveland nursed a post-game drink in front of a blazing fire in what is known as the warming room at the Ardsley Curling Club, and discussed the sport he has played with a passion for 15 years. Three lanes of ice are set behind a window in the warming room where kibitzers keep the bar active and engage in Monday morning-quarterbacking.,The curling season runs from October to March, not inconveniently opposite the golfing season, with which the sport is also compared.  That being so, Mr. Cleveland is quick to say, ''We want to dispel the idea that we're all country clubbers.''  Most curl because it's in their blood; Mr. Cleveland's grandparents, for example, curled in Toronto. The vice-president of the Nutmeg Curling Club, Jill Owens, curled with her family in Green Bay, Wisc. ''When our family relocated to Connecticut,'' Ms. Owens said, ''my father looked for a curling club before he looked for a house.'',Recent converts to curling, however, are no less intense. Lydia and Charles Chinzi of Rowayton represent the new guard; they began curling a year ago and now make the biweekly commute to Ardsley. An engaging, active couple (she figure skates, he plays rugby), they admitted to their mutual competition (each is head of human resources for their companies). ''This is the one  sport that we can be on par with each other,'' Ms. Chinzi explained.,To witness an end of curling (similar to an inning in baseball) is to be alternately convinced at how ridiculously simple the sport appears and awed by the precision of the placement of a 42-pound granite stone.,Each team of four players shoots two stones (also called rocks) each end, alternately with their counterpart on the opposing team. The player releases the stone with a spin and two other players sweep or polish the ice to create friction and cause the stone to travel farther toward its intended goal -- a 12-foot scoring circle (or house) with a bullet-holed center tee. The object of shooting is to get the stone to rest at a predetermined place to do one of three things: score, protect a scoring rock or move another rock.,The score is determined after each end of 16 stones; stones in the house must be closer to the tee than any opposing stone to score.,Strength is not as important as finesse and strategy, illustrating why the sport is sometimes referred to as chess on ice. That is how it is possible for 78-year-old Roland Will of Easton to play with teammates some 50 years younger. A man with horn-rimmed glasses and a silvery white mustache who favors a red fedora and rep tie even on ice, he is known to quote Tennyson's ''Charge of the Light Brigade'' following a particularly good throw.,And essential to the sport is the manner in which it is played: Before each game teams shake hands and wish each other good curling; following play, curlers retire to the warming room where the winner buys the loser a round of drinks.,''I can think of no other sport that is so completely democratic,'' said  Kaytaro Sugahara of Stamford, who runs a shipping and holding company in Manhattan.

"TOM GREEN fidgeted in the back seat of his black stretch limousine Wednesday during the absurdly short three-block ride from his apartment to the Ed Sullivan Theater. He tugged on his close-cropped bangs, then played with the automatic windows, looking more like a reluctant high school senior on prom night than a rising MTV star en route to a taping of ''Late Show With David Letterman.'',''Maybe you could circle the block a few times,'' he said to the driver.,Not possible. In less than an hour, the lanky, 27-year-old host of MTV's surprise hit, ''The Tom Green Show,'' was to meet his comedic idol.  ''This is a turning-point day,'' Mr. Green mused ominously to his childhood best friend Derek Harvie, now one of his writers. That's because the two friends developed the idea for the show in high school, when they spent afternoons taping Mr. Green, dressed like Mr. Letterman, in tennis shoes and his father's suit. The bit evolved into ''The Tom Green Show,'' which after its debut on MTV last month is already a favorite with young fans, who understand his raucous blend of traditional talk and taped guerrilla pranks, ranging from endearing to gross.,Mr. Green has snorkeled in a shopping mall fountain to retrieve pennies as ''Scuba Hood.'' One hard-to-stomach segment has him trying to resuscitate a dead moose on a British Columbia highway.,Back in his native Canada, Mr. Green's show aired for four years on cable. Newspaper reports had been speculating about what ''stupid Green tricks'' the Ottawa-born comedian might try on ''Late Show.'' On a Canadian talk show once, Mr. Green pulled a raccoon carcass out of a suitcase, causing the show's host to run out of the studio to be sick.,But Mr. Green, who considers himself less a shock comic than a ''skinny, wide-eyed nerd from Canada,'' was the model of decorum in the presence of his hero. Mr. Letterman seemed amused, particularly by the ''Slut Mobile'' clip, in which Mr. Green airbrushed a pornographic image on the family car, forcing his father to catch a bus to work.,After the taping, Mr. Green was no less antsy. He and his entourage of writers and MTV producers regrouped at the Chelsea Piers bowling alley, to burn off nervous energy and monitor the Grammy Awards on the overhead televisions, which were advertising Mr. Green's Letterman appearance later that night. When Lauryn Hill receive her Grammy, Mr. Green broke into his trademark dance, a long-limbed cross between the Pee-wee Herman and the Running Man dances. With an equally comedic flourish he sent his fluorescent green ball down the lane. ''Two gutter balls,'' he grumbled. ''I'm normally better at bowling, but I've had too many White Russians.'',By 11:33 P.M., with ''The Late Show'' due on the air in two minutes, Mr. Green abandoned the game and sprinted up the stairs to the bar and grill to watch under two big-screen televisions. Mr. Green was pale, his deep-set eyes darted nervously. ''I bet they're going to edit me out,'' he said. But minutes later, he watched himself striding out to shake Mr. Letterman's hand, mugging for the audience with a pouty, deer-in-the-headlights stare.,After Mr. Letterman's prickly interview of Uma Thurman, Mr. Green's segment whirred with fast-paced banter. ''I got a new sweater,'' Mr. Green said. ''The Gap, 40 bucks?'' Mr. Letterman teased.,''Did I look nervous?'' Mr. Green asked when it was over. In lieu of confetti, one of Mr. Green's writers pelted him with sugar packets.",DOUGLAS CENTURY,"FEB. 28, 1999",A NIGHT OUT WITH: Tom Green; A Prankster As a Model Of Decorum,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/style/a-night-out-with-tom-green-a-prankster-as-a-model-of-decorum.html
"JOHN F. KENNEDY was President the last time I saw prices like those at the new Viva Grill, a charming little Italian neighborhood restaurant in New Hyde Park. The highest-priced entree there costs $5.95, pastas are in the $4.95 to $5.55 range, bowls of soup ring in at $2.75 and $3 and desserts go for $1.50 to $3.25. If the tab were any lower, the Viva Grill would have to pay its customers to eat there. As if  that was not enough, a grand-opening special (through April) offers free soup or salad with meals.,At this point, no doubt, many readers are thinking, what's the catch, there's something wrong here. Is it a joint? Are the portions minuscule? Is the food terrible? The answers to those questions are no, no and no.,The six-week-old Viva Grill, at 1629 Hillside Avenue (358-9187), is a cozy, two-room, 48-seat storefront  restaurant with white tablecloths and fresh flowers, tile floors and a tile roof over the bar, multi-paned mirrors, wall lantern lighting, a waist-high Roman-style fence in the barroom and tiny terra cotta figures sitting at a faux balcony high up on one of its stucco walls. Outside, an attractive imported tile facade greets diners.,Servings are of average to above-average size, and the food is anything but terrible. Not every dish hits a home run, but most are hearty, tasty renditions of Italian soul food: pasta, calamari, minestrone, sausage, meatballs, steak.,No, Viva Grill is not restaurant nirvana. No reservations, large portions, low prices and wholesome food add up to lines of people, especially on weekends. I arrived at 6:30 P.M. on a Friday night and found every table occupied and nine people waiting. Yet even with standing-room-only crowds, Tony Brucculeri, the extraordinarily obliging owner, and his smiling young staff never rush or push diners. The restaurant's hustling, though neophyte, waiters don't even make an attempt to remember who ordered what; rather upon delivering dishes, they ask.,When Mr. Brucculeri said, ''Yes, prices will go up after the grand opening,'' I though, aha, there's the explanation for these unrealistic, unbelievable prices, but then relaxed when he added, ''by 50 cents or a dollar.'' That sort of an increase seems rather insignificant after a dinner at which we sampled three soups, two salads, two appetizers, four entrees, a half-carafe of wine and three desserts and received a bill for $40.85.,One of those soups was memorable, another respectable and the third forgetable. Pasta e fagioli ($2.75), sporting a lusty tomato stock, thick with beans and macaroni, was terrific; minestrone ($2.75), jammed with vegetables, brightened up with a dash of salt, but a New England clam chowder special ($3), with no visible clams, was too sparse a brew to be redeemed.,A whole loaf of warm, better-than-average Italian bread arrived with the soup and salads. The latter, a medium-sized, standard, mixed-greens-and-tomatoes affair, and a Caesar (both $3.75), with rich, creamy dressing but without its promised foccacia accompaniment, were decent though not outstanding. Far better was cianfotta ($3.95), or warm, oven-roasted vegetables (peppers, onions, carrots, etc.) on a bed of lettuce with a soothing vinaigrette dressing.,Although all four entrees sampled were at least satisfactory, some were more interesting and outstanding than others. The interesting category included a thin, crisp-surfaced, full-of-flavor sausage pinwheel ($5.55), curled into a ringlet and served on polenta and red beans that effectively contrasted with the spicy meat. Outstanding was pesce alla vernaccia ($5.95), a pristine piece of fresh salmon gently cooked in white wine topped with tomatoes, capers and onions, although its bland rice and potato escorts constituted a starch overload. A jumbo bowl of gnocchi ($5.50), in a lively tomato sauce dotted with shreds of prosciutto, was solid rather than fluffy, with an earthy, robust flavor bang. Polpette infilzate ($4.95), or four skewered meatballs on rice, is a straightforward, nothing-special dish.,But torta gianduia ($3.25), a towering wedge of moist chocolate cake with a creamy pistachio sauce, studded with whole nuts was very special. So was a substantial, rich, rewarding, pudding-like tiramisu ($3.25) bordered with lady fingers. A slightly dry cappuccino cake special ($3.25) tasted more like chocolate than coffee.,Oh yes, at most restaurants, if a carafe of wine costs $10, a half carafe is priced at $6 or $6.50. But here a half is $5, yet another indication of Viva Grill's generous spirit.,Openings,Soup du Jour Bistro, a 55-seat restaurant at 44 Main Street in Northport (262-9744), where Wok on the Dock had been, opened on Feb. 8. Daniel Hurtas Jr., its chef and general manager, said fusion, New World cuisine featuring American, Asian, Spanish and Indian influences would be offered at entree prices $15.95 (braised chicken in bok choy with sushi rice) to $22.95 (Asian seafood cassoulet).,Mr. Hurtas, who was chef de cuisine at the Polo Grill of the Garden City Hotel in 1997, said his menu would change every two or three weeks. The bistro, with a traditional French look of wood floors, marble bar and light-bordered mirrors, is owned by Paul and Marie Gallowitsch, who also own Skipper's Pub in Northport.,Chez Peter, at 1846 Park Street in Atlantic Beach (239-2628), opened on Jan. 21. The 70-seat storefront with an Italian menu and French-skewered nightly specials offers dinner entrees that cost from $10.95 (pasta with vegetables in a garlic herb sauce) to $25.95 (surf and turf). The colorful, warm restaurant with artificial vines and flowers hanging from its ceiling is owned by Peter Schaeperkoetter, the chef, and Kenneth Ciampa, a pianist who alternates with two guitarists to provide daily entertainment.,Mr. Schaeperkoetter, who was a chef at Lombardi's in Island Park and in his family's corporate catering business, said a typical nightly special at Chez Peter is pan-seared filet mignon with a Roquefort cheese sauce with a splash of cognac.,Dynasty, a new 100-seat Chinese restaurant in Port Washington that specializes in traditional Cantonese cuisine, has been open since Dec. 10. John Moy, the manager of the attractive cathedral-ceiling spot at 405 Main Street (883-4100), whose brother, Larry Moy, is the chef, says Hawaiian lobster, a chunky version of lobster soong with jumbo prawns added, and wor shew opt, or Cantonese braised duck, are among the restaurant's specialties. Dinner entrees cost from $10.95 (chicken with garlic sauce) to $27 (dragon and phoenix, a chicken, lobster, shrimp dish).",RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM,"FEB. 28, 1999",A LA CARTE; Hearty Italian Food at Unbeatable Prices,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/nyregion/a-la-carte-hearty-italian-food-at-unbeatable-prices.html
"Republicans in the House of Representatives are looking to their new Speaker, Dennis Hastert, with a yearning that appears suspiciously like desperation. Few of them even pretend that they consider Hastert a forceful leader. As one leadership aide put it recently, and bluntly, ''What people like about Denny is that he's not going to do something stupid.'' Hastert is a modest, amiable soul who is fond of recalling his past career as a high-school wrestling coach. When party leaders came to Hastert in December to tell him that he needed to fill the breach created by the stunningly unexpected resignation of Robert Livingston, the Speaker-designate, Hastert, according to one Midwestern Congressman, ''wasn't sure he could do it, he wasn't sure he wanted to do it, and he was scared.'' What Hastert's colleagues are hoping is that the new Speaker will somehow save them from themselves, as if his bulky frame were a rampart standing between the G.O.P. and the cliff it seems disposed to race off. Hastert's real virtue is that he is not his predecessor, Newt Gingrich, for the retrospective view inside the party is that Gingrich is at the heart of practically everything that anyone thinks went wrong in the last few years. Talk to Republican House members, as I spent the past few weeks doing, and you'll hear that Gingrich was too obsessed with destroying the President, failed to remind the public of the party's accomplishments, caved to the Christian right and caved to the Clinton left. You would think that Gingrich was a virus alien to the party, rather than the party's leader and visionary for most of the decade.,Denny Hastert, the not-Newt, was trotted out for celebration at a closed-to-the-press party-leadership retreat in Williamsburg, Va., earlier this month. The retreat began with a sobering presentation from pollsters: current numbers, they explained, show that voters trust the Democrats more than the Republicans on almost all major issues, including taxes, an issue on which the G.O.P. has traditionally been favored by a significant margin. After dinner on the first night, Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, the new head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, screened a video made up of clips of gloating Democrats, designed to fire members with horror at the prospect of a Democratic takeover of the House -- which is precisely what would happen were an election held today, according to pollsters.,Hastert didn't speak until the following morning, when he got up and more or less said, according to a summary provided by one attendee, ''We need to work together, he's the coach, he wants to put other people in the spotlight.'' It was a pep talk, and not a particularly memorable one, and it lasted no more than 10 minutes. Then the group talked about issues and heard a presentation from executives of a marketing firm, who explained that in order to promote a winning message, the G.O.P. needed to empathize with voters, tone down the ideological content, personalize and simplify.,So yes, there had been a problem -- but with the marketing, not the message. ''The message needs to be delivered by people who are upbeat, who are connectors with folks out there, who can relate everything we're doing to people's everyday lives,'' Jennifer Dunn, a Congresswoman from Washington who is herself an important element of the Republicans' new look, told me a few days after the retreat. Or as Representative Joe Scarborough of Florida put it, with perhaps a trace of irony, ''Denny is this year's model.'',As the Congressional Republicans head out into battle with the ordeal of impeachment finally behind them, they hope to win back the public with a kinder, gentler face. It should become clear soon enough whether the problem really was Newt, and whether the answer is Denny. An alternative theory constitutes the nightmare underneath the professions of optimism and bonhomie -- that the House Republicans have actually lost touch with ordinary Americans, or rather are captive to a base that is itself out of touch with ordinary Americans, as the Democrats were 15 or so years ago. Michael Forbes, the Long Island Congress-man who publicly agonized over impeachment before voting with his party, said to me, ''If we keep defining the party by the extreme right, not only will you see Republicans leaving the party, but you will also see a permanent Republican minority where we will lose the White House, we will lose the House and we will lose the Senate.'' And then Forbes added, ''I have great hopes in the ascension of Denny Hastert.'',Among the Congressional Republicans there is no bafflement like the bafflement over the failure of the American people to rally to the cause of impeachment. John Doolittle, a California Congressman who has both his car and his office desk festooned with bumper stickers that read, ''Impeach Clinton for the Children,'' said: ''I feel good about impeaching the President, and I would happily do it tomorrow. How the rest of the country can not feel good about it is truly beyond me.'' Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, advances the almost metaphysical argument that ordinary citizens, unlike Congressional Republicans, simply can not own up to their own true feelings on the subject. ''People don't want to admit that the man they voted for President is so deeply flawed because that says something about themselves,'' Luntz said.,A number of moderate Republicans pointed out that many of their party brethren loathe the President so passionately that they simply cannot conceive that people of good will could feel otherwise. Given their own scorn, they cannot admit that most Americans disagree with them without feeling contempt for the people themselves, an emotion very few politicians permit themselves to express. Tom DeLay, the Republican majority whip and the leader of the party's Clinton-hating faction, insisted in a speech before the House that impeachment was a matter of ''relativism versus absolute truth.'' Given the choice, Americans, it turned out, preferred a tolerant and forgiving relativism.,Some version of this understanding has now in fact become patent to many Republicans. Vin Weber, a former Congressman and Reagan-era optimist who along with Gingrich proclaimed the coming of a new ''conservative opportunity society,'' said, ''The image that our party is defined by a hectoring moralism is as dangerous to us as it is on the left if they're defined by a pandering permissiveness.'',But it's also true that impeachment did not provoke a new tone of hectoring moralism from an essentially secular party; it brought to the fore passions that have been bubbling at least since the ''revolution'' of 1994 and perhaps since the election of Clinton two years before. Newt Gingrich stoked those passions and was finally, in the classic revolutionary denouement, consumed by them. The Speaker staved off a coup from the right in the summer of 1997 and then was ousted after last year's election. And on his way out, like a Jacobin railing at the Terror as he's led to the tumbrels, Gingrich warned darkly of the party's ''perfectionist caucus.'' This is the kind of epithet that may stick to the House Republicans.,Gingrich's lament suggests a very different explanation for the Republicans' grave problems. I heard such a theory from Peter King, the Nassau County Republican who became a hero to Democrats everywhere by his unwavering, and very public, opposition to the impeachment of President Clinton. King has been held in fairly low regard inside his own party since he made himself into a sort of celebrity martyr, boasting of his victimization by party leaders and almost flaunting his subsequent marginalization inside the G.O.P. At the same time, as King told me, he has a perfect voting record with the Christian Coalition. ''I am not a moderate,'' he said flatly.,King doesn't see the party's problems precisely in ideological terms. In the 80's, he explained, the party's base was not Sunbelt evangelicals but Reagan Democrats. ''They weren't Holy Roller types, but they wanted to have some semblance of decency, they wanted to reward hard work.'' Today, King went on to say, those Reagan Democrats are ''looking for someone like Reagan, but what they're seeing are these really harsh, unrelenting, unforgiving, avenging-angel types -- that scares them off. And as I look around the House of Representatives, there are very few people who would be comfortable with Ronald Reagan in terms of their attitudes -- the Democrats are the enemy, Bill Clinton is evil, politics is evil.'' It galls King that President Clinton is now so often surrounded by cops, as Reagan and Bush used to be. Those are the Reagan Democrats the party has lost.,One hears this critique often from an older generation of Republican. Robert Michel, who was the minority leader of the House during the Bush years, said that he and Tom Foley, the the Speaker, used to meet weekly to discuss issues, alternating offices from week to week -- a practice that sounds as dated as the etiquette of World War I flying aces. Michel said that he told Gingrich that he had to engage Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader, in a similar dialogue, but Gingrich, Michel said, ''always envisioned the opponent as the enemy rather than the political adversary.'' When I mentioned this story in front of an aide to a leading Republican, she snorted, ''What it got Michel was the distrust of many of his members.'',Perhaps, and yet Republican governors around the country, including George Pataki, George W. Bush, Tommy Thompson and Christine Whitman, have gained enormous popularity by emphasizing effective government over moral or ideological campaigns. You won't see many of these governors mounting the barricades on issues like immigration or affirmative action, not to mention partial-birth abortion.,Gingrich may have instituted the style and the rhetoric of total war, but it is now a deep-seated reflex among the House Republicans. It was, after all, Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader, who said of Hillary Clinton, ''All her friends are Marxists,'' and who referred to Barney Frank, the openly gay Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, as ''Barney Fag.'' Tom DeLay, the House whip, has compared the Environmental Protection Agency to the Gestapo. Indeed, DeLay, who has replaced Gingrich as the most powerful figure in the House as well as the Democrats' extremist of choice, is an instructive figure in this regard. DeLay is a small businessman -- an exterminator, more precisely and deliciously -- who represents the new middle-class suburbs that have grown up outside of Houston, an area very similar demographically to Gingrich's DeKalb County and also largely devoid of the yeasty ethnic mix that, Representative King would say, lent a certain realism and restraint to the Reagan Democrats.,DeLay was elected to Congress in 1984 as a fiscal conservative and deregulator, if a rather extreme one. He has referred to himself as ''a free-market nut.'' In 1995 he infuriated moderate Republicans by attaching to an appropriations bill a series of riders that would have virtually annihilated the E.P.A.'s enforcement powers. But in recent years, DeLay has also developed strong ties to the Christian right. Both he and Armey are among the few Congressional members of the Council for National Policy, an organization of right-wing political and religious leaders. DeLay has taken to the floor of the House to call for the impeachment of Federal judges whom the Council deems dangerous liberal activists. Randy Tate, the head of the Christian Coalition, used to be one of DeLay's deputy whips, and they remain close. A number of Republicans suggested to me, without questioning the depth of DeLay's convictions, that he had recognized that if you want the power that comes with a mass following in today's Republican Party, you cultivate the Christian Right.,DeLay is not exactly a practitioner of the Bob Michel school of genteel bipartisanship. He is known inside the Beltway as the Hammer, a nickname that he cherishes like a scar from an old brawl. Shortly after Tate won election to Congress from Washington in 1994, DeLay sent a letter to PAC's listing the amounts each had given to Tate's opponent. ''I was surprised to see you opposed Randy Tate,'' he wrote. ''You now have the opportunity to work toward a positive future relationship. . . . Your immediate support for Randy Tate is personally important to me and the Republican leadership team.'' DeLay had served notice that lapses into bipartisanship would no longer be accepted. ''He is,'' as one prominent Republican said wonderingly, ''almost harsher than Newt.'',DeLay and Armey met with, and encouraged, disaffected conservatives who plotted Gingrich's overthrow in the summer of 1997. The plot collapsed when, according to participants, Armey realized that he wouldn't be elected Speaker and exposed the conspiracy to Gingrich. In the Shakespearean scene that followed, Armey denied any role in the confabulations, while DeLay made a clean breast of everything. This had the effect, paradoxically, of virtually destroying Armey's credibility, and greatly strengthening DeLay's. Ray LaHood, a mild-mannered figure who represents Bob Michel's old district in Illinois, said that DeLay ''didn't try to weasel out of it the way Armey did.'' Stalwarts of the class of 1994 like Joe Scarborough now speak of Armey with open scorn and of DeLay with the deepest respect.,It was DeLay, almost more than Gingrich, who became the public face, and the private engine, of the impeachment process. He defied Gingrich last March by publicly demanding that Clinton tell the truth about Monica Lewinsky, when the Speaker had enjoined the caucus to stick to the high road at least until it was safe to descend. Just after the election, when impeachment looked like a losing proposition and many Republicans were seeking a way out, DeLay stepped forward once again and announced on television that censure was an unacceptable option, thus killing whatever momentum the measure had among Republicans. What is so striking about DeLay is that he is in many ways a classic politician -- a genius at delivering highway money to his home county of Fort Bend, a dependable vote counter and, by all accounts, a tremendously effective whip. He has all the earmarks of a secular politician; and yet he is at the same time a charter member of the perfectionist caucus.,The truly secular politician does what the former Senator Alfonse D'Amato did. D'Amato, a partisan if ever there was one, used his position as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee to pursue the Clintons remorselessly, exploring every obscure corner of the Whitewater story. But when the Senator realized that the so-called scandal wasn't getting much political traction, he abruptly announced that the country had had enough of Whitewater. This was arguably a consummate act of hypocrisy on D'Amato's part, but it rested on a shrewd appraisal of public opinion (though one that may have come too late to get D'Amato himself re-elected).,DeLay, on the other hand, played the part of the avenging angel to a fare-thee-well. And yet he could do so with no fear of the consequences -- unlike D'Amato -- because so many of his constituents thought he was right. Right-wing voters in the Sunbelt have thus enabled, and driven, a politics of purity and wrath that may turn out to be ruinous for the party as a whole.,DeLay has been a particularly formidable player of late. Robert Livingston waited to publicly announce his candidacy to succeed Gingrich until the morning after DeLay promised him the support of his 65-man whip team, widely recognized as the most disciplined and powerful grouping in the House. And when Livingston, having been outed by Larry Flynt as an adulterer, announced his resignation from the House, it was DeLay who marshaled support for Denny Hastert, his own deputy and longtime friend, while the members were still on the floor and in shock.,''The truth of the matter is that Tom DeLay orchestrated Denny Hastert's ascension to Speaker,'' Ray LaHood said, confirming the obvious. DeLay, who is said by his friends to recognize that he is too divisive a figure to serve as Speaker, has contented himself with the role of kingmaker. But some of DeLay's colleagues, and several Republican advisers, worry that so long as a vacuum looms at the top of the party, DeLay will fill it. That's one reason why they're hoping that Denny Hastert will not be a vacuum.,And so in the person of the new Speaker and his perky, upbeat team of messengers, including Jennifer Dunn and the former football stars J.C. Watts Jr. and Steve Largent, the Williamsburg view of the party acknowledges the truth in Peter King's critique. Party leaders recognize that the rhetoric of total warfare, of Barney Fag and the Gestapo, has not gone down well with the American public. The party wants to substitute some smiling faces for Tom DeLay's angry glare and to restore the sunny optimism of Ronald Reagan.,G.O.P. advisers like Ralph Reed and Frank Luntz have begun to remind the party of why it was that Reagan was so popular and masterful a figure. Recently, in a private memo to party leaders, Luntz wrote: ''Think about how often we were on the tube last year 'blasting' someone or something. . . . Ronald Reagan hardly ever raised his voice, yet his message was clear, persuasive and popular. Let us learn from our Great Communicator.'' Luntz suggested the Reagan-esque strategy of head-shaking ridicule and even provided examples: ''Bill Clinton wants to spend millions of your taxpayer dollars on dance lessons for convicts. Convicts!! It's a prison. Can you visualize prisoners dancing? Who leads?'',It is probably safe to say that neither Tom DeLay nor Dick Armey can be trusted to bring off this joke with just the right tone of voice. (During the President's most recent State of the Union Message, cameras periodically focused on DeLay and Armey as they smirked and grimaced and virtually sat on their hands to keep from having to applaud.) Denny Hastert has yet to show anything resembling the Reagan touch; in one of his few television appearances so far, in fact, Hastert said that he didn't plan on making many television appearances.,Still, Hastert may succeed merely by not making speeches and not taunting the Democrats -- the bar has been set that low. He scored points by giving his maiden speech in the well of the House rather than in a partisan setting, and he has said that he wants to speak regularly to Richard Gephardt, though an aide of Gephardt's said that the meetings to date have been procedural rather than substantive. Several of the Republican legislators I spoke to said that they are waiting for a sign -- a sign that Hastert realizes the need to publicly affirm a new identity for the party. Hastert has yet to satisfy them, but he has begun to make tiny realignments in the party's own structure of power in the House. Livingston's tenure had promised to be an unpleasant one for Armey, since the two men were not on good terms. I was told that Livingston had planned to give one of Armey's extremely desirable Capitol offices to another member; if he had, Hastert canceled the order. Hastert has also separated himself ever so slightly from his old boss. DeLay had taken control of the party's ''associations'' -- from the K Street trade groups to the grass-roots organizations -- from the party conference chairman, John Boehner. Hastert restored half the associations to the new conference chairman, J.C. Watts, and left the other half with DeLay.,The party emerged from Williamsburg with a bread-and-butter Republican agenda, which members and leadership aides now recite on command: tax cuts, an increase in defense spending, local control of the schools, privatization of Social Security. Noticeable by their omission are those fractious social issues, like a ban on partial-birth abortion or the abolition of the National Endowment for the Arts. The new message is ''issues we all agree on,'' as Jennifer Dunn puts it. It will be intriguing to see how long party leaders can keep a lid on those other issues. When I mentioned to John Linder, a Congressman from Georgia and the former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, that the party seemed eager not to stir up a hornet's nest, he said very softly and rather implacably, ''It will be stirred up.'' Linder promised that the social issues will be attached as riders to appropriations bills, as they have been, to the despair of party moderates, in recent years.,The reason why Denny Hastert, or Frank Luntz, may not be able to cure what ails the G.O.P. is that the problem is not simply the messenger or the tone of voice. The party can not be jollied out of its hectoring moralism. That part of the party that is beholden to, and identifies with, the Christian right is profoundly at odds with the part that isn't, and doesn't. In New England, the Republicans have lost four Congressional seats since the start of the Gingrich revolution and have barely held on to three others. Chris Shays, the classically moderate Congressman from country-club Connecticut, said, ''I attribute that to my constituents and other constituents in New England saying the Republican majority is too extreme.'' When I mentioned Shays's remark to John Linder, he said: ''Our moderates would like to think that we need to move further off the right and do deals and show how reasonable we are, and then the moderates will vote for us. And my view is, the moderates don't like us. Our base likes us; and our base is not moderate.'' Of course, those moderates do vote for Republicans, but in Connecticut and not in Georgia. The same compromises that depress turnout among Southern evangelicals bring swing voters over to the Republicans in the Northeast and Midwest.,The fear among many party professionals is that the party has marginalized itself -- and collaborated in the President's adroit marginalization of it -- to the point of no return. As Glenn Bolger, a Republican pollster, explained, the issues in the last election ''tilted extremely strongly against us. The big issues that voters named were education, Social Security, Medicare -- issues where the Democrats are strong. Taxes and the other Republican issues are way down the list. Then you have the Democrats embracing Republican positions as being New Democrat. The Democrats sound just like us, so how do we differentiate ourselves? We move a little more to the right and give up on the center.'' Or as Chris Shays puts it, ''It was like we had to distinguish ourselves, so if Clinton had a good idea, we had to have a bad idea.'' That is to say, ''triangulation'' worked: Bill Clinton ran against traditional liberalism, and the Republicans ran against the President's centrist liberalism, and Clinton -- and centrism -- won.,It is also true that the Republican standbys that Ronald Reagan could count on -- Communism, crime -- have either evaporated or lost their edge of urgency. Of course, the Democrats could still go on the kind of bender that Republicans used to be able to count on. President Clinton has vowed to set aside 62 percent of the projected surplus to shore up the Social Security system -- and the Republicans have agreed -- but that still leaves nearly $100 billion over the next two budget years. The Republicans want to use some or all of that money for tax cuts, while the Democrats want to use it for Medicare, a few far-more-modest tax cuts and the kind of domestic initiatives that have been waiting in the wings for just such a moment of historic prosperity. The Democrats, too, have an impatient base.,What's more, the economy could finally tumble off the rails, though Republicans can't permit themselves to openly root for a recession. Finally, the G.O.P. could come up with a Presidential candidate more charismatic than Al Gore, which wouldn't seem terribly difficult to do. A lot of things could happen, but the auguries are grim. ''Right now,'' said one Republican strategist, ''we're whistling past the graveyard.''",JAMES TRAUB,"FEB. 28, 1999",A Curse on the House,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/magazine/a-curse-on-the-house.html

"After losing to Tiger Woods this morning, Stewart Cink correctly predicted that Woods would be beaten by Jeff Maggert.,''I don't think he's going to win this afternoon,'' Cink said, referring to Woods. ''I played with him last week, and I played with him today. He's just not playing his game. He's not playing well enough to beat someone who's playing really well, and Jeff has played well all year.'',Today's 2-and-1 victory over Woods was a high point in Maggert's career, a comeback victory against the world's top-ranked player. For Woods, it was a disappointing defeat. And it left the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship with a final four -- Maggert, Steve Pate, Andrew Magee and John Huston -- that nobody expected, one that will seem anticlimactic to those looking for high-profile faces.,Eliminating the last of the top 20 seeded players, and advancing to Saturday's semifinals, Maggert defeated Woods and continued an unpredictable tournament at La Costa Resort and Spa that has sent the top-seeded players reeling and packing. Maggert will face Pate in one of Saturday's semifinal matches, while Magee will face Huston in the other.,''Tiger was the dragon, and somebody had to slay him,'' said Maggert, a 35-year-old tour veteran who was Woods's Ryder Cup teammate in 1997. ''Everyone wants to play the best player in the world. That's how you prove yourself.'',Give Cink credit for his prediction, because many people are baffled by what has transpired in this first event in the World Golf Championship series. How unlikely was a Maggert, Pate, Huston, Magee final four? And how many people will watch it?,The semifinalists have played superb golf to reach this point, but consider these facts: Maggert, No. 24, is the highest-seeded player left in the tournament. Huston was seeded 27th. Magee was seeded 50th. Pate was seeded 61st, barely qualifying for the 64-player field. None of the semifinalists have won a major. Maggert has not won on the PGA Tour since 1993, while Magee has not won since 1994.,Players have insisted all week that in match play, anything can happen. But when the world's top 64 players teed off Wednesday morning, people expected at least one of the top 23 to stick around until Saturday. Instead, Maggert knocked off Woods today and kept alive his chance to win the $1 million first-place prize.,Maggert wanted to play Woods. And when the opportunity came, Maggert answered the challenge. In today's other quarterfinal matches, Pate knocked off Eduardo Romero, 3 and 2, Huston defeated Jose Maria Olazabal, 2 and 1, while Magee defeated Shigeki Maruyama, 1 up.,But the Woods-Maggert match was the most compelling of the day. Woods built a legendary match play reputation while winning three consecutive United States Amateur championships, and once he grabs a lead, he usually closes out the match. But today, it didn't happen. Woods was 2 up after three holes, but he never won another hole.,Maggert tied the match on No. 10, making a 10-foot putt for birdie. He took the lead for good at No. 12, making a five-footer for birdie, after Woods missed a 12-footer. Then Maggert delivered a demoralizing blow to Woods on No. 15, making an 18-foot birdie putt that gave Maggert a 2-up lead with three holes to play.,For Woods, there would be no miracle finish, and the match ended at the par-5 17th hole. Maggert reached the green in three shots, then hit a superb lag putt from about 30 feet that stopped less than two feet from the hole. Woods conceded the par, then faced a 15-foot putt for birdie to keep the match alive. Woods missed the putt left, and the match was over, as Woods settled for the $150,000 awarded to the quarterfinalists.,''I didn't hit enough good shots close to the hole where I was going to make birdies,'' Woods said. ''I made three birdies and 14 pars. It wasn't good enough.'',At least Woods lasted until the fourth round. It became clear in the morning that the upsets would continue today, when Romero eliminated Phil Mickelson, 2 and 1, while Pate defeated Fred Couples, 1 up. Needing to win No. 18 to keep the match alive, Couples hit a poor drive, then failed to chip in for par from 20 feet.,''I played O.K., but Steve played better,'' Couples said. ''The turning point came at the 12th, where I had a chance of winning the hole, but fluffed an easy chip.'',Today's best player was probably Huston, who rallied to beat Patrik Sjoland, 1 up, this morning, despite being down 3 with five holes to play. Huston clinched his victory over Sjoland with a terrific 12-foot downhill putt at No. 18 to save par. Then, this afternoon, Huston took a 3-up lead over Olazabal after four holes, and Huston never trailed thereafter.,''I was fortunate to get through this morning, and this afternoon I played really well,'' Huston said.,So Saturday's semifinals will feature four players who started the week in the background, but who have thrust themselves into the limelight. This week has illustrated just how wild match play can be. But nobody who made it to the final four was complaining.,''I love match play,'' Pate said, laughing. ''I'm not surprised that a lot of the top seeds are gone. But I am surprised that there aren't any of them left.''",CLIFTON BROWN,"FEB. 27, 1999",WORLD GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS: FINAL FOUR; Woods Falls To Maggert; Top Names Are All Gone,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/sports/world-golf-championships-final-four-woods-falls-maggert-top-names-are-all-gone.html

"Moving swiftly to strengthen her imprint on New Jersey's highest court, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today nominated Attorney General Peter G. Verniero, her longtime political ally, to fill an unexpected vacancy on the State Supreme Court.,The day after Justice Stewart G. Pollock announced that he would leave the bench in September, Mrs. Whitman announced the selection of Mr. Verniero, a loyal confidant who has previously served as her chief of staff, general counsel and campaign lawyer. To replace Mr. Verniero, she nominated her chief counsel, John Farmer.,Both nominations require confirmation by the Legislature, but neither is expected to face much opposition.,In his two years as Governor Whitman's appointed Attorney General, Mr. Verniero has aggressively championed her agenda, fighting successfully against a court order that would have forced vast increases in state allocations to urban school districts, protecting the sex offender notification statute known as Megan's Law, and successfully arguing before the United States Supreme Court that New Jersey was the rightful owner of part of Ellis Island.,Mr. Verniero, 39, was the object of considerable skepticism when he joined the Whitman administration in 1994, because many Trenton insiders questioned his relative youth and limited courtroom experience. But even his former political adversaries acknowledge that he has been an effective advocate for the Governor's causes.,''He came here with a lot to learn, and he's learned it,'' said Harold Hodes, who helped direct the campaign of the former Gov. Jim Florio and is now a lobbyist. ''As chief counsel, chief of staff, attorney general -- three very different jobs -- he's done them all well. So there's no reason to believe he won't also learn to become an excellent State Supreme Court Justice.'',But some state Democratic legislators complained that Mrs. Whitman was nominating a political figure rather than a practicing judge, even though New Jersey governors of both parties have made similar appointments in the past. Mrs. Whitman's most recent appointee to the court, Chief Justice Deborah Poritz, also served as Attorney General.,Some legal scholars also said the nomination, Gov. Whitman's third opportunity to select a member of the seven-judge bench, signaled an attempt to rein in a court with a history of judicial activism. Two more justices will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 before the Governor's term expires in 2001, and some legal scholars voiced concern that she would leave office with a far more conservative bench than the one she inherited.,''There's a great danger that this court's tradition will be undermined,'' said Frank Askin , a professor of law at Rutgers University and founder of the school's constitutional rights center. ''Peter Verniero has never demonstrated the qualities that have distinguished the New Jersey State Supreme Court, namely a passionate and intellectual commitment to the rights of the powerless, the poor, or the rights of the individual. I think there's a huge stature gap, but I'll keep my mind open. Maybe he'll grow into the job.'',Mrs. Whitman dismissed suggestions that she is creating a court with a more restrictive view of its own powers and insisted she will continue the practice of choosing judicial nominees based on their qualifications, rather than their ideology.,''I have never sat down and run through a list of litmus test issues,'' she said. ''There is no conscious effort to make the court more conservative or liberal.'',The Legislature will vote on the nomination by June, and, because both houses are controlled by Republicans, Mr. Verniero is expected to win approval easily.,Appearing at a news conference in the Governor's office, Mr. Verniero  said he was gratified to be nominated, but he politely deflected most questions about his beliefs regarding the powers of the court. In arguing a case before the court last year, Mr. Verniero reminded the justices that they did not have the power to create law, but today he would not say whether he would take a more expansive view of judicial powers once he is on the bench.,''Courts often have to interpret statutes, and my only approach will be to come to each case with an open mind,'' he said.,Mr. Verniero was born in Montclair and graduated from Drew University in 1981 and Duke University Law School in 1984. His involvement in Republican politics dates back to his high school days, when he wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1976, arguing that the Republican Party was still alive and well, despite the Watergate scandal and the re-election defeat of President Gerald R. Ford.,United States Representative  Richard Zimmer noticed the letter and recruited young Mr. Verniero to work on his campaign. In the decade that followed, Mr. Verniero went on to run the campaigns of several Republican legislators and rose to the position of executive director of New Jersey's Republican State Committee. In 1984, he served as a law clerk to Justice Robert L. Clifford of the State Supreme Court. He also worked at several New Jersey law firms, and was a director of Herold & Haines, a Warren, N.J., firm that specialized in civil litigation, commercial law and election law.,Since becoming Attorney General, Mr. Verniero has assiduously avoided political events, declining to attend fund-raisers, inaugural balls or other social engagements that might raise the appearance of a partisan favoritism or conflict of interest. Shortly after Mr. Verniero was named the Governor's chief of staff in 1995, Mr. Hodes sent him two gifts, a bottle of vanilla flavoring and a box of Ivory Snow, playful references to Mr. Verniero's fierce loyalty to Mrs. Whitman and his spotless reputation. Mr. Verniero refused to accept them,  saying it would be improper to take any gratuity from a lobbyist.,''He's squeaky clean,'' Mr. Hodes said.,Mrs. Whitman said she was most grateful for Mr. Verniero's successful efforts to uphold Megan's Law and to oppose the litigation that would have forced the state to pay $141 million to 30 school districts in low-income neighborhoods.,But some civil-rights advocates  criticize Mr. Verniero's response to lingering allegations that some state troopers routinely pick out black motorists for tickets and arrests, an illegal practice known as racial profiling. As Attorney General, Mr. Verniero has allowed his staff to represent the troopers in an appeal of a 1996 ruling by a Gloucester County judge who found that troopers stopped motorists on the New Jersey Turnpike solely because of race.,The issue of racial profiling arose again last April when two troopers stopped a van with four young black and Hispanic men and shot three of them, but it was not until last month that Mr. Verniero announced that he was conducting a full-scale review of the State Police. Although some civil rights leaders said the Attorney General's office could not be trusted to investigate the matter because of its efforts to defend the State Police against racial profiling charges, Mr. Verniero said yesterday that he received support for his Supreme Court nomination from the head of the Black Minister's Council of New Jersey, the Rev. Reginald Jackson.,Mr. Jackson could not be reached for comment.,The incoming Attorney General, Mr. Farmer, said he will continue the state police evaluation if it is not completed when Mr. Verniero steps down, most likely in June. Mr. Farmer, 41, of Stockton, N.J., is a former assistant United States attorney who prosecuted a wide range of criminal offenses, including organized crime and narcotics cases.,Mr. Farmer received both his bachelor's and law degrees from Georgetown University and once worked as a clerk to State Supreme Court Justice Alan B. Handler, one of the court's most liberal members.",DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI,"FEB. 27, 1999",Whitman Nominates Attorney General for Supreme Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/nyregion/whitman-nominates-attorney-general-for-supreme-court.html
"Ridiculing academic writing is becoming commonplace these days.,The journal Philosophy and Literature has taken to holding an annual Bad Writing Contest, with prizes going to the work of some of the country's top scholars. There is even an Internet site that automatically creates a ''post-modern'' essay, replete with bloated jargon and incomprehensible sentence structure, every time someone logs onto it (www.cs.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin /postmodern). (''If one examines a post-dialectic conceptualist theory, one is faced with a choice: either reject post-dialectic conceptualist theory or conclude that culture is capable of truth,'' was a recent creation.),Yet the debate has taken a new twist recently with a decision by Edward Said, the new president of the Modern Language Association, to use his first official column in the association's newsletter to denounce bad writing. In an essay on how science is growing at the expense of the humanities, he accused literature departments of fostering incomprehensible writing and factionalism, resulting even more in their ''diminishment and incoherence.'',It wasn't just Mr. Said's position as head of the largest and most influential organization of literary scholars that caught people's attention, however: Mr. Said himself is a progenitor of a new kind of literary and cultural criticism that has frequently used difficult language.,One of the country's most prominent literary critics, Mr. Said concedes that his own writing hasn't always been easily accessible, but he said in an interview: ''I moved away from that kind of thing many years ago, because I feel myself that it's terribly important as an intellectual to communicate as immediately and forcefully as possible.,''At some point critics and writers become parodies of themselves.'',Indeed, in 1996, Alan Sokal, a New York University physicist, tricked the journal ''Social Text'' into publishing his parody of academic writing, filled with nonsensical words and gibberish, as a serious article.,The argument over bad writing is more than a schoolyard spat. It is at the heart of the continuing ''culture wars,'' feeding conservative attacks on the abandonment of traditional standards and subjects at universities. What's more, it raises questions about the purpose of scholarship. What is the goal of literary and cultural criticism? Who should the nation's educated elite be talking to? Are scholars increasingly making themselves irrelevant?,The debate has energetic advocates on both sides. In last week's issue of The New Republic, Martha Nussbaum, a professor of law and ethics at the University of Chicago, wrote a long attack on Judith Butler, a Berkeley professor and influential feminist theorist, for ''ponderous and obscure'' writing. An essay by Ms. Butler that won first prize in this year's Bad Writing Contest said in part: ''The insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony.'' Ms. Butler's writing, Ms. Nussbaum charged, resorts to mystification in an effort to create ''an aura of importance.'',''It is difficult to come to grips with Butler's ideas, because it is difficult to figure out what they are,'' Ms. Nussbaum writes. ''Hungry women are not fed by this, battered women are not sheltered by it, raped women do not find justice in it, gays and lesbians do not achieve legal protections through it.'',Ms. Butler declined comment. But Jonathan Culler, a Cornell professor who edits the magazine Diacritics, the original publisher of the ''winning'' essay by Ms. Butler, said of the contest that it was ''bad faith'' to pick out a few sentences of a larger work and ridicule them.,Joan Scott, a professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, offered a more aggressive defense. When a scholar uses difficult language, he or she is ''not pretending to be a journalist'' or to be writing for the general public, Ms. Scott said. She argues that the attack on academic writing is ''a kind of anti-intellectualism that is everywhere in the culture, a demand for things they already agree with.'',Despite his recent criticisms, Mr. Said clearly has a soft spot for the writing of some of his colleagues. He too said that difficult writing was sometimes necessary in scholarly work. For example, Mr. Said said that Fredric Jameson, a Duke professor who uses Marxist theory to study post-modernism and whose work has won the Bad Writing Contest twice, was ''in his way a poet'' whose writing, though difficult, has a cumulative brilliance. When scholars explore new areas, Mr. Said explained, they sometimes use language in new ways ''about which there is no consensus.'' He added that there was similarly no consensus about the subjects they study either.,Homi Bhabha, a University of Chicago English professor who works on the culture of post-colonial societies, is an example, Mr. Said said. Although he called Mr. Bhabha an admired and gifted friend, he did say: ''Writers like Bhabha are looking for the occasion to work out ideas. There's something unfinished about it.'',Mr. Bhabha's work won second place in this year's Bad Writing Contest with an essay that included the words: ''If, for a while, the ruse of desire is calculable for the uses of discipline soon the repetition of guilt, justification, pseudo-scientific theories, superstition, spurious authorities, and classifications can be seen as the desperate effort to 'normalize' formally the disturbance of a discourse.'',He responded to winning the bad writing prize with what his critics might say was uncharacteristic brevity: ''I'm trying not to write bad sentences, particularly not ones that will be read in New Zealand,'' the home of Denis Dutton, the editor of the journal that sponsors the contest.,Just why is there is so much of what some call ''bad'' or what others call ''demanding'' writing?,Ms. Nussbaum says scholars are sometimes encouraged to write in obscure language. ''Graduate students in analytic philosophy often get the message that if you write in a way that is accessible to nonspecialists, it means you are going to hurt your career,'' she said.,Ralph Hexter, dean of humanities at the University of California at Berkeley, who has written on difficult language in classics scholarship, says that some scholarly language is a result of an effort to make literary or cultural criticism ''a human science.'' He said, ''A more scientific approach creates an expectation that there might be a scientific vocabulary.'',Mr. Hexter conceded that sometimes a scholar who uses difficult language makes it ''harder to recognize good writing or bad writing.'',''If you define good writing as clarity, limpidity,'' he said, ''most of this will be by definition bad writing.'',Both Mr. Hexter and Mr. Bhabha say that one reason academic writing is sometimes hard to understand is that the work of the new generation of scholars is heavily influenced by the Continental philosophers, Europeans like Sartre, Hegel and Jacques Derrida, who are practitioners of difficult language themselves. ''The basic orientation of Anglo-American philosophy has been very empirical,'' said Mr. Bhabha, who was born in India and trained at Oxford University. But ''South Asian and Continental traditions tend to be more metaphoric and symbolic in their use of language.'',Contemporary scholars, he added, are also ''interested in the process of language itself,'' that is, in the way in which words and sentence structure can distort meaning to fit ideological or political agendas.,Indeed, the current debate is as much about politics as it is about language. Dense, difficult writing is most often associated with newer academic fields like cultural studies, women's studies and ''queer theory.'' These fields often cast a critical eye on historic figures and received wisdoms, arguing that our understanding of the ''truth'' is really a function of who holds power at the moment.,Mr. Hexter says that an approach that opens Western values and history to attack is discomfiting to many people. ''One side of the culture wars thinks we should read texts that ennoble us and show the strength of our civilization,'' Mr. Hexter said. As Ms. Scott in Princeton argues, ''Things that are disturbing or critical or self-reflective are targets.'',Conservative critics like Sanford Pinsker, editor of Academic Questions, the journal of the National Association of Scholars, said that the subjects being studied by the post-modernists ''are hardly new.'',''People used to discuss their disagreements in plain English,'' he said. But now ''you set up a whole new world of language and these people say they're king or queen of it.'' That's why Mr. Pinsker insists the bad writing contest is ''a lot tougher than the Oscars,'' adding, ''There are just so many wonderful contributions by people with tin ears for the sound of language and no capacity for clarity of thinking.'',Of course, making fun of academic writing is part of a long tradition. As Mr. Hexter noted, none other than Socrates himself was attacked for the difficulty of his ideas. Even Aristophanes, in ''The Clouds,'' Mr. Hexter said, ''mocks Socrates for his technical language.''",DINITIA SMITH,"FEB. 27, 1999",When Ideas Get Lost in Bad Writing; Attacks on Scholars Include a Barbed Contest With 'Prizes',https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/when-ideas-get-lost-bad-writing-attacks-scholars-include-barbed-contest-with.html
"The Clinton Administration temporarily froze weapons sales to Greece this month because of suspicions that it had given secret NATO aircraft jamming codes to Russia, a Pentagon official said today.,The suspension of arms sales is likely to be lifted, however, because an investigation led by Army Maj. Gen. Henry A. Kievenaar Jr. concluded that the suspected transaction did not happen, a Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said.,''We did receive some information which we investigated and found there was not a problem,'' Mr. Bacon said. He said General Kievenaar returned from Athens on Thursday, and was briefing members of Congress on his findings.,The Washington Post, which is reporting the arms cutoff to Greece in its Saturday issue, said some members of Congress were not satisfied and wanted more details. A classified intelligence briefing by General Kievenaar was planned for Monday and Tuesday.,Nicholas Burns, the United States Ambassador to Greece, met six times with Greece's Defense Minister, Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, to emphasize the seriousness of Washington's concerns and press him to cooperate with the investigation, The Post said.,Mr. Tsokhatzopoulos did so, the newspaper said, ''throwing open the file cabinets'' and giving Mr. Kievenaar's team access to any documents they wanted to see and whomever they wanted to interview.,Mr. Bacon said the Pentagon initially suspected that Greece had provided Russia with NATO codes that would enable Russia to defeat strikes by NATO aircraft. In exchange, according to the original suspicion, Russia was to have supplied Greece with a radio jamming system known as the SPN-2, designed to interfere with the ability of NATO aircraft to deliver bombs or missiles accurately to their target.,Greece was said to have wanted the system to use against the combat jets supplied by the United States to Greece's archrival, Turkey, which is also a member of NATO.,''That never happened,'' Mr. Bacon said, citing the conclusions of Mr. Kievenaar's investigation.,In response to the allegation, the Clinton Administration earlier this month stopped issuing new licenses for the export of military or dual-use equipment to Greece. Mr. Bacon said it was likely, in light of Mr. Kievenaar's findings, that the ban would be lifted.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"FEB. 27, 1999",U.S. Is Said to Have Imposed Freeze on Arms Sales To Greece,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/us-is-said-to-have-imposed-freeze-on-arms-sales-to-greece.html
"President Clinton today certified Mexico and Colombia as fully cooperative allies in fighting illegal drugs, even though most hard drugs flooding the United States come from those countries.,The President's declaration illustrates the extent to which Washington's paramount interests, from regional stability to trade, influence its annual assessment of the drug threat posed by foreign countries.,On Capitol Hill, two Senators who led a failed attempt last year to overturn Mexico's certification dropped their opposition, and the House Speaker, Dennis Hastert, signaled that he was not seeking a fight with the Administration over the issue.,The Senators, Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, were muted compared with their demeanor last year.,They joined six Republicans in sending a letter today to Mr. Clinton urging the White House to incorporate new standards for evaluating Mexico's cooperation, including prosecution of the leaders of smuggling operations and extradition of traffickers wanted in the United States.,''The Government of Mexico has taken steps to improve its law enforcement cooperation,'' the letter said. ''But far more, we believe, needs to be done.'',Senate aides said there was little chance that opponents of certification could muster a majority to reverse Mr. Clinton's decision, much less a two-thirds vote to override a Presidential veto of any reversal.,Senators Feinstein and Coverdell had other reasons for avoiding a fight over drug policy. Ms. Feinstein, her aides say, does not believe that a divisive floor battle would be fruitful. Mr. Coverdell is the chairman of a United States-Mexico legislative conference in Atlanta this spring and does not want to anger the Mexicans taking part.,The Administration's decision is likely to run into sharper opposition in the House, where a Florida Republican, Representative John L. Mica, is to hold hearings next week. ''I'm hearing more and more members of Congress express dismay about Mexico's performance,'' said Mr. Mica, who predicted that the Administration was ''in for a very rough time on Capitol Hill.'',The Administration refused certification to only two countries, Afghanistan and Myanmar, formerly Burma, which together supply 90 percent of the world's opium.,In theory, decertification disqualifies a country from receiving American economic aid or multilateral development loans. But Washington already has frosty relations with Afghanistan and Myanmar and provides no direct aid.,Four other countries -- Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay -- were judged not to have done enough to stanch the drugs smuggled through their territory. But sanctions against all of them were waived in the American national interest, largely because of their political and economic fragility in moving toward democratic rule.,Although Haiti has become a significant shipment point for cocaine and other drugs smuggled into the United States, the State Department said the sanctions mandated by decertification would mean eliminating American programs propping up the battered Haitian economy.,''All of us are deeply concerned about that country's deteriorating situation,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said today at the briefing announcing the certification decisions.,Twenty-two other countries identified with drug production or trafficking were certified by Washington on the grounds that their governments were grappling with the problem. They include Pakistan, which reduced opium cultivation by 26 percent last year, and Peru and Bolivia, where cultivation of coca leaf, the raw ingredient for cocaine, fell 26 percent and 17 percent respectively.,Mexico remains the primary transport route for Colombian cocaine smuggled into the United States, as well as a major source of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine and a center for laundering drug money, according to the annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report released today by the State Department.",CHRISTOPHER S.

"In a troubling decision this week, the Supreme Court granted immigration officials virtual carte blanche to target illegal aliens for deportation based on their lawful political associations and activities. The case involved eight non-citizens who the Government conceded had been targeted for deportation proceedings because of their leafletting, speaking, fund-raising and other political activities in support of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the Government regards as a terrorist organization.,Lower courts had supported the aliens' claim that they were being subjected to selective prosecution. Others with similar technical visa problems were left alone. None of the eight had been accused of committing any crime, or engaging in any violent or terrorist activities. The F.B.I. concluded that if they had been U.S. citizens, there would be no basis for their arrest.,A year ago, a unanimous Federal appellate panel in California ruled that the deportations could not proceed without a showing of specific intent to further the Palestinian group's illegal ends. Overturning that ruling, the justices, by an 8-to-1 vote, held that a 1996 law designed to speed deportations barred Federal courts from assuming jurisdiction in deportation cases until the administrative process had been concluded and there was a final order of deportation. The practical result in some cases will be to prevent meaningful judicial review.,Unfortunately, the justices did not stop there. A slimmer, 6-to-3 majority pronounced that illegal aliens had no First Amendment right not to be singled out for removal because of their political activities and beliefs. This pronouncement runs counter to the general trend of according aliens the same due process and First Amendment rights as citizens. When the Court agreed to hear the case last spring, it said it would review only the jurisdictional issue. The parties were told not to argue the more fundamental First Amendment questions. Handing down major rulings without fully exploring the arguments is not a way to produce thoughtful decision-making by the nation's top judges.,The Court's rationale could bar Federal Court intervention to block deportations based on an immigrant's ties to any group or cause out of favor with the Government. The inevitable result will be to chill the free-speech rights not just of illegal immigrants, but also of legal immigrants awaiting final confirmation of their status. That is not an outcome that the Court, or the nation, can feel proud about.",,"FEB. 27, 1999",Unjust Deportations,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/opinion/unjust-deportations.html

The union said 50 members had been working for the contractor and were dismissed. A spokesman for Golden Mark disputed the union's figures, saying that there were 31 workers, 29 of whom had been rehired.,Union employees said they were ordered to clean out their lockers on Wednesday and, if they wished, to re-apply for their jobs at a Golden Mark office across the street.,''We were told that our services were no longer needed and that we had to get out of the building,'' said Michael Colon, 37, who has worked as a handyman at the mall for 10 years and under the union contract earned $17 an hour.,Howard J.

''Golden Mark says they pay decent wages,'' Mr. Rubenstein said.,But members of the union local, which represents 55,000 doormen, janitors, repairmen and elevator operators who work in 4,000 office and apartment buildings, disagreed.,''It's time for us to draw the line,'' Thomas Balanoff, who was appointed the local's trustee by the parent union, bellowed into a bullhorn to the hundreds of members who demonstrated support for the ousted workers. ''This is a new day for 32 B-J.'',Mr. Balanoff pledged to continue the union's more aggressive tactics in the coming weeks.

''They were incredible, even if they were against me. My game fell apart.'',The match reopened wounds from the Australian Open, when Hingis described the muscular Mauresmo as ''half a man'' and joked about Mauresmo's off-the-court appearances with her girlfriend. Mauresmo acknowledged at the Australian Open that she is a lesbian.,Although Hingis and Mauresmo played down the episode in the days before today's match, the crowd was in no mood to forget. The fans cheered the 19-year-old Frenchwoman, drawing requests from the umpire for quiet. They waved banners that read, ''We love you Amelie'' and ''We're behind you Amelie.'' They hissed at the 18-year-old Hingis during introductions and booed every time she hit the ball in warm-ups.,Hingis had beaten Mauresmo by 6-2, 6-3 in the Australian final, and after taking the first set in 24 minutes today, it appeared a similar result awaited.

"When Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew declared this week that he would require summer classes for failing students in the third, sixth and eighth grades, he said he was trying to change ''the mind-set'' in the New York City public schools. But New York has gone down this road before.,It was just 16 years ago that the city effectively abandoned its last great experiment in mandatory summer school in the lower grades, imposed with as much fanfare -- and some of the same lofty goals -- as Dr. Crew's plan. Under Frank J. Macchiarola, who was Chancellor when Edward I. Koch was Mayor, thousands of failing fourth and seventh graders were ordered to attend summer school, and many were held back for failing to complete it successfully.,That program fell victim to budget cuts, shifting priorities and changing chancellors. After Mr. Macchiarola left office in 1983, his successors left it to the discretion of the 32 community school boards. Most let mandatory summer school wither, though even today a handful of elementary schools require it for some students. (High school is a different story; students who fail a required course must pass it in the summer or risk being held back.),But if mandatory summer school did not work then, why will it work now? And is it guaranteed to outlast Dr. Crew, who has said he will not stay after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani leaves office in 2000 or 2001?,Experts and school officials, asked those questions over the past few days, said there were no guarantees. But they added that the conditions for required summer school were much more favorable now than in the early 80's.,For one thing, the Chancellor has more power. Under the school governance law passed by the Legislature in 1996, he can hire and fire district superintendents, who used to report to school boards. Dr. Crew has said superintendents, principals and teachers must be held accountable for a child's ability to read.,Second, Dr. Crew plans to put mechanisms in place to insure that summer school will continue.,In recent years, for example, there was no single standard for requiring a student to take summer classes. Now Dr. Crew says the central administration will not only set the standards but will also determine which students qualify and even send out the mailing labels and sample letters for local superintendents to pass on to parents.,''I'm trying to iron out what used to be, for the most part, idiosyncratic,'' the Chancellor said. ''I'm trying to say, here's the threshold, here's the yardstick and here's what happens. I think we've got to be able to be consistent.'',Perhaps most important, the experts said, what Dr. Crew called the mind-set has genuinely changed since the 80's.,Summer school is more popular than ever, with 200,000 students in last year's mostly voluntary programs -- half of them in middle school or below. (School officials estimate that 52,000 third, sixth and eighth graders will qualify for mandatory summer classes, based on their performance on last year's standardized tests.) Rigorous standards are more popular, too, and ''social promotion'' -- the practice of letting children move to the next grade whether or not they have mastered the material -- has seldom been so unpopular.,Marshall S. Smith, the Federal Deputy Education Secretary, said Dr. Crew's summer school proposal was perfectly in keeping with President Clinton's recent calls to end social promotion because the plan offered students an alternative to being retained in their previous grade.,''What the President is saying is that we don't believe in social promotion or retention,'' Mr. Smith said. ''What we believe in is having children achieve high standards.'',Dr. Crew has recommended the elimination of social promotion beginning in the spring of 2000. The Board is to vote on the recommendation.,For Frank Macchiarola, who was Chancellor from 1978 to 1983 and is now president of St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights, the new commitment to summer school restores his faith in a program he always thought was too hastily abandoned.,By the time he left office, he said this week, the program was starting to work. After its second full year, in the spring of 1982, for example, 6,200 fourth graders were told they were being held back because of their reading scores. After six weeks in summer school, 27 percent, or 1,700, had improved enough to move on to the fifth grade. Of the 4,500 who had to repeat a grade, 71 percent, or 3,200, passed the fourth-grade test the following year and moved on.,Though Mr. Macchiarola's successor, Anthony J. Alvarado, retained the program with minor modifications, his tenure lasted barely a year. In 1987, a Board of Education study commissioned by Mr. Alvarado's successor, Nathan Quinones, reported that the program was not working because students were getting few, if any, educational or social services to help them maintain the gains they might have made. In 1990, Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez canceled the program.,This week, Mr. Macchiarola said he felt vindicated. ''If you mean to be serious about summer school, it will work,'' he said. ''If you don't mean to be serious, you will say there are no social services, etc.,''For a long period of time after I was Chancellor, there was an interruption in the desire to have standards in place. I listened to the President in the State of the Union address repeat the kinds of programs that we advocated when I took over in 1987. It's taken 20 years for what was good city policy to become national policy.''",LYNETTE HOLLOWAY,"FEB. 27, 1999","Summer School Has Failed Before, but Conditions Are Now More Favorable",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/nyregion/summer-school-has-failed-before-but-conditions-are-now-more-favorable.html
"A giant bronze statue of a Native American with his eyes half closed and his head turned peacefully toward the heavens sits outside the main entrance to the state capitol here.,The statue, ''Morning Prayer,'' is a serene prelude to a struggle inside the building, where the Legislature and local tribes are at odds over the state's claim to a share of the money that comes from Indian casinos.,In a state where the issue of Indian casinos has been a contentious one for years, some tribes are defying a two-year-old agreement that requires them to pay 16 percent of casino revenues to the state. The agreement, tribal leaders contend, was forced on them by legislators.,If the Legislature does not lower the revenue-sharing to an amount that both sides agree to, tribal leaders say, the Indians will cut off all payments to the state and sue. And with legislation pending that would shut down all the casinos if the tribes refused to share the money, the two sides appear headed for a showdown.,''The Legislature is making a grave mistake by not negotiating,'' said George Rivera, the Lieutenant Governor of the Pojoaque Pueblo tribe, which operates the Cities of Gold casino, 15 miles north of Santa Fe. Mr. Rivera and other tribal leaders want the state to lower its take to about 8 percent.,''They're playing a game to see how much money they can force out of the tribes,'' he said.,With 11 of the state's 22 tribes operating casinos on reservations,  and annual revenues of about $350 million, the stakes are high.,Looking out toward the Sandia Mountains and the pale mustard and sage mesa that surrounds the 27-hole championship golf course that his tribe has developed, Roy Montoya, the chief administrator of the Santa Ana Pueblo, sounded as if he still could not believe how much gambling -- in just six or seven years -- has reversed the fortune of the tribe's 690 members. With its modern adobe-style casino, the golf course, a nursery and garden center, a clothing company and a restaurant, the tribe provides jobs to more than 400 people on its reservation.,''It's provided a lot of income to the tribe that we never had before,'' Mr. Montoya said. ''In fact, we had no income.'',The state, too, appreciates the money. If the two sides fail to reach an agreement, New Mexico stands to lose $32 million to $52 million a year from the casinos.,The Federal Government requires tribes seeking to operate casinos to sign compacts with their state governments. In 1995, the New Mexico tribes signed a compact with Gov. Gary E. Johnson that called for the state to get 5 percent of the revenues.  Although both sides appeared content with the arrangement, opponents of gambling contested it in court, charging that Governor Johnson, a Republican now in his second term, could not enter into such a compact without the approval of the  Legislature. The state Supreme Court ruled the compact invalid, but  the casinos continued to operate.,The Legislature, in 1997, finally passed a bill that formally legalized the casinos and established a compact calling for 16 percent of the revenues to be paid to the state. Although such revenue-sharing agreements are common around the United States, the Federal Government does not allow a state to impose a tax on the casinos, which is what the tribes here say has happened. The tribes signed the compact but said they did so to avoid being shut down. Some tribes have paid the 16 percent under protest. Some have continued to pay 5 percent; others have refused to pay anything. The state has collected about $32 million from the casinos each of the past two years, legislative officials said.,George Buffett, a Republican who has served as a state representative for 21 years and has opposed legalizing casino gambling, chafes at the notion that the Native Americans were forced into their compact.,''Sixteen percent is not too high when they already don't pay income taxes,'' said Mr. Buffett, an Albuquerque businessman.,''They signed the contract,'' he added. ''They said they would pay.'',In an effort to resolve the conflict before the current legislative session ends in late March, State Senator Manny M. Aragon has sponsored a bill that would lower the revenue-sharing to 10 percent, but would also shut down all casinos if tribes continued to refuse to pay. The bill passed the Senate this week, but an identical bill in the House is languishing in committee. Tribal leaders say the 10 percent is too high, and they have thrown their weight behind a House bill that would require them to give 8 percent to the state. That bill, sponsored by one of the five Native Americans in the state Legislature, is considered to have no chance in the Senate because an identical bill was already tossed out.,''The likelihood of nothing passing has risen,'' said Mr. Aragon, a Democrat who has supported tribal casinos. ''This has strained my relationship with my Native American friends. The problem is that they think the percentage is too high and they never had a chance to negotiate. There is some validity to what they say.'',For now, the tribes are looking at another development that they say further undermines their ability to share their revenues with the state. This week, New Mexico's first non-Indian casino opened at a horse-racing track along the southern border. With other non-Indian casinos scheduled to open at racetracks and social halls in the coming year, the tribes point out that they do not have the kind of exclusive casino environment that tribes around the country enjoy.,''Now that other entities in the state have slot machines,'' Mr. Rivera said, ''the exclusivity goes out of the window.''",BRETT PULLEY,"FEB. 27, 1999",Statehouse Journal; New Mexico and Tribes Quarrel Over Casinos,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/statehouse-journal-new-mexico-and-tribes-quarrel-over-casinos.html
"The New York City Board of Education and New York State, acting under the terms of a lawsuit settlement reached this week, will more closely monitor the placement of disabled preschoolers so that more of them are taught in standard classes, officials said yesterday.,The lawsuit, filed in 1994 in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on behalf of six disabled students, contended that thousands of disabled preschoolers were automatically sent to classes made up entirely of disabled students -- ''segregated settings'' where they did not get the same level of education as general-education students. This practice, the suit asserted, violated state and Federal mandates that require school officials whenever possible to place disabled preschoolers in ''integrated settings.'',Since the suit was filed, the state and city have enacted a series of reforms that have been reducing the number of students in segregated settings, spokesmen for the state and city as well as lawyers for the plaintiffs said yesterday.,The settlement on Thursday, overseen by Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, largely sets up monitoring by lawyers for the plaintiffs and the state in an effort to insure compliance, said Roger Juan Maldonado, a lawyer who worked on the suit with Advocates for Children, a nonprofit group.,Since 1975, the Federal Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act has guaranteed children as young as 3 the right to free and appropriate education in the least restrictive settings, leaving it up to the states to carry out the programs.,Most preschoolers with disabilities have relatively mild difficulties like speech impairments, but the program also includes the severely handicapped and mentally retarded. To the extent possible, state regulations say, pupils who do not require special treatment should receive their services as part of regular day care or nursery school or at home.  ''If you have a child with a speech impediment you do not have to put him in a classroom of kids all of whom have speech impediments,'' Mr. Maldonado said. ''They might benefit when the rest of the kids don't have a speech impediment because they might learn from them by mimicking them.'',More children are being mixed in with their general-education peers, according to the state, which enacted a law in 1996 that effectively required school districts to play a larger role in evaluating and referring children for treatment. Previously, private agencies handled much of that task, and critics say it drove up enrollments and costs.,The state's preschool education program for disabled students grew from 18,000 students, at a cost of $226 million, in 1989 to 55,730 in 1995, costing $600 million. Of the approximately 20,000 3- and 4-year-olds with disabilities in New York City in the 1997-98 school year, 76 percent were not in general-education classes, compared with 84 percent the year before, according to a state report released last month. The report did not include the costs, which a state official said yesterday were still being collected.,The settlement requires the state to collect more data on where the students were placed and to spell out guidelines more clearly for referring students to segregated programs.",RANDAL C.

"Stanley Dance, a jazz critic, Ellington specialist and record producer, died on Tuesday at the Remington Club in Rancho Bernardo, Calif. He was 88 and lived in Vista, Calif.,Mr. Dance is perhaps best known as a member of Duke Ellington's close-knit group of friends, and for nearly 70 years was one of Ellington's main interpreters. They met in 1933 at an Ellington concert in London, forming a friendship that lasted until Ellington's death in 1974. Mr. Dance delivered the eulogy at Ellington's funeral at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.,During Ellington's trips to England, he was a regular guest in the Dance family home in Braintree, outside London. Mr. Dance met his wife, Helen, at the office of Ellington's agent, Irving Mills. After moving to the United States in 1959, Mr. Dance traveled regularly with Ellington, wrote numerous sets of liner notes and essays about the music and helped Ellington with his autobiography, ''Music Is My Mistress.'',After serving in the British Army during World War II, Mr. Dance began producing records. In 1958 Felsted records sent him to the United States to record for it, and he took back sessions that included dates by Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines and others. Over the years he produced record dates for English Columbia, French RCA and Black Lion records, often with members of the Duke Ellington orchestra.,After moving to the United States, he began writing concise, well-argued essays and reviews for The New York Herald Tribune, Saturday Review, Jazz Review, Downbeat and other publications. He also began writing a series of books for Scribners that included ''The World of Swing,'' ''The World of Duke Ellington,'' ''The World of Count Basie'' and ''The World of Earl Hines,'' along with biographies of Charlie Barnett and Ellington. He won a Grammy for his 1963 liner notes for the recording ''The Ellington Era'' (Columbia).,In addition to his wife, he is survived by their children, Theresa Dance-Bennink of Omemee, Ontario; Rupert Dance of Hopkinton, N.H.;  Francis Dance of Woodbury, Conn., and Maria Lindley of Carlsbad, Calif.",PETER WATROUS,"FEB. 27, 1999","Stanley Dance, 88, Jazz Critic And Expert on Duke Ellington",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/stanley-dance-88-jazz-critic-and-expert-on-duke-ellington.html
"Gaurav and Rohan Juneja were going at one another on a squash court at the Ferris Athletic Center on the Trinity College campus as if India's national singles championship was at stake.  In fact, the identical twins, who are highly ranked juniors in India, could someday play for the championship in their homeland, but this high-spirited match between the freshmen was only for the entertainment of their teammates on the Trinity varsity, which some have hailed as the greatest college squash team ever.,Hyperbole aside, little Trinity has stolen this season's thunder from Harvard, Yale and Princeton, which have dominated collegiate squash for more than six decades.,And this weekend Trinity can put an exclamation point on its undefeated season by becoming the first non-Ivy League school in 32 years to win the national collegiate team championship at Harvard. Yesterday Trinity advanced to the semifinals by beating Williams, 9-0, and will face Princeton today. Harvard and Yale are in the other semifinal.,''Playing one another in practice brings out the worst in each other,'' Rohan Juneja said recently. ''We're ready to kill each other.'',That could be because Rohan is Trinity's No. 8 player, while Gaurav is No. 9 and anxious to move up.,The Junejas, who are 18 years old, finished the regular season unbeaten. But then all but two of Trinity's 20 varsity squash players went through the regular season unbeaten as the Bantams won all 14 of their team matches, 12 of them by 9-0 shutouts.,The Bantams have lost only 2 of 128 matches, while dropping only 9 of 338 games. Each singles match is a three-of-five-game series in this fast-paced, highly aerobic sport played on a four-walled court.,Trinity has already been crowned the regular-season champion, but that should make the Bantams even hungrier for the national team title. Last season's Trinity team went 16-1 and won the regular-season title, but then lost to Harvard in the finals of the national team tournament.,This season Coach Paul Assaiante has assembled such a powerhouse that the only competition in this weekend's 40-team tournament may be for second place.,''I knew Trinity was very good,'' said Dave Talbott, the Yale coach, after the Bantams had beaten the Bulldogs, by 20 matches to none in an expanded dual match, ''but I though we'd win at least a couple of matches. I think they're the best team that's ever been put out there.'',How did Trinity, a Division III school with 1,846 students, get so good? Assaiante took Evan Dobelle, the school's president, at his word when he told his coaches that he wanted every one of the school's teams to be a winner in order to get Trinity greater exposure. So, the coach went after -- and got -- some of the world's best young squash players.,''When Evan looked around to see where he could make the biggest dent quickest, he saw it was in squash, where we have traditionally had winning teams,'' the 48-year-old Assaiante said. ''So he said, 'Let's go for it, but without sacrificing academic principles.' And we haven't since all of our seven foreign players are very good students.'',In fact, seven of Assaiante's top nine players are foreigners. Not that Trinity's foreign accent is unique; this season Harvard and Yale have five foreign players each while Princeton has four.,Trinity's best player is Marcus Cowie, a junior from Norfolk, England. He is the two-time national intercollegiate singles champion.,At No. 2 is Akhil Behl, the men's champion in India. One of four Indians on the team, Behl transferred to Trinity in September from the University of Bombay. Preston Quick, a two-time first-team all-American from Lakewood, Colo., is No. 3, down one notch from last season.,''The competition in practice is harder than in our matches,'' Ragontse said. ''Everybody goes all-out.'',That is bad news for Trinity's competition. For as Talbott of Yale replied when asked if anyone could beat the Bantams, ''Only if their van runs off the road while they're on the way to a match.''",JACK CAVANAUGH,"FEB. 27, 1999",SQUASH; Trinity Seems a Lock For National Team Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/sports/squash-trinity-seems-a-lock-for-national-team-title.html
"WHEN Bill Cosby gets involved in something, I generally trust it; when George Steinbrenner gets involved, I generally suspect it. So this week's merger between the Yankees and Nets, creating the YankeeNets, has forced me to confront a curious amalgam of trust and doubt.,The merger is striking for its incongruity. Cosby purchased a small share of the Nets last month, largely because of his attraction to the team's commitment to the Community Youth Organization. Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz took over the Nets in late October for $150 million. Their 38 percent ownership belongs to a charitable trust that has said it will funnel profits toward New Jersey inner-city youth programs.,All profits the trust earns will be dedicated to minority education and children in Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Camden and Trenton. The C.Y.O. will remain in place and will own 20 percent of the YankeeNets.,Katz is a friend of Cosby's from college, when they attended Temple University. The YankeeNets is an innovative, no, an altruistic merger -- potentially, an ingenious merger -- which could produce a gigantic entertainment entity. The YankeeNets -- a definitive agreement that has not been signed, but which has a signed letter of intent to form the company -- could capitalize on everything from Yankee soda and cafes to a new sports cable channel.,Already the move has put the woeful Nets on the real map. The business and sports community is infinitely curious why the Yankees, one of the most storied franchises in sports history, would merge with the Nets (2-9), an organization that has been noted for its lack of direction and leadership.,The YankeeNets deal is such an odd variation on the spate of corporate mergers and acquisitions that no one knows what it means and what precedents it sets in a feverish battle among corporations to dominate the global airwaves.,For all the unanswered questions, there is a point at which the Katz-Cosby altruism and the Steinbrenner capitalism meet at the good, old-fashioned Yankee bottom line -- that the trust, for all its lofty goals, will not generate much money unless the Nets make operating profits. In other words, just win, baby. Team officials feel that a stable Nets lineup and a new arena in Newark will push the team into the black.,Toward that end, the Nets signed Jayson Williams to a seven-year, $100 million contract, with the idea of making him a centerpiece for the C.Y.O. project. Also toward that end, heads may have to roll, if only to salvage lives. Nets Coach John Calipari, a survivor if ever there was one, instinctively grasps how all of this YankeeNets and C.Y.O. business affects his No. 1 priority -- his continued tenure as head coach.,Calipari used Steinbrenner's name yesterday afternoon when someone asked if he was concerned about job security. ''I'm not at all thinking in those terms,'' he said confidently.,Then he smiled and added, ''That may have come up because Mr. Steinbrenner is part of our group now.'',If Steinbrenner were the principal owner of the Nets, Calipari would have already received a visit or two at the new training center. Steinbrenner would have reminded his brash young coach that the Nets weren't the only team hit by injuries, weren't the only team playing games on consecutive nights. He would have told Coach Cal that for all his talk about the Nets' playoff performance, his team was swept by the Bulls in the first round last season.,And now the Nets are in turmoil. Fortunately for Calipari, the season is young and the Nets' principal owners are altruists.,But is the coach making satisfactory progress toward his National Basketball Association degree? What I remember most about the Nets-Bulls post-season series was how Michael Jordan glared at Calipari periodically as the coach ranted and raved on the sideline. Pat Riley can berate; Phil Jackson can berate; Lenny Wilkens and Chuck Daly can berate. Calipari might have to devise a new strategy.,Chris Gatling requested a trade on Wednesday, which may have been the first indication that players are burning out. Calipari admitted yesterday that this was the first time in his coaching career that players were not playing up to their potential. ''That's what bothers me,'' Calipari said. ''I've always been able to get guys to play well.'',Three years ago, Calipari ended his introductory news conference by restating his confidence in himself. ''I'm betting on me,'' he said.,That was before the YankeeNets. The stakes have just been raised.",WILLIAM C.

"AS soon as his birdie putt plopped into the cup on the 15th hole, Jeff Maggert was suddenly 2 up. Without a glance at Tiger Woods, the 35-year-old touring pro with only one victory in his nine years on the PGA Tour turned and strode toward the 16th tee.,''C'mon, Tiger,'' a voice in the gallery yelled, ''don't make us watch basketball on Sunday.'',But when Woods soon lost, 2 and 1, on the 17th green, the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship was assured of diminished ratings for tomorrow's 36-hole final on the ABC network, as well as diminished credibility for the first of three World Golf Championship tournaments this year.,Theatrically, the dream final would have had Woods, who is No. 1 in the world ranking, against David Duval, who is No. 2. Or least Woods or Duval against any of the other marquee names -- Mark O'Meara, Davis Love 3d or Ernie Els.,But with Woods and all of the world's other top 10 players already home for the weekend, this tournament has dissolved into just another PGA Tour stop that is almost instantly forgettable.,The Andersen Consulting promoters had hoped this match play event would at least approach ''major'' status. But it won't now. Not even with $1 million to the winner out of the $5 million bonanza.,Mere money is never enough to, and you'll pardon the expression, match the history of the four major tournaments -- the Masters, the United States Open, the British Open and the Professional Golfers' Association Championship.,But if Woods or Duval or O'Meara or Love or Els had won here, this event would have earned a measure of respect as an important tournament -- because a top golfer won it.,Instead, the World Golf Championship promoters have only themselves, alias the vagaries of match play, to blame for the upsets that have created a 36-hole yawn between the survivors of today's semifinals involving four longtime but dull-time American touring pros -- Jeff Maggert versus Steve Pate and Andrew Magee versus John Huston.,Considering their respective world ranking, the semifinals involve No. 24 (Maggert) versus No. 61 (Pate) and No. 50 (Magee) versus No. 27 (Huston). None of the four has ever won a major.,That's not what the World Golf Championship had in mind when it created this match play event. And when Maggert went 1 up on Woods with a birdie on the 541-yard 12th hole, that's not what the displayer of a huge homemade banner on a nearby house had in mind. ''Tiger's Championship,'' the blue-and-white banner read.,Blue indeed for Tiger Woods. Bluer than the sky on this soft, sunny southern California afternoon. Woods, the 23-year-old native of nearby Cypress, Calif., could not do what he was famous for doing in match play as the three-time United States Amateur champion: coming from behind to win.,In his three 36-hole United States Amateur finals, with Trip Kuehne, Buddy Mariucci and Steve Scott, Woods trailed, once by as much as six down to Kuehne, but he rallied each time.,But this was not a 36-hole United States Amateur final; this was an 18-hole match against Maggert, a hardened pro with a 4-3 record in Ryder Cup matches.,''When you get the top 64 players in the world and you give them just one round of golf, anything can happen,'' Woods said. ''I think if you would make 36-hole matches, then I think you're going to see the better player come out on top. Then again, playing 36-hole matches would wear you out a little bit.'',Because of his awesome length off the tee, Woods usually has an advantage on the par-5 holes, but on the four par-5 holes at the La Costa Resort and Spa in their quarterfinal, Maggert was 1 up. And after going 2 up on the third hole, Woods did not win another hole. He had no bogeys but only three birdies.,''I didn't think Jeff would give me an opening unless I applied enough pressure,'' Woods said. ''If I was to make two or three birdies in a row and really put a lot of heat on him, then I could see him possibly hitting one errant shot. But I wasn't able to do that. I didn't hit enough good shots close to the hole.'',And no matter who the winner is now, this Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship will not hit enough good shots close to the stature of a major.",DAVE ANDERSON,"FEB. 27, 1999",Sports of The Times; 'Don't Make Us Watch Basketball',https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-don-t-make-us-watch-basketball.html
"Only a day after announcing a proposed merger between the Yankees and the Nets, the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, was once again dragging out a famously unfulfilled threat to move his baseball team to New Jersey.,''Now that we have our new partners from New Jersey,'' he said through a spokesman, ''our interest in going to New Jersey is much stronger.'',But Mr. Steinbrenner may no longer hold the high card in the 13-year-old poker game over a future home for the team, whether in Lyndhurst, N.J., Manhattan or the Bronx. All signs indicate that the team will remain at its historic home on 161st Street.,Politicians in New Jersey are increasingly growing cool to the idea of wooing the Yankees, and Mr. Steinbrenner's planned new partners, the Nets owners, hope to lure state financing for a new basketball arena in Newark and would not want the Yankees to be lobbying for state money for a new baseball stadium at the same time, politicians and business executives said.,''It essentially means that George will stay in the Bronx,'' said a New Jersey business executive who has been briefed on the Nets-Yankees alliance and on various plans for the Meadowlands sports complex, where the Nets now play, but intend to leave. ''The entire universe has ruled out the West Side of Manhattan, and the Meadowlands doesn't work for the Nets group.'',In New York, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has dropped the idea for a billion-dollar stadium on the West Side and, according to a top City Hall official, has begun exploring plans for a new stadium in the Bronx as part of an urban rehabilitation plan. The team's lease at Yankee Stadium, which is owned by the city, expires in 2002.,Gov. George E. Pataki has long favored keeping the Yankees in the Bronx. And for the past four months, Mr. Steinbrenner has held secret talks with Representative Charles B. Rangel and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development about a new or renovated stadium in the Bronx.,In New Jersey, the Nets are pursuing state support for a new arena in Newark. The arena would be privately financed, but according to the executive who was briefed on the Yankees-Nets merger, the politically connected owners of the Nets would want millions of dollars in transportation improvements from the state. It is unlikely, said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, that the state would also contribute toward a stadium in the Meadowlands or in nearby Lyndhurst.,That view was borne out by political analysts and New Jersey executives who said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was no longer interested in chasing the Yankees or in building a stadium in the Meadowlands.,''Despite the impending marriage between the Nets and the Yankees,'' said Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, ''the Governor believes that unless and until the Yankees tell her they want to move to New Jersey the team ought to play in the House That Ruth Built, in the Bronx.'',Back across the river, Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said he believed that the pending partnership between the two teams bodes well for the Bronx.,''This merger tells me the Yankees are committed to staying in the Bronx,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''Undoubtedly, they'll want improvements. The Governor and I have always said that we would look to be helpful.'',But Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner, the Nets and the proposed group, YankeeNets, insisted that the proposed merger with the Nets ''certainly makes New Jersey a potential location.'' He noted that ''the Nets ownership has deep roots in that state.'' The West Side of Manhattan and the Bronx are also options, he said. Mr. Steinbrenner has repeatedly threatened to move out of the Bronx since 1986, citing problems with parking, traffic and crime.,''Steinbrenner has not made up his mind as to which location the Yankees will seek,'' Mr. Rubenstein said yesterday. ''There have been discussions about rebuilding the entire area around the Bronx location and a new stadium. That will be considered by the Yankees as they make their decision.'',The Yankees and the Nets recently signed a letter of intent to create YankeeNets, an equal partnership that would work on the sale of tickets, luxury boxes, advertising and cable television rights for both teams. As part of the deal, the Nets group, which is headed by Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz, would contribute at least $350 million to YankeeNets from outside investors.,The talks between the owners of the two teams began in earnest shortly after Thanksgiving, when Mr. Steinbrenner's negotiations to sell a majority stake in the Yankees to Cablevision broke down. Cablevision's 12-year, $486 million contract to broadcast Yankee games was coming to an end and the company was eager to either buy control of the team or quickly renegotiate a contract. Cablevision has had little contact with Mr. Steinbrenner for about two months, although the company retains a strong interest in renewing the cable contract.,At the same time, Mr. Steinbrenner has had a series of meetings with Mr. Rangel and others concerning a new or rehabilitated stadium in the Bronx, as well as a plan for rehabilitating the neighborhood. Mr. Rangel, in turn, has talked with city and state officials as well as H.U.D.,''There is a unique opportunity to do something big and dramatic in the Bronx because of the desire by the city, the state and Federal representatives like Rangel to do something in the Bronx,'' said Vincent Tese, who negotiated a short-lived deal with the Yankees in 1987. ''Whether it's rehabilitating the stadium or putting up a new one in the park next door, it could be the project of a decade. New Jersey at this point is dead and moving to New Jersey would hurt the value of the franchise.''",CHARLES V.

"The language was harsh, the country's emotional, cathartic response even stronger. A nine-volume report issued by a truth commission on Thursday that blamed the Guatemalan military for the deaths of nearly 200,000 people in their 36-year civil war surprised nearly everyone with the bluntness and severity of its judgments and recommendations.,For the human rights advocates and victims' relatives who had long feared an official whitewash, that was a most gratifying result.,But for the high command of the Guatemalan military and their civilian allies, who had for years sought to gut and impede the commission and its work, the outcome was ominous, a shock that weakens their political standing and leaves them open to prosecution.,Especially important was the commission's conclusion that from 1981 to 1983, ''agents of the state committed acts of genocide against groups of the Mayan people.'',The destruction of more than 400 Indian villages at that time and the slaughter of their inhabitants, the commission also determined, ''came about with the knowledge, or by order, of the highest military authorities.'',Such a finding provides an avenue to file criminal charges against top military and other Government officials who thought that they would  escape prosecution, thanks to an amnesty that the Guatemalan Congress approved in December 1996. That measure, condemned by human rights groups, forbids the prosecution of anyone who committed political offenses in the war.,Genocide, however, was a crime that does not fall under the amnesty, because it is not considered a political offense. As the commission report put it, ''the aggressive, racist and extremely cruel nature'' of the military's depredations in the countryside ''resulted in the extermination of defenseless Mayan communities.'',The most egregious offender, the report makes clear without condemning him by name, was Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who as head of the Government from March 1982 to mid-1983 pursued a scorched-earth policy.,After the British detained Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile in the fall, calls in Guatemala for General Rios Montt to be held accountable for his administration's actions mounted, even though he is apparently protected by amnesties approved in the 1980's.,From the start, the truth commission, formally the Commission for Historical Clarification, was intended to be ineffectual. The only way that the military would agree to its establishment at all, back in 1994 during negotiations on the topic, was on the condition that the final report not name or blame specific individuals for violations of human rights.,But when the commission began operations in 1997, just after the signing of the comprehensive peace settlement that ended the war, the Government, which still had military officers in place as advisers to President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and running the intelligence service, provided virtually no financial support. In a further effort to make the commission ineffectual, its investigators were initially told that they had six months to prepare their report.,But donations from foreign sources, primarily the United States Agency for International Development, allowed the commission and its German director, Christian Tomuschat, to open regional offices and cast a much wider net. The huge volume of material gathered enabled investigators, much to the annoyance of the military, to extend the mandate for nearly two years.,It is still too early to tell how Guatemala as a society will respond to the judgments, some of which had never been uttered in public before.,This is a presidential election year, and the issues are certain to be debated on the campaign trail, undoubtedly to the discomfort of General Rios Montt's Guatemalan Republican Front, which narrowly lost the presidency in a runoff four years ago and thinks that its chances this time are just as good.,The 1996 amnesty and peace agreement do permit individuals to bring charges against military officers or guerrilla leaders whom they believe committed murder, rape, torture and other abuses. Though the panel report cannot be used to lodge such accusations, human rights and religious groups have been compiling files on the most notorious of the more than 600 massacres for which the military is blamed, and they are widely expected to act soon.,But progress on emblematic human rights cases, like the massacre of a Mayan community at Xaman in 1995 and the murder of a well-known anthropologist, Myrna Mack, who was investigating genocide by the military, has been painfully slow.,The judicial system has been criticized by rights groups and the United Nations as corrupt and inefficient, and judges have been reluctant in the past to take on such cases.",LARRY ROHTER,"FEB. 27, 1999",Searing Indictment,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/searing-indictment.html

"Ever since the Senate brought President Clinton's impeachment trial to an end on Feb. 12 by voting for his acquittal, some voices from church and state have been calling for national healing.,Two weeks ago, for example, the Rev. H. George Anderson, Presiding Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which has 5.2 million members, issued a plea for prayers for reconciliation.,And on Thursday, one senator suggested that it might be good to hold a national day of reconciliation, emphasizing a coming together of not just political opponents but also other groups and individuals estranged from one another.,The idea came from Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, at a prayer breakfast he had helped organize with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. The two are co-chairmen of the Center for Jewish and Christian Values, a public policy group in Washington attached to the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works for interfaith cooperation and support for Israel.,''It really struck me how much alienation we have across this country,'' Mr. Brownback said in a telephone interview after the event, which was lightly attended by his fellow senators. The nation, he said, needs more than a reconciliation between the President and the majority of Republican senators (Mr. Brownback included) who voted to convict him.,Mr. Brownback said he had drawn inspiration from a passage in Scripture and one in the Federalist Papers, which he and other senators studied during the trial.,In Matthew 5:24, Jesus says anyone who goes to make an offering before God should ''first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.'' While reading Alexander Hamilton's Federalist, No. 65, Mr. Brownback was struck by Hamilton's argument that the Senate possessed authority to reconcile the American people to ''a decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate representatives'' in the House.,''I kept playing with the notion of reconciliation,'' Mr. Brownback said. ''We in the Senate are not only triers of fact, but also reconcilers.'',Were the public receptive, he said, a day of reconciliation might be held the Wednesday before Thanksgiving this year.,The suggestion caught the attention of at least two clergy members at the event. One, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, president of the International Fellowship, said:,''We need to find something that on the one hand brings us together, but on the other hand doesn't make us feel we're compromising our integrity. How can I in my life and how can we in our ethnic and corporate and public lives extend a hand to those of us who are different? We need to start asking that question, every church, every synagogue, every group.'',The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, was intrigued by Mr. Brownback's suggestion, although she said such ideas were ''always tricky'' in trying to translate them into an event of more than superficial nature.,Rabbi Eckstein and Ms. Campbell spoke at the gathering along with two other religious figures, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of St. Louis, Justin F. Rigali, and Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.,Ms. Campbell said she too had been reflecting on a verse from Matthew, one in the 12th chapter, in which Jesus says, ''Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.'',Ms. Campbell said: ''It's interesting to read that text. It's the message of unity.'',She said it was applicable not only to the nation but also to churches, many of which suffer their own divisions: between conservatives and liberals, or between those who interpret the Bible differently.,''We as much as anyone else need to talk about bipartisanship,'' she said. ''It's hard for us to be the ambassadors of reconciliation if we're locked into these camps.''",GUSTAV NIEBUHR,"FEB. 27, 1999",Religion Journal; Some Move to Create 'A Day of Reconciliation',https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/religion-journal-some-move-to-create-a-day-of-reconciliation.html

"The magic potion the Knicks have been using to combat the frantic National Basketball Association schedule as well as the league's young and athletic teams was diluted by weariness tonight at the Fleet Center.,The sapped Knicks, taking on the form of drooping, day-old party balloons, had nothing left after their dramatic overtime victory over Minnesota just a night earlier.,Only vaguely familiar, they practically crawled to get through the fourth quarter against a fresh Boston Celtics team. The Knicks mustered a franchise-low 9 points for a fourth quarter since the inception of the shot clock and made themselves easy victims for the Celtics, who put them away, 94-80, to end the Knicks' four-game winning streak.,The explanation for this one was simple. But Coach Jeff Van Gundy did not appear after the game to explain the obvious: this team had nothing left in reserve. Instead, Van Gundy was with team doctors because of a stomach flu that left him patrolling the sideline with chills and sweats.,Van Gundy is expected to continue on with the team to Detroit -- the Knicks play the Pistons on Sunday afternoon -- but on this night the assistant coach Don Chaney was assigned the task of discussing a game in which the Knicks were outrebounded, 46-38, and turned the ball over a season-high 22 times.,''The overtime game we had took its toll on us,'' Chaney said. ''The Celtics were the wrong team to play against after that overtime game.'',The Celtics press and cause chaos by Coach Rick Pitino's design. You need energy and snap decisions to combat that. Those qualities just were not there tonight the way they were against the Timberwolves. The crispness of Charlie Ward was replaced by a six-turnover effort. The energy of Patrick Ewing, who scored 17 points on a 7-of-15 performance, withered in the end. And there was no need for a big-time game-winner from Allan Houston (20 points) because the Knicks were down by 18 midway through a miserable fourth quarter, during which they shot 3 of 13.,''We had 9 points,'' Ewing said. ''We were just too drained to make it up.'',That's no way to keep up with Boston's prized rookie, Paul Pierce (24 points), or their budding superstar Antoine Walker (24 points) or the driving Kenny Anderson (16 points). For the second night in a row, the Knicks' league-best defense was threatened and challenged. This time, they were not up to it.,''There was no excuse for us tonight,'' Ewing said. ''They outhustled us, and outplayed us. They dominated on the boards. Being tired is no excuse. I was tired, but we have to find a way to suck it up and win.'',But how do you suck up pain? Larry Johnson was just a fragment of the player who scored 22 points a night earlier. The nagging tendinitis in his knee made him almost immobile on the court as he scored 3 points on a 1-of-5 shooting effort.,''I didn't feel too good tonight,'' Johnson said. ''It just didn't work.'',Johnson was frozen, as was the Knicks' celebrated defense. This has become a pattern for the Knicks when they hit the road. They allowed Orlando 93 points, Cleveland 98 and now the Celtics 94.,Not one person could be singled out for the Knicks' problems tonight. But although Houston hit 6 of 12 shots, his lethargy on defense was especially noticeable. Often he seemed to have gum on his shoes as the perimeter-shooting Pierce, who was 5 of 11 from 3-point range, lined up beyond the arc.,''I just shoot it when I'm open,'' Pierce said. ''I was sort of feeling it, and I said, 'What the hey, shoot it.' We just wanted to speed up the tempo. If we wore them down in the third and fourth quarter, we'd win.'',The plan worked. For most of the night, the Knicks were just trying to counter every Celtic run with one of their own until they hit the wall in a dreadful fourth quarter.,''It was ugly and pathetic,'' Chris Childs said. ''We were outplayed, outquicked, outworked. A loss. Is that enough?'',More than enough.,REBOUNDS,There were wounded Knicks all around the locker room after the game, with CHARLIE WARD the most visibly injured. He took a poke in the eye from Boston's ANTOINE WALKER two minutes into the fourth quarter. It resulted in a swollen, blood-shot right eye for Ward. He had an ice pack on it after the game, but said he expected to play in Detroit on Sunday. . . . Coach JEFF VAN GUNDY had a strong opinion concerning the sarcastic remark by Minnesota point guard STEPHON MARBURY about Ward. After Ward scored 18 points and handed out 13 assists against the Timberwolves in the Knicks' overtime victory Thursday night, Marbury said: ''If he can play like that every night, you all won't need a point guard. But what are the chances?'' In defense of Ward, Van Gundy called Marbury's comment ''a cheap shot.'' Ward said he did not care what Marbury's opinion was. . . . The Celtics were without guard RON MERCER (ankle). . . . MARCUS CAMBY may never live down his actions at UMass as far as the Boston crowd is concerned. Camby, whose entanglement with agents while he was in college led to National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions, was booed mightily by the Fleet Center crowd. Camby responded to the ill will well, though. He finished with six blocked shots.",SELENA ROBERTS,"FEB. 27, 1999",PRO BASKETBALL; Celtics Are Too Much For Exhausted Knicks,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/sports/pro-basketball-celtics-are-too-much-for-exhausted-knicks.html
"In certain contexts, silence may be golden. But that is seldom the case with Presidential silences. No one will ever know the complete truth about Juanita Broaddrick's allegation that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978. What we do know is that this is another instance in which the nation's most vital civic conversation -- the one between the chief executive and the people who elected him -- is being conducted through the President's lawyer.,The result is that the public and the press are in a muddle as to what to think of a President who seems increasingly a stranger. In his past confessions, Mr. Clinton has presented a hazy sketch of himself as a recreational philanderer. But there is now a set of allegations stretching across two decades that depict him as a serial masher or worse. There is no legal or constitutional remedy for the situation. But surely there is a limit to how long Mr. Clinton can speak through his lawyer on these matters and more broadly restrict his exchanges with the press to brief, carefully choreographed events and joint appearances with foreign visitors instead of open-ended Presidential news conferences.,Unless Mr. Clinton wants to serve out the remaining two years of his Presidency oddly isolated from the people he leads, he must find a way to resume a normal dialogue with the American people and the press. It may be that he can add little to David Kendall's terse denial about the Broaddrick allegation, but it would be nice to hear Mr. Clinton himself address the matter and provide his version of what transpired, if in fact the two did meet in a Little Rock hotel room in 1978.,But beyond the particulars of this case there is the larger need for Mr. Clinton to re-establish communication with the nation after a traumatic year. David Gergen, a former Clinton adviser, put it aptly this week in an appearance on ''Larry King Live.'' Mr. Gergen said, ''The President should have a reflective conversation with someone on television and really talk about where he is in life, what his aspirations are, talk about his past, try to help us sort this out.'',By all accounts, the White House is banking on the Broaddrick story's lacking legs, and it hopes to be able to squeak by on Mr. Kendall's unelaborated denials. But if the President remains in his customary defensive crouch, perhaps he will at least accept the advice of Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women. Mindful of the base attacks on previous accusers by Presidential agents such as James Carville and Robert Bennett, she urged Mr. Clinton to prevent such tactics being used against Ms. Broaddrick. That is a good idea on the merits. Moreover, at a time when the President has lost his voice, Ms. Ireland's statement suggests that the feminist establishment may be recovering its ability to speak to the question of Bill Clinton's conduct.",,"FEB. 27, 1999",The President's Missing Voice,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/opinion/the-president-s-missing-voice.html

"In the elongated instant that Capt. Richard J. Ashby saw the gondola cables in the path of his Marine jet, it was too late to change course enough to miss, yet the collision still seemed an eternity away, he testified today at his court-martial.,''All of a sudden there's this cable, basically,'' he said. Approaching the cables at more than 800 feet a second was, the pilot said, ''like you turned around real quick and somebody threw a baseball at your head.'' He said he thought he was about to die. He did not realize until later, he said, that 20 people had died on the ground in the accident.,They died, on Feb. 3, 1998, when the Marine Corps jet, hurtling at some 600 miles an hour on a training mission with four men aboard, sliced through two cables, sending the gondola plunging more than 300 feet to the floor of a valley near Cavalese in the Italian Alps.

Furthermore, the Defense Department's National Imagery and Mapping Agency supplied a chart that did not show the 30-year-old cableway.,The defense is expected to wrap up its case on Monday, and the judge, Lieut. Col. Robert Nunley, has said the case could go to the jury by next Wednesday. If convicted, Captain Ashby could get 10 years in prison for each of the victims.,Enduring a hard-driving cross-examination this afternoon, the captain asserted that he had followed the rules as he understood them and never intended to violate speed or altitude restrictions.,''Captain Ashby, this is not a case about intent, it's a case about negligence,'' retorted one of the prosecutors, Maj. Daniel J. Daugherty, ''Were you simply negligent, Captain Ashby, or were you recklessly negligent, doing something you weren't qualified to do, putting your aircraft into a 2,400-foot-per-minute descent and flying as low as you could and as fast as you could?'',''Neither, sir,'' replied Captain Ashby.,''Those people died because you did that,'' Major Daugherty said. But the judge ruled that the last statement was not a question, and told the eight Marine officers who make up the jury to disregard it.,Prowlers are electronic warfare planes and carry no weapons except for missiles that blow up radars on the ground. Pilots are taught to fly low to evade radar detection, and fast so that if they have to climb rapidly, they can trade speed for altitude.,Earlier, Captain Ashby described the crash itself. ''I thought, this wire is going to go through the canopy, and I thought, the flash before my eyes, we're dead, that's what I thought.'' He said he tried to push the plane's nose down and to squat down in his seat -- impossible since he was strapped it -- so the cable would not slice through the canopy and hit him in the head. It was too late to have much effect, but he said, ''It seemed like it lasted forever to me, timewise.'',''I just kind of braced for this big crash,'' he said, but ''basically nothing happened at that point.'' Describing the impact, he said, bringing a palm down on the witness-box railing, ''There's a thump like that.'',It was not until hours later, Captain Ashby said, at a military hospital where he and the three other crew members had been taken, that he knew anyone on the ground had died.,''Basically, after we finished our checkups, getting our blood pulled, as we finished, they put us in this central waiting room in the hospital,'' he said. ''When they turned the TV off that's when I got kind of, really worried. ''I mean I was already worried; that's when I became aware there was probably something more to this they don't want us to know.'',Captain Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, asked him how he reacted when the squadron commander, Col. Richard Muegge, told the crew what had happened. The captain's answer was not audible as his voice broke with emotion. (Colonel Muegge was later relieved of command because of lapses in connection with the accident.),At other times, Captain Ashby sparred vigorously with Major Daugherty. ''I'm accepting responsibility, sir,'' the captain said. But he added, ''There's a difference between responsibility and criminal responsibility, sir.'',''You can't imagine going to jail, can you?'' Major Daugherty said.,''No, I can't,'' Captain Ashby responded.,At another point, Major Daugherty said that Captain Ashby should have been ready for uncharted cables because he had trained at Whidbey Island, a naval base in Washington State, and flew in the Cascade Mountains, where loggers often set up cables that are not on charts.,And he goaded Captain Ashby about why the captain had not seen a church in the valley where he was supposed to make a turn. Major Daugherty asked why the map makers put churches on the chart, if not for navigation.,''I don't know why they mark them, sir, I'd rather have them mark the cableway than the church,'' the accused pilot replied.,Captain Ashby also described rocking his plane's wings as he entered the valley, to see the river below. That would have the effect of confusing his radar altimeter, defense witnesses said. The radar altimeter looks straight down from the plane's belly and measures the distance to the ground; it never sounded an alarm that the plane was too low, crew members have testified. But defense experts have said it could have been confused if the plane dipped one wing and the belly pointed to a distant mountain.,Major Daugherty pointed out that while the crew believed the minimum altitude allowed was 1,000 feet, investigators found a document in the cockpit showing it was 2,000. But Captain Ashby asserted that he and his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, had planned the flight from information in a folder that they were told had all the relevant information.,''We flew it professionally, we briefed it professionally, and we did it to the best of our abilities,'' Captain Ashby asserted.,Captain Schweitzer, of Westbury, N.Y., is to be tried separately on similar charges. Charges have been dropped against two other captains, who were in the rear cockpit.,Captain Ashby also described having flown the training route once before, in a flight during a previous six-month deployment to Aviano, where the Prowler squadrons provided electronic jamming over Bosnia. On the earlier occasion, he said, he had found himself cornered by mountains and clouds; moving too slowly to climb, he was saved only because the valley was large enough for him to turn the jet 180 degrees.,On the same flight, his jet came upon a parasailer. ''It scared the hell out of me and I'm sure we scared the person that we saw,'' he said. ''All of a sudden to the right and above me I could see the whites of his eyes.'',Captain Ashby said he turned the plane to an open path and looked at his navigator. ''We kind of looked at each other,'' he said, recalling an expletive he had used.,Captain Ashby said that he and other crew members had been careful to warn the rest of the squadron about the presence of parasailers in the area; there was no such warning about the cables, he said.",MATTHEW L.

"The ''perp walk'' has for much of this century been a symbiotic New York performance. The police got to show off their cunning in nabbing bad guys. The press got close-up pictures, often in time for deadlines. The public got to put a face on fear.,No one lost, unless the perpetrator turned out to be innocent. This was the sticking point that on Thursday caused a Federal judge to single out one particularly unprincipled perp walk as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.,For the sole purpose of good TV footage, Judge Allen G. Schwartz ruled, an East Side doorman accused of burglary was hauled out of a police station house in September 1995, walked slowly to a squad car and driven around the block.,Judge Schwartz said the walk was intended to humiliate the doorman, John Lauro Jr., and had ''no legitimate law enforcement objective or justification.'' The ruling means that Mr. Lauro can go ahead with a lawsuit against the city. The police, pending an appeal, have announced that they will no longer alert the news media in advance when a suspect is moved.,The perp walk, though, seems almost certain to survive Judge Schwartz. For one thing, perpetrators are always going to have to walk somewhere. And photographers are paid to wait.,Generations of photographers have made their careers in the millisecond bursts of light that punctuate their long waiting. In the 1940's, photographers were known to conspire to have someone poke a straight pin into the posterior of a perp, the better to see character in his face.,Sometimes, although not very often, reporters and photographers have served justice by peppering perps with nasty questions as they stun them with light.,''Did you do it?'' has been a perennial favorite.,That question provoked a useful answer during the perp walk of Emmanuel Torres, accused of fatally stabbing a woman during an attempted rape in 1984. He called his victim a ''slut'' and shouted, ''She deserved it!'' When he claimed innocence in court, his recorded comment was used to convict him.,John Miller, who was the spokesman for former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton and is now a reporter with ABC News, has studied the permutations of the New York perp walk over much of this century. He maintains that although it often changes, it is much too valuable for almost everyone involved to die.,''The perp walk is an evolutionary process,'' Mr. Miller said, noting that there are three basic versions of it in this century.,The first version held sway into the 1940's in the basement of the old police headquarters on Center Street, where suspects were routinely paraded across a stage in front of reporters who sized them up for newsworthiness, Mr. Miller said.,The second version, which lasted from the 1940's into the late 60's, featured reporters sitting around in station houses across the city as suspects were being booked and fingerprinted. Reporters would often have a chance to chat with suspects. Photo opportunities were usually worked out informally with the station house captain.,The most celebrated example of this kind of perp walk going wrong for the police occurred in Brooklyn in 1962 when a murder suspect, Tony (Red) Dellurnia, was whisked passed a scrum of photographers at the 62d Precinct station house.,When photographers complained angrily that they had missed their chance to photograph a man accused of killing two police officiers, Capt. Albert A. Seedman agreed to give them a second chance.,Captain Seedman, who later became a celebrated chief of detectives in the police force, described in his as-told-to autobiography, ''Chief,'' how he tried to accommodate the press:,''Gripping Dellurnia firmly by the arm, he led him from the captain's office into a grid of flashing bulbs. But Dellurnia's head was bowed and sunk so low that nobody could photograph it.,''Hold his head up so we can get at least one good shot!'' somebody shouted.,''Seedman did what he knew instantly he would regret: He gripped Dellurnia under the chin and raised his head -- as the flashbulbs went off, dozens of times.'',The photograph, which became a sensation and cost Captain Seedman a reprimand, showed the cigar-chomping officer stretching the suspect's face as if it were pizza dough. Mr. Dellurnia was acquitted of murder.,The third version of the perp walk began in the early 1970's, a function of suspects being hauled from precinct station houses to a central booking center and of the rapidly proliferating number of news media outlets in New York.,''You could let the newspaper reporters hang around in the station house, but you couldn't fit in four camera crews, each with four people,'' Mr. Miller said.,In the late 1960's, judges and police and newspaper editors formulated voluntary standards for perp walks. The guidelines emerged in 1969 from a New York Fair Trial, Free Press Conference.,''Law enforcement and court personnel should not prevent the photographing of defendants when they are in public places outside the courtroom,'' the guidelines read. ''They should neither encourage nor discourage pictures or televising, but they should not pose the accused.'' They became a formal part of New York police procedure in the early 1970's.,The contemporary standard for the perp walk is for the police to send advisories to all major news organization about opportunities to photograph suspects in cases they think are likely to attract interest.,''It got to be almost a science,'' said Mike Pearl, a reporter for more than 30 years for The New York Post. ''You get down there 10 minutes before the move and you got your picture and maybe a quote.'',For suspects, however, being ''walked'' by the police solely for the convenience of the press can turn into a maddening farce.,Russell Jones, a performer with the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, was accused in January of firing at plainclothes officers who tried to pull over his sport utility vehicle in Brooklyn. He was charged with attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon.,When Mr. Jones was moved from a holding pen to a courtroom, the police arranged for a perp walk. This meant that Mr. Jones and his lawyer, Peter Frankel, sat and waited for several hours for the media to show up, Mr. Frankel said.,''To delay the proceeding just to get some notoriety for the police is ludicrous,'' said Mr. Frankel. ''For my client it was unnecessary and prejudicial.'',A grand jury later declined to indict Mr. Jones.,Police officials have said that in light of Judge Schwartz's ruling, they will halt all future perp walks, pending the outcome of an appeal.,Mr. Miller, though, said that history suggests that when the public seems sufficiently interested in seeing the face of a desperado, the press and the police will always figure out a way to serve them -- while serving themselves.",BLAINE HARDEN,"FEB. 27, 1999","Parading of Suspects Is Evolving Tradition; Halted After a Judge's Ruling, 'Perp Walks' Are Likely to Be Revived -- in Some Form",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/nyregion/parading-suspects-evolving-tradition-halted-after-judge-s-ruling-perp-walks-are.html
"An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration today recommended approval of the world's first continuous glucose sensor for diabetics, made by Minimed Inc.,Diabetics now measure their blood sugar levels by pricking a finger and drawing a drop of blood, a painful process that most perform no more than a few times a day.,Minimed asserts, and many diabetes experts agree, that a continuous measurement would provide more detailed information, allowing diabetics to better control their sugar levels. Better control has been shown to reduce long-term complications of diabetes.,''This is real breakthrough technology from our perspective,'' Dr. Steven Gutman, director of the division of clinical laboratory devices at the F.D.A., said in an interview after the panel decision. ''It will help physicians better manage patients.'',The advisory panel, which met in Gaithersburg, Md., asked for more data on how the sensor worked in ethnic minorities and those with Type 2 diabetes, usually not as serious as Type 1. The F.D.A., which must approve the device before it can be sold, usually follows the advice of its expert panels.,Minimed's stock rose from about $60 in November to $118.75 recently, partly on anticipation of the glucose sensor's approval. But the stock has fallen sharply in the last two weeks as doubts arose about the sensor's approval and market prospects. The stock fell $3.00, to $85.25, today. The panel's decision came after the close of trading. Minimed's system consists of a tiny probe that is inserted in the skin of the abdomen and a pager-sized device that records the data. Besides being the first continuous sensor, it is the first to measure glucose in the fluid under the skin, rather than in the blood itself. The probe must be replaced after three days.,Analysts expect sales of Minimed's sensor will be modest at first since only the most serious diabetics will want something under their skin and to wear the pager-like device. In addition, the device will not replace the finger prick, only supplement it. That is because it will not display its readings to diabetics themselves, only to physicians. But the company hopes that future products will show the data to patients, replacing the finger pricks. A key question is the accuracy of measurements of glucose in the fluid under the skin. Minimed presented data showing a close correlation between its measurements and those of glucose in the blood. F.D.A. officials said the results were accurate but not as accurate as the company contended.",ANDREW POLLACK,"FEB. 27, 1999",Panel of F.D.A.

"Here is some of this week's Washington news that was not covered on tonight's edition of the PBS public affairs show ''Washington Week in Review'':,Ken Bode, moderator of the show, which many local journalists consider a last outpost of high-level, low-decibel talk about the events of the day, seems to have been edged out in a search for more edge and attitude.,Mr. Bode's producer, Elizabeth Piersol, was dismissed outright, apparently for backing Mr. Bode's version of events. He said the show's new executive vice president, Dalton Delan, had proposed such innovations as injecting more opinion into the show, along with more conservative versus liberal back-and-forth, some man-in-the-street interviews, occasional appearances by high school and college journalists and other ''surprise'' guests.,A board member, Roger Wilkins, resigned in protest. And the station was deluged with calls from several hundred viewers who said they liked the old formula: substantive discussions by beat reporters who know what they are talking about. Disgusted longtime panelists called one another, bemoaning what one referred to as ''some kind of a watershed moment if public television can't sustain a serious program like this.'',As the show blew up off camera, Mr. Delan, who did not return phone calls today, told The Washington Post that ''the show is not about attitude and opinion'' and would not be overhauled, only tweaked. By week's end, the station appeared to be backtracking, saying no one had ever intended to take ''Washington Week in Review'' in a new direction.,The whole episode speaks to an ongoing discussion in journalism: just how much attitude and opinion should a reporter disclose? In this case, the question seemed to have been settled quite suddenly today when, to quiet the controversy, the station said it would temporarily bring back Paul Duke, who was the moderator for 20 years until the livelier Mr. Bode replaced him in 1994.,Tonight, the guest host Steve Roberts thanked Mr. Bode for his ''unique style'' during his years of service. Then Mr. Roberts announced that Mr. Duke would be back for a few months, hoping to reassure viewers that ''Washington Week'' will remain the kind of pre-Monica, pre-O.J. show where reporters kept their opinions to themselves.,Sharon Percy Rockefeller, WETA- TV's president, also announced, to Washington viewers only, that nothing important was going to change. On Thursday, Mrs. Rockefeller confirmed that the show was having trouble lining up guests this week; ''we've had some of that but we often have a conflict in schedules,'' she said. Three other people who had recently spoken to Mr. Delan about his plans confirmed Mr. Bode's account of the direction in which he apparently intended to take the show. One of the three, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Delan, who joined the show late last year, had said he wanted to make ''Washington Week'' more like ''The View,'' the Barbara Walters chat show whose sillier moments are regularly lampooned on ''Saturday Night Live.'',But Mrs. Rockefeller said, ''There was a real misunderstanding as to what were ideas, discussed in a free-form manner, versus what were plans.'' She declined to discuss Ms. Piersol's departure, and said Mr. Bode was not forced out: ''His contract just wasn't renewed in the way he wanted it to be.'',Mr. Bode, a veteran newsman who is also dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, said that Mr. Delan ''wanted edge, attitude and opinion and I said that's contrary to everything we do.'' Shortly afterward, Mr. Bode said, Mr. Delan promised to get back to him with a new contract -- it was to expire in March. But the next thing Mr. Bode heard was that his job had been offered to Gwen Ifill, an NBC News correspondent and frequent guest on the show. Later, Mr. Bode was offered a short-term contract, but learned late this week that he would not be back on the air.,Mrs. Rockefeller denied that Mr. Bode's job was offered to Ms. Ifill, who said she turned it down primarily because it would have taken too much time away from her day job.,After the events of the week, Ms. Ifill concluded: ''They're taking a really good show and blowing it up. I know half a dozen people who will never do the show again.'',Some regulars, however, said they believed that disaster had already been averted. ''I'm quite optimistic that it will continue to be what it has been, and not high-torque opinion and food fights,'' said Alan Murray, Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal.,Tonight the show's regulars will be taking Mr. Bode out on the town for an alternative discussion of the week's events.",MELINDA HENNEBERGER,"FEB. 27, 1999","On a Public Affairs TV Show, It Was the Week That Wasn't",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/on-a-public-affairs-tv-show-it-was-the-week-that-wasn-t.html
"An inmate convicted in one of the most notorious cases of murder of a New York City police officer a decade ago has been awarded $660,000 in damages for being locked up for more than four years in solitary confinement.,A Federal jury in Rochester found that the inmate, David McClary, had suffered mental distress during the time that prison officials kept him locked in a tiny cell and that his civil rights had been violated.,Mr. McClary is serving 25 years to life for the 1988 slaying of a rookie police officer, Edward Byrne, who was shot to death as he sat alone in a patrol car outside the Queens home of a drug-case witness he was guarding.,The death, during the height of the crack epidemic, led to major police drives against drug dealers and eventually to the arrest and 1989 convictions of Mr. McClary and three other members of a crack-trafficking group.,Prison officials said that the notoriety of Mr. McClary's crime made it necessary to segregate him from other inmates.,But Tom Terrizzi, the associate director of Prisoners Legal Services of New York, which helped Mr. McClary file his case, said that the isolation, especially for a lengthy period, was egregious.,''Obviously the jury recognized the serious damage that can take place after four years in solitary confinement,'' he said. ''We think the award is appropriate for the suffering he endured.'',Mr. Terrizzi pointed to research that showed isolated confinement for substantial periods of time can have a severe and permanent psychological impact.,The jury decided that prison officials were within their rights for initially putting Mr. McClary in a 23-hour-a-day lockup, but violated his rights by his continued confinement there.,There is no statute in New York state on how long prisoners can be held in solitary confinement.,Prosecutors said they planned to appeal the decision.,On Tuesday, after two weeks of testimony in the case, the jury found the former Commissioner of Prisons, Thomas A.

"What looked like ''Mission Impossible'' two weeks ago became mission accomplished yesterday, as the financial analysts who organized Wall Street's annual fund-raising drive for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund broke the record for the most money the drive has raised.,Young analysts from Salomon Smith Barney delivered $77,593 to The New York Times Company Foundation yesterday on behalf of workers at seven prominent financial institutions, including Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. This money brought their total contribution in this campaign to $201,286. This sum breaks last year's record of $191,391, and represents the institutions' largest contribution since the effort began in 1991. The money has been deposited and will be reflected in the fund's totals in the days to come.,This outcome appeared extremely unlikely in early February, when the analysts had raised just $104,060. They were frustrated, having been ignored and rebuffed by executives at several major brokerages. Four of the 11 institutions that had pledged to support the fund had dropped out. The young analysts had been forced to cancel a fund-raising breakfast because too few executives were willing to meet with them.,The centerpiece of their effort, the ''Into the Streets'' initiative, which included a tour of two charitable sites on Washington Heights, had attracted just a dozen people, all of whom worked for Salomon Smith Barney.,Patrick Abouchalache, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, described the situation in bleak terms.,''It was a case of analyst apathy,'' he said.,Yesterday, the analysts were exultant. They said that in recent weeks, many top executives had contributed to the fund. Several C.E.O.'s had offered to meet them for lunch to discuss their efforts. And the analysts had raised nearly as much money in two weeks as they had in the preceding three months.,The analysts said that an article in the Neediest Cases series that described their difficulties had helped draw attention to their work.,''After that, we got more support down the stretch from some top people, and that helped us set the record,'' said Evan Karp, the 22-year-old treasurer of the Wall Street effort.,Sunshine Smyth, another leader of the Wall Street campaign, said she was surprised that the bankers were able to rally and break the record.,''I was hoping we could match last year's, but I definitely didn't think we'd break it,'' said Ms. Smyth, 24.,Ms. Smyth said just 7 financial institutions had contributed, as opposed to 11 last year. In addition to Salomon Smith Barney, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, the banks were Bear Stearns, Credit Suisse First Boston, Paine Webber and Warburg Dillon Read.,The analysts said they were hoping to raise even more before the Neediest Cases campaign ends tomorrow. Donations to this year's campaign will be accepted if they are postmarked before March 3. After that, any contributions will be added to next year's total.,And the analysts are already making plans for next year. Mr. Abouchalache, 24, said he had spoken with nonprofit groups from across the country to learn more about fund-raising. He said that the bankers plan to hold a comedy show this spring to benefit the fund.,Mr. Karp said he hoped that next year, more analysts would donate not only their money, but also their time, to join the next ''Into the Streets'' tour.,''That way, people won't just hand over their money and think it's going to an administrative bureaucracy,'' he said.

"The veteran cellist Janos Starker is given to making big statements these days, but in the unshowiest of manners. Last season he played a program at the 92d Street Y consisting entirely of three Bach cello suites, in which he seemed to be communing with the composer rather than performing in public. Now he has returned for two recitals presenting all the Beethoven cello sonatas and variations, with Shigeo Neriki as pianist.,In this case, the unshowiness is largely built into the music. It was Beethoven, in his cello sonatas as in his violin sonatas, who completed the transformation of such works into true duos, with the string instrument liberated from the shadow of the keyboard. But pianist himself, he did not do so all at once or entirely consistently.,In much of the first program on Thursday evening, in early variations as well as sonatas, the cello had not yet grown into its role as full partner, with Mr. Starker often left to mere ornament or harmonic filler, however much he might have ennobled it with his understated eloquence. It was amusing, in fact, to hear him drop out altogether in the first variation of each of two sets: 12 Variations on ''Ein Madchen Oder ein Weibchen,'' from Mozart's ''Zauberflote,'' which was presented as an encore and will be repeated tonight in his second recital, and 12 Variations on ''See, the Conquering Hero Comes,'' from Handel's ''Judas Maccabaeus.'',What all of that means, of course, is that the pianist, playing steadily throughout and carrying the brunt of the developmental activity, is at least as crucial to the success of a performance as the cellist.,Mr. Nerigi, who has collaborated with Mr. Starker for more than two decades and is a fellow professor at Indiana University, did his part admirably, playing with fine fluidity and an excellent sense of structure, a worthy match at every turn for Mr. Starker's splendid contribution.,Even in the early sonatas, the F Major and G minor (Op. 5, Nos. 1 and 2), these artists found meaning in every phrase. And the later C Major  (Op. 102, No. 1) took on added grandeur partly for being couched between them.,Imagine what the players will do tonight, when the balance shifts toward later works.

"Flamenco became an art of both pushing outward and pulling inward when the Maria Benitez Teatro Flamenco came to the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night. Both aspects of this Spanish dance form were vividly on display in two solos, choreographed by their performers, which were part of ''Formas e Imagenes,'' the suite of pieces that concluded the program.,Antonio Granjero looked contained and controlled at the start of his ''Solea.'' But as he continued moving, his dancing exemplified flamenco at its most extroverted. Mr. Granjero seemed to be someone struggling to break loose. His steps grew ever bigger and wilder as he battled and conquered the air and the ground with his strong arms and legs.,In her ''Granaina,'' Ms. Benitez, a choreographer from New Mexico, danced as if she were all alone. An audience may have been watching her. But she was someone off in a world of her own. Her moods often changed as if passing thoughts. And the solo became a portrait of an introspective woman preserving her privacy in a public space.,The troupe of dancers, singers and musicians also offered four New York premieres, the most unusual of which was Ms. Benitez's ''Folies d'Espagne,'' to music by the 17th-century composer Marin Marais, with Rosamund Morley as viola da gamba soloist, accompanied by two guitarists: Jose (Chuscales) Valle Fajardo, who is also the company's music director, and Roberto Castellon. Dancers kept entering, entranced by Marais's haunting melody, which at one point inspired a bit of castanet playing. The choreography could have suggested the music's mounting spell ever more strongly as the dance continued. Yet the work managed to blend passion with dignity.,Mr. Granjero's ''Estampa Flamenco'' opened the evening with vigor and in his ''Aires de Cadiz,'' which closed the first act, an ensemble of dancers appeared to be letting their steps declare, ''Here we are and we're happy to be here!'' ''Alegrias,'' a solo choreographed and danced by Imaculada Ortega, began rather blandly, but caught fire as it proceeded.,Unfortunately, the program was overamplified, making some of the music sound clattery and turning a single handclap into a crack of thunder. But amplification can probably be fixed during the course of the troupe's engagement through March 7 at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea.",JACK ANDERSON,"FEB. 27, 1999",MUSIC REVIEW; When Flamenco Casts Its Fiery Spell,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/music-review-when-flamenco-casts-its-fiery-spell.html
"If tangos can find their way into the classical repertory, as they have through the works of Astor Piazzolla and the enthusiasm of Gidon Kremer, Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax, perhaps flamenco can be adopted as well. Its stylistic cousin, zarzuela, has a champion in Placido Domingo, and when the Brooklyn Philharmonic offered a weekend devoted to flamenco and its influence on Spanish classical composition two years ago, it played to sold-out houses.,The Perspectives Ensemble, an enterprising group directed by Sato Moughalian, its flutist, cast its vote in flamenco's favor on Tuesday evening at St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University. The program, which lived up to the ensemble's name, began with an invigorating flamenco set by Esperanza Fernandez, a cantaora, or flamenco singer, and her brother Paco Fernandez, a guitarist, as a prelude to Manuel de Falla's synthesis of the flamenco spirit and orchestral coloration in ''El Amor Brujo.'',The evidence suggests that flamenco is considerably less likely than tangos to cross into the classical repertory, if only because its demands are so specialized and so contrary to those of classical performance. With tangos, it is often argued that classical players don't have the rhythmic flexibility to play the music persuasively. That flexibility can be cultivated. But in pure flamenco -- unfiltered by the sensibilities of Falla, Turina and Albeniz -- everything from vocal timbre to the ability to improvise within the confines of a highly stylized expressive language falls outside the experience of most classical musicians.,The Fernandezes offered songs in various flamenco forms and gave a superb demonstration of how flamenco reverses classical notions of coarseness and subtlety. Ms. Fernandez's mezzo-soprano has a gritty sound that is indispensable for this passionate, earthy music, and she used it resourcefully, not only varying its coloration and dynamics with a consummate sense of drama, but drawing on the resonance of the chapel to create expressive effects that would have been impossible in a smaller room.,Accompanying flamenco is a peculiar balancing act: a chord progression supports the vocal line, but whether the chords are strummed, rolled, ornately embellished or punctuated with percussive tapping is a function of the text, and the guitarist's improvisations must fill out the texture and comment on the vocal line without overpowering it. Mr. Fernandez's guitar playing was consistently beguiling in its fleetness and its responsiveness to the vocal line.,The version of ''El Amor Brujo'' that the group presented was no less stunning. Instead of the 1925 ballet version, the Perspectives players used the 1915 original, which has a more extensive vocal part and a close connection to the music's flamenco roots. Ms. Fernandez, who sang and narrated the score, conveyed a vivid sense of the folkloric culture of witches, sorcerers and lost lovers that populates the text.,One would think that this work, with its rhythmic suppleness and bright hues, needed the coordinating hand of a conductor. The 15-player Perspectives Ensemble worked without one, yet gave a performance that was remarkably polished, fastidiously balanced and full of electricity.",ALLAN KOZINN,"FEB. 27, 1999",MUSIC REVIEW; Reversing Classical Notions of Subtlety,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/music-review-reversing-classical-notions-of-subtlety.html
"At least in New York, the composer Wayne Peterson has mostly been more heard about than heard. Now 71, Mr. Peterson is a noted musical figure in the Bay Area of California and has been a professor at San Francisco State University for over 30 years.,Unfortunately, he received the most attention of his career when he was awarded the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Music amid controversy. The jury of three experts who had judged the musical entries recommended a work by the much-respected composer Ralph Shapey for the award. It was one of the rare instances when the full Pulitzer panel bypassed the jury's recommendation and gave the prize to another of the three finalists, Mr. Peterson, setting off an outcry from the composers on the jury and attendant press coverage.,But the music is what matters, so it was a valuable gesture for the estimable New York New Music Ensemble to present a ''Celebration of Wayne Peterson'' on Wednesday night at Merkin Concert Hall.,The program began with two duos by Mr. Peterson. The first, from 1972, a Capriccio for flute and piano, is an effective, highly coloristic and compact concert work. Mr. Peterson's musical language is steeped in the 12-tone esthetic without even being strict about the technique. His linear writing is often darting and angular. But Bartok's harmony and Stravinsky's rhythmic energy are also influences. The flute tends to dominate this duo, which gets fairly combative.,The flutist Jayn Rosenfeld and the pianist Edmund Niemann played it compellingly. ''Duodecaphony'' for viola and cello (1998) is a similarly well crafted, cogent and solid piece, with spiraling rhythmic drive and busy thematic interplay. The violist Lois Martin and the cellist Christopher Finckel gave a bracing performance.,That said, for all the skill and integrity in these works, one did not get a strong sense of musical profile from them. It may not have been  helpful to follow these works with the New York premiere of ''Catch,'' a theater piece by Thomas Ades, the new young composer sensation of England. Say what you will about the hype around Mr. Ades, his music is arrestingly original. The theatrical element is written into the piece: a pianist, a cellist and a violinist, seated on stage, fend off the attempts of a wandering clarinetist to join them. The clarinetist outcast tries plaintive entreaties, aggressive assaults, and a sort of ''nyah, nyah'' children's taunt. All the efforts are repelled, until the work's wistful yet quizzical ending.,Mr. Ades has a vacuum ear, and you hear bits of this and that in the piece. Yet he has an engaging voice and audacious imagination. Mr. Niemann, Mr. Finckel, the violinist Linda Quan, and the clarinetist Jean Kopperud played it impressively.,As a theatrical experience, Diana McIntosh's ''Time and Again,'' which received its premiere, was more tame. Three musicians enact the contentious rehearsal of a new work, complete with hurled barbs. Eventually, they settle down and play the piece through. But the jokes could have come from a sitcom, and the music, though feisty and organic, did not make a strong enough independent impression.,The concert ended with Mr. Peterson's ''Diptych'' (1993) for large ensemble, a 20-minute, intricately contrapuntal piece. The second of its two movements, with its pulsating rhythms, drew from Mr. Peterson's younger days as a jazz player. It's an accomplished work, performed engagingly under the conductor Jeffrey Milarsky. The composer could not ask for better advocates.",ANTHONY TOMMASINI,"FEB. 27, 1999",MUSIC REVIEW; Darting Polyphony to Daring Drama,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/music-review-darting-polyphony-to-daring-drama.html
"After more than five months of testimony, the Microsoft Corporation rested its case today in the Government's landmark antitrust suit, but not before the presiding judge had shouted angrily at the company's final witness and ordered him to stop talking.,Today's incident was yet another blow in several months of missteps and embarrassments as Microsoft has tried to defend itself against Government charges that the company bullied the computer industry and used its monopoly in computer operating systems to the disadvantage of competitors.,The trial is not over; court will reconvene in mid-April for several weeks of testimony from rebuttal witnesses, three to a side. But as Microsoft completed its central case today, six weeks after the Government completed its case, both sides said they were confident of victory.,John Warden, Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, acknowledged that others believed that the Government had ''succeeded in undermining our witnesses.'' But he called this a desperation tactic. ''When you don't have the laws or the facts, you try credibility, and that's what I think has driven them to this strategy.'',David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, who has tripped up and embarrassed most of Microsoft's witnesses, said he believed that casting doubt on witnesses' credibility was not all that had been achieved.,''They've admitted monopoly power,'' he said. ''They've admitted the absence of competitive constraints. They've admitted raising prices to hurt consumers. They've admitted depriving consumers of choice.'',In the witness box today, Robert Muglia, a Microsoft senior vice president, tried to put the best face on his company's relationship with Sun Microsystems, the creator and owner of the Java programming language. The Government charges that Microsoft tried to sabotage Sun because it saw Java as a competitive threat.,Mr. Muglia, who said Microsoft's relationship with Sun was his responsibility, repeatedly asserted that Microsoft was  interested in cooperating with Sun. But Mr. Boies presented numerous E-mail  messages and memos from senior Microsoft executives, saying in one manner or another that they wanted to defeat Sun.,The combined effect of the memos was to leave the impression that if Mr. Muglia was to be believed, he was either out of touch or naive. And his continued defense of his position, even in the face of a contradictory E-mail from William H. Gates, the company's chairman, set off the judge.,In May 1997, Mr. Gates wrote: ''I am hard-core about NOT supporting'' the latest version of Java. Messages in the same string of E-mail from other senior executives made the same statement, but with exclamation points and expletives.,Yet Mr. Muglia tried to make the case that Mr. Gates had not really meant what he wrote, adding, ''I don't exactly know what Bill meant by support.'',At that, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case without a jury, shook his head and interrupted with an irritated tone, saying: ''There's no question he says he does not like the idea of supporting it. Let's not argue about it.'',Mr. Muglia persisted, pleading with the judge, ''Can I say one more thing, please?'',But a few seconds after he began what promised to be a long discourse defending his position, Judge Jackson exploded. One hand covering his face, the other held up at the witness, he bellowed: ''No! Stop! There is no question pending!'',He then called a recess.,Microsoft spokesmen said they believed that Mr. Muglia needed to keep his answers shorter.,Earlier, Mr. Boies had showed him a Microsoft memo setting out the company's strategy on Java. The first line was: ''Kill cross-platform Java by growing the polluted Java market.'' Sun and the Government  accuse Microsoft of creating its own ''polluted'' version of Java to undermine Sun's version. Microsoft argues that its version is better.,Mr. Muglia said the document was written by a junior employee and was later revised by her supervisor.,Judge Jackson's outburst followed questions he had asked earlier in the day suggesting that he was skeptical of Microsoft's case.,While lawyers warn that it is dangerous to read too much into a judge's remarks, it is also true that judges often pose questions at the end of a trial that are intended to test conclusions they are considering for use in their final ruling.,This morning Microsoft's lawyer was questioning the preceding witness, Joachim Kempin, a Microsoft vice president, prompting him to list the modifications Microsoft was now allowing computer manufacturers to make to its Windows operating system. A year ago, the company forbade most or all such changes, which contributed to Federal antitrust charges.,Judge Jackson interrupted the questions to ask in an even tone: ''Are all these rights manufacturers now possess a matter of sufferance and grace on the part of Microsoft, or are they expressly written into the contracts?'',Mr. Kempin said some were granted in personal letters to the companies, others in phone conversations -- not in contracts.,''So you have chosen to waive or give up certain rights you have in your contract?'' the judge said.,That's right, Mr. Kempin said. The judge's questions appeared to mirror the Government's assertions that Microsoft's new generosity to manufacturers could be temporary -- lasting only as long as Microsoft's previous behavior is the subject of antitrust charges.,As Mr. Kempin completed his testimony, he turned to the next topic of testimony: Java. He offered an eloquent argument for the tenuous nature of Microsoft's dominant position in the industry. Among other threats, he said, Java was such a powerful idea that it could cause ''a paradigm shift'' that would unseat Microsoft.,But that exposed a contradiction in Microsoft's defense. Mr. Muglia, in his written, direct testimony, said Sun's version of Java was so dreadful that Microsoft had every right to create its own version.,Sun's Java, he wrote, ''is truly the great equalizing software; it has reduced all computers to mediocrity and buggyness.'',At the end of the day, Mr. Muglia described a conversation in which  Mr. Gates had told him that Microsoft, which had licensed Java from Sun, could meet its contractual obligations by simply posting Sun's version of Java on Microsoft's Web site, rather than including it in Windows.,Then Mr. Boies introduced a memo in which the company executives charged with doing that described what they had done.,The Java file was posted, one executive wrote, ''but there will be no entry index'' for it, and as a result a consumer would ''have to stumble across it.'',''I put it in a directory with 37 other old files,'' the executive wrote. ''In this directory I'd say it's pretty buried.'',''Awesome,'' the other executive wrote back. ''Thanks.'',Mr. Muglia insisted that he had ''said specifically that I didn't want it to be hidden.'' And he suggested that the hidden copy was just a draft.,But Mr. Boies said simply, ''I have no more questions.'' The trial adjourned.",JOEL BRINKLEY,"FEB. 27, 1999","Microsoft Rests Its Case, Ending On a Misstep",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/business/microsoft-rests-its-case-ending-on-a-misstep.html

"Bond prices rallied yesterday, ending a three-day slide that sent interest rates to their highest levels since August. But even with the rebound, interest rates still remain high and are still a threat to the outlook for the stock market.,The stock market reflected this view, as the major indexes all declined, ending a volatile week on a down note. Another round of worries about technology stocks also pulled equities lower.,Compaq Computer plunged almost 14 percent after some analysts downgraded their expectations for first-quarter sales and profits. The revisions at Credit Suisse First Boston came after a meeting with Compaq executives, who said that January sales had been soft.,The sales weakness raised concern about the entire computer industry at a time when investors are wondering if the sharp run-up in technology stocks since October is still justifiable given the earning prospects for the year.,I.B.M., down 2.2 percent, and Hewlett-Packard, off 6.7 percent, led the Dow Jones industrial average lower. Intel, down 6.1 percent, and Microsoft, off 2.2 percent, weighed on the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks.,But what has really been spooking investors almost all week is the hangover from the testimony about the economy and monetary policy given Tuesday and Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.,Although Mr. Greenspan presented a balanced outlook, investors seemed bent on focusing on the negatives. Bond yields had already been rising all month because investors were worried that the strong growth at the end of last year and the absence of signs of a slowdown in the first months of 1999 would force the Fed to raise interest rates to slow the economy. With this bias, investors seemed to seize on one comment from the chairman that hinted at a rate increase later in the year.,And there could be more volatile weeks ahead as the Federal Reserve and Wall Street analysts await new data on the economy. Even if the economy begins to slow, as many economists still expect, there are likely to be no signs of this any earlier than April, when the data for March are reported.,''It is going to take some time before the market is convinced,'' said Mitchell J. Held, co-manager of United States economics at Salomon Smith Barney. And because data for February still look strong, that means interest rates could move higher in the near term, he said.,Bond traders said that yesterday's rally was a product of three factors: the three-day selloff had gone too far, too fast; the highest yields in more than six months were attracting some investors, and the report that inflation in the fourth quarter dipped to an annual rate of seven-tenths of a percent, the lowest rate in more than 40 years.,This positive note on inflation was reassuring because it showed once again that the economy was still managing to outfox traditional economic theories and grow swiftly without rising prices. For this reason, the Commerce Department's report that the economy grew at a blistering 6.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter had much less negative impact than it might have had.,In late bond trading, the price of the 30-year bond rose 1 4/32 , to 95 11/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.57 percent, from 5.65 percent Thursday. The yield had fallen as low as 5.54 percent earlier in the day.,Trading in the stock market was as volatile as in the bond market. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 32 points in early trading and down as much as 113 points.

"In a surprising turn after years of complex negotiations, the Pacific Lumber Company has rejected a $480 million deal to create a public preserve from ancient redwood forests.,The deal, brokered by Federal and state officials, to spare the 8,000-acre tract known Headwaters Forest and two smaller ancient groves 250 miles north of here began to unravel last week, when Pacific Lumber balked at provisions that would protect delicate streams and wildlife habitats throughout the company's property.,Pacific Lumber began trying to ease proposed 50-year restrictions on its logging rights, contending that they would financially cripple the company. But on Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis made a final offer that did not ease the environmental rules, which were intended to protect endangered fish and bird habitats.,This afternoon, John Campbell, president of Pacific Lumber, a 130-year-old logging company based in Scotia, in North California, said the company had rejected the deal because the restrictions would have cut its harvest level significantly below what it needs to remain profitable and would force hundreds of layoffs.,''Essentially, the package that's on the table today, we felt, went beyond striking a balance between sound economic development and protecting the environment,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''We indicated that there were elements of the plan that we could not live with and they rejected them.'',By rejecting the deal today, Pacific Lumber has left little time or room for further negotiations, since the appropriation of $250 million that Congress set aside for its share of the deal expires on Monday. In any event, Mr. Campbell said this afternoon that Pacific Lumber's decision was final.,The company's move clearly stunned state and Federal officials, who had been saying as late as today that they believed the company would agree to the deal by tonight.,In a terse written statement, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said: ''I believe that this transaction would have best interests of both Pacific Lumber and the American public. It would have provided economic security for Pacific Lumber by providing them a road map for future harvests. The transaction would have also provided protection for endangered species in the area and would have assured permanent protection for the Headwaters forest.'',Governor Davis criticized Pacific Lumber, the bane of environmentalists who have spent a decade protesting the company's aggressive logging practices, as reneging on a deal that could have quelled the many lawsuits and demonstrations that have been made against it.,''Despite an offer of nearly half a billion dollars,'' he said, ''the company was unwilling to accept reasonable limits proposed by the Federal and state governments on its ability to log ancient redwoods. Its unfortunate that the company turned its back on an agreement that would have brought an end to 10 years of litigation, protest, heartache and economic uncertainty.'',In fact, many environmental groups were against the Headwaters agreement, asserting that the deal did not go far enough to protect ancient forests and fragile habitats and did not include enough woodlands.,Kevin Bundy, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Information Center, which has spent years challenging Pacific Lumber's practices in Federal court, said he considered the end of the deal ''a pretty good thing.'',''It gets us out of a loophole-ridden plan,'' Mr. Bundy said. ''On the other hand, the state and Federal officials now have a clear duty to insure that Pacific Lumber doesn't kill our salmon and foul our water through their logging operations.'',He also expressed skepticism that the deal was finally over.,''Every time Pacific Lumber has reached a point where it said, 'We can't do this, it's a deal breaker,' the state and Federal governments have caved in,'' Mr. Bundy said.,Under the Endangered Species and Clean Water Acts, Pacific Lumber could harvest Headwaters and other ancient groves even if the government paid nothing for it. But Charles Hurwitz, president of  Maxxam, which controls Pacific Lumber, filed a lawsuit against the government saying he was required to be compensated for private land that he could not use because of the Endangered Species Act.,The proposal Pacific Lumber rejected required Mr. Hurwitz, who acquired Pacific Lumber in a hostile takeover in 1985, to drop his lawsuit. By not dropping it, environmentalists said, the company could continue logging, claiming it had a right to do so while it challenged the law.,Today, Mr. Campbell said that while the company had no intention of logging in old groves, ''especially the ones that are delineated in the agreement,'' the company ''intends to look at all our options.''",EVELYN NIEVES,"FEB. 27, 1999",Lumber Company Rejects Deal to Preserve Redwoods,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/lumber-company-rejects-deal-to-preserve-redwoods.html
"To the Editor:,You say (news article, Feb. 20) that a discussion at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council meeting about whether or not people trying to organize workers should wear tongue rings was ''nearly comical.'' This shows a misunderstanding of working people.,An important component in successful organizing is to bridge artificial gaps in communication between workers and unions. When unions use countercultural organizers, an artificial gap is created.,Workers are not as tolerant as some elitist intellectuals about countercultural values and conduct. They tend to have traditional values. Those who seek to organize them must respect those values.,The unions are to be complimented for identifying a serious problem of cultural disconnect that may exist between some union organizers and the people they seek to organize.  Overcoming this is an important first step in educating working people about the benefits of unionism. If this means that some organizers must sacrifice the rings in their tongues, so be it.,BRUCE A.

"Labor leaders are known more for wanting to protect the status quo than for taking risks. But Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, is a notorious risk-taker, and that is why his union this week won labor's biggest organizing drive in 60 years.,Mr. Stern's penchant for risk also explains why his union is the nation's fastest-growing and why, labor experts say, he may someday succeed John J. Sweeney as president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.,Making a major bet, the service employees spent 11 years and more than $1 million on a drive that paid off on Thursday, when vote-counters announced that 74,000 Los Angeles home-care workers for the elderly and disabled had chosen to be represented by the union.,In Los Angeles a decade ago, Mr. Stern, then the union's organizing director, took another major risk, engaging in civil disobedience that at first backfired. Hoping to gain recognition for 2,000 janitors working in the city's office towers, the union staged sit-ins and other protests, including a march on a Century City office complex where the police beat several dozen demonstrators.,That violence in response to the service employees' Justice for Janitors campaign so appalled political and business leaders that they pressured janitorial companies into settling with the union.,In a movement where many leaders long refused to stick their necks out to reverse labor's decline, Mr. Stern has broken the mold. And his  success is inspiring workers and slowly getting other labor leaders to copy his ways, even as some criticize his confrontational tactics and what they call his top-down style of management.,''The culture of the labor movement is it's safer to lose the old way than to have the courage to try to win in a new way,'' said Mr. Stern, a 48-year-old graduate of the University of Pennsylvania.,Mr. Stern is a native of West Orange, N.J., who started climbing the union's ladder after becoming a social worker in Philadelphia in 1972.  When he was elected president of the service employees three years ago --  succeeding Mr. Sweeney, who had left to take the helm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- he vowed to do his utmost to stop labor's long slide in influence and its share of the work force.,He has changed his own union's direction by devoting 47 percent of its $80 million budget to organizing new members -- a huge percentage compared with that of other unions, which on average spend less than 5 percent on organizing.,Mr. Stern, long considered a Sweeney protege, has also been a leading practitioner of an important strategy: to seek to organize all the workers in a particular market -- all of Washington's janitors, for instance.  This gives the union bargaining clout  and makes it all but impossible for nonunion contractors to undercut unionized ones.,''Andy Stern is one of the smartest labor leaders in the country,'' said Richard Hurd, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. ''He has consistently looked into the future with a strategic focus, and that sets him apart from virtually all other major labor leaders. A lot of labor leaders try to hold on to the past and are afraid of taking big risks to change things. But Andy has been willing to take big risks.'',Mr. Stern's aggressive style and tactics have earned him plenty of critics. Some other labor leaders, while envious of his organizing victories, complain privately that he is  arrogant in his repeated boasts that his union is ''leading the way'' (the service employees' motto). And the confrontational tactics he sometimes favors, as when he blocked bridges in Washington in organizing janitors there, have enraged politicians and the public.,Mr. Stern says he has to walk both sides of the street, sometimes embracing cooperation, other times confrontation. Sit-ins, he maintains,  are an appropriate weapon for bringing attention to the plight of workers when other tactics fail.,Rit Thompson, president of P & R Enterprises, which employs 2,000 janitors in the Washington area, says the bridge-blocking cost the union  some credibility. But he nonetheless praises Mr. Stern as pragmatic, explaining that Washington employers  agreed to recognize the union and grant raises to the janitors after the union chief listened at length to management's point of view and accepted some of its proposals.,''Andy Stern,'' said Tom Balanoff, a longtime service employees official, ''understands that about 90 percent of interactions with management is developing relations. The other 10 percent is you need to be able to squeeze them when the time comes.'',Some union members complain that Mr. Stern runs a top-down union,  that he pushes everyone to back his positions and does not consult sufficiently before making decisions.,''He's a progressive leader, and that's good, but he doesn't get much input from the rank and file,'' said Paul Pamias, a doorman in Manhattan. When Mr. Stern spends so much on organizing, ''I don't see a lot of the rank and file saying, 'Let's do this.' It's pretty much top-down.'',Responding to criticism of his tactics, Mr. Stern insists that he runs one of the most democratic of unions and that when he explains to members the importance of organizing more workers, they immediately support spending more on it.,''We're not trying to increase our membership just for the sake of getting new members,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The whole purpose is it will help us improve the lives of our members.'',Mr. Stern's union has 600,000 health care workers, having expanded its lead as the nation's largest health care union two years ago when New York City's biggest union, 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees, merged into the service employees.,To follow up on this week's organizing victory in Los Angeles, he and his 500 staff organizers plan to pursue several ambitious drives at once: 80,000 more home-care workers in California, 5,000 in New York State, 35,000 workers at Catholic Healthcare West, a West Coast chain of hospitals, and more than 15,000 workers at Genesis Health Ventures,  a chain with 319 nursing homes. And on Monday, the 1.3-million-member union will announce a major push to organize thousands of doctors around the country.,Some months, Mr. Stern spends as much energy cleaning up his union as expanding it. He has placed two large Chicago locals and two big New York locals into trusteeship. Earlier this month he forced out Gus Bevona, the president of one of those New York locals, a large janitors' union,  who had arranged a $450,000 salary for himself and a marble-lined penthouse at union headquarters.,Seeing some longtime leaders living so royally, Mr. Stern has begun to advocate term limits for union officials, a position detested by most labor leaders. While the labor movement's 11th commandment may be that ''thou shalt not criticize other union officials,'' Mr. Stern says term limits are needed because it is hard to remove entrenched leaders democratically and because some lose touch with the rank and file.,''It's sad that people sometimes think being a union leader is a right or an inheritance,'' Mr. Stern said. ''When you're a union leader, it's really a challenge to remember that you're the voice of the members and not some kind of powerful figure in your own right. I say at a lot of staff meetings that people who clean toilets pay our salaries to try to improve their lives, and when you forget that, you forget everything.''",STEVEN GREENHOUSE,"FEB. 27, 1999",The Labor Movement's Eager Risk-Taker Hits Another Jackpot,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/the-labor-movement-s-eager-risk-taker-hits-another-jackpot.html
"One of two principal lawyers for the imprisoned Kurdish guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan, has quit, saying his life is in danger, and the other has been arrested.,The two lawyers visited Mr. Ocalan for 20 minutes at his island jail on Thursday. It is the first time he has had access to counsel since he was brought to Turkey as a prisoner on Feb. 16. Jailers limited the interview to the topic of Mr. Ocalan's health and forbade any discussion of his case.,Nationalist demonstrators pelted the lawyers' van with stones and shouted ''Shame!'' as they made their way to the meeting. Today the lawyers called a news conference, and one of them, Osman Baydemir, was arrested before he could arrive. A police spokesman said a warrant against the lawyer had been issued earlier on charges of maintaining links to Mr. Ocalan's guerrilla group.,Later the other lawyer, Ahmed Zeki Okcuoglu, said he could not continue because ''my life is in danger and I am unable to do my job.'',''I am not being protected by the state, whose duty it is to protect me,'' Mr. Okcuoglu said. ''I could be killed at any time.'',Turkey is in an emotional fervor over the arrest of Mr. Ocalan and his coming trial. He is intensely reviled here, and the press has been whipping up hatred by denouncing him as ''the murderer of 30,000'' and ''the baby killer.'',Newspapers have also been carrying what they say are leaked versions of Mr. Ocalan's statements to interrogators. In them, he expresses remorse for his past activities, says he received money and weapons from supporters in Greece, and begs for mercy.,Foreign governments and human rights groups have expressed concern that Mr. Ocalan may not have the chance for a fair trial, and the latest developments were likely to deepen those concerns.,Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Mr. Okcuoglu had acted hastily in quitting. ''There have been small groups who have staged demonstrations, but the state immediately took measures,'' he said. ''The demonstrations do not in any way threaten the lawyers.'',Mr. Ocalan has been charged with treason and may face the death penalty. Prosecutors and many Turks blame him for all of the estimated toll of 30,000 lives lost in the decade and a half of war between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish Army.,Mr. Okcuoglu told reporters that he had found Mr. Ocalan well but groggy.,''He appeared all right, but he complained about problems in his eyes and ears,'' Mr. Okcuoglu said.,Asked if he thought Mr. Ocalan had been drugged, he replied: ''Probably. His eyes were glazed.'',Both Mr. Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., and the Turkish Government came under sharp criticism today when the State Department issued its annual human rights report in Washington. The report said that disappearances and beating deaths in prisons still occurred in Turkey, and that the country's human rights performance ''is inadequate and needs to be brought into line.'',''P.K.K. terrorists frequently killed noncombatants, targeting village officials, village guards, teachers and other perceived representatives of the state,'' the report said.  ''As part of its fight against the P.K.K., the Government forcibly displaced noncombatants, failed to resolve extrajudicial killings, tortured civilians and abridged freedom of expression.''",STEPHEN KINZER,"FEB. 27, 1999","Kurdish Guerrilla's Lawyer Quits, Saying He's Been Threatened",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/kurdish-guerrilla-s-lawyer-quits-saying-he-s-been-threatened.html
"A Federal judge has dismissed most of the claims filed by a former chief executive of Federated Department Stores, Allen I. Questrom, who is seeking $47 million in additional compensation from the company.,United States District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled on Thursday, however, that Mr. Questrom could pursue one claim in his suit: that the method used to determine his compensation was flawed.,When Mr. Questrom left Federated in 1997, the company paid him incentive compensation of $16 million. He contends that he should have received $63 million.,''We're very pleased with the decision, and we believe the facts will clearly support our position on the one remaining issue in the case when this is heard,'' said Carol Sanger, Federated's vice president for corporate affairs.,Mr. Questrom also claimed victory. ''The court denied Federated's motion to dismiss the case,'' a spokesman for Mr. Questrom said. ''It said Mr. Questrom's lawsuit can continue.'',The spokesman said that Mr. Questrom would be entitled to a reappraisal if the court found that the compensation was not in accordance with industry standards, as Mr. Questrom contended.,Mr. Questrom became chief executive of Federated in 1990, after holding the same position at the Neiman Marcus Group, and had the task of leading the company out of bankruptcy. As a spur to his efforts, his contract provided that he would receive incentive compensation calculated as a fixed percentage of the increase in Federated's equity value between 1990 and 1995.,The contract specified that a third party would determine what the change in equity value was. Federated later selected J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. to assess the company's equity value, and Mr. Questrom did not object.,Although Judge Kaplan dismissed most of Mr. Questrom's challenges to Morgan's calculations, the judge said he would consider the executive's contention that Morgan failed to base its determination on the market values of similar businesses, as required by Mr. Questrom's employment contract with Federated.",REUTERS,"FEB. 27, 1999",Judge Dismisses Most of Federated Ex-Chief's Suit,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/business/judge-dismisses-most-of-federated-ex-chief-s-suit.html
"Journalists and media lawyers said yesterday they were worried that a Federal court ruling that it is unconstitutional for the Police Department to display prisoners for the benefit of the press may be construed too broadly and used to further restrict access to the police at a time when the department's practices are under critical scrutiny.,The Police Department has suspended the practice, known as perp walks, while it reviews the ruling, which was issued Thursday by Judge Allen G. Schwartz of Federal District Court in Manhattan.,But in the meantime, there was some confusion among city and police officials about how broadly the ruling was meant to apply, and how it might affect police work.,And some reporters, who have already been complaining that it has become more difficult in recent years to obtain information from the Police Department, said they were concerned that the ending of the perp walks could add to their problems in covering crime. .,Technically, Judge Schwartz's decision covers only the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx and six suburban counties, but does not include Brooklyn, Queens or Staten Island. But the Police Department will stop arranging perp walks in all five boroughs, said Michael D. Hess, the city's Corporation Counsel, until the decision is reviewed fully.,''It is important and it is unusual, and the judge sort of broke new ground here,'' Mr. Hess said.,In his ruling, Judge Schwartz made clear that he was repelled by what he described as the press's role in the perp walk that was before him in connection with a lawsuit by a doorman at an Upper East Side apartment building who had been arrested in a suspected burglary. (The charge was later dismissed.),A police detective had taken the suspect, John Lauro Jr., out of the 19th Precinct in handcuffs, placed him in a police car, driven around the block, and then returned him to the station house, all for the benefit of the local Fox television station, WNYW, the judge said.,Although Mr. Lauro has not sued WNYW, Judge Schwartz suggested that he might have had a case against the station because of the role that it played.,It was unlikely that the police would have undertaken the perp walk without ''the participation, encouragement, and aid of the press,'' Judge Schwartz wrote.,A lawyer for the station, Muriel H. Reis, said she had no details about the 1995 incident, but that the station has a strict policy against the staging of news. Judge Schwartz said he was specifically addressing the staged parading of a suspect outside of a police precinct ''pursuant to a request from the media.'',That seems to suggest that if the Police Department planned to move a prisoner for routine processing -- and advised the news media -- that may not be a problem.,The judge also asked whether there was any legitimate law enforcement objective for such an infringement on a suspect's privacy.,In the case of the doorman, Judge Schwartz said, ''there was none, making the distastefulness of the perp walk all the more apparent.''He said the walk had humiliated the suspect and titillated the public.,The judge seemed to leave open the possibility that a perp walk might pass constitutional muster if it had a legitimate law enforcement purpose.,But one First Amendment expert, Floyd Abrams, said that the judge had ''undervalued the genuine public purpose served in having the public see who has been accused of a crime.'',Mr. Abrams also said that while the ruling was an ''extraordinarily scholarly'' analysis of ''a previously unresolved constitutional issue,'' he was troubled by its suggestion that Mr. Lauro might have a case against WNYW because it had sought to have the prisoner made available.,If such a result were allowed, Mr. Abrams said, ''then we will have broken down completely the longstanding legal distinction between private actors and public actors, between the press in its role as observer and the police in its role as public servant.'',Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that perp walks can be justified on the ground that they afford the public ''the opportunity to see what the condition is of the accused,'' such as whether he has been beaten or mistreated.,The perp walk ''does have an honorable purpose,'' she said, ''which is to allow the public to have oversight of the conduct of law enforcement towards people in custody.'',She said that her organization will consider whether to seek to file a friend-of-the-court brief.,The lawyer for Mr. Lauro said yesterday that he could no longer sue the station because the three-year statute of limitations had expired. But he added that such a claim seemed to him to be misdirected. The station had the right to ask for a perp walk, said the lawyer, Philip J. Dinhofer, but the department should not have complied. ''This is not a free press issue,'' he said. ''This is what the police did wrong.''",BENJAMIN WEISER,"FEB. 27, 1999",Journalists Fear Ruling Could Hinder Coverage of the Police,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/nyregion/journalists-fear-ruling-could-hinder-coverage-of-the-police.html
"Jose Quintero, the director whose reverent stagings of ''The Iceman Cometh'' and ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' led to a worldwide revival of interest in the Nobel Prize  plays of Eugene O'Neill, died yesterday. He was 74 and lived in Sarasota, Fla.,The cause was cancer, said Robert Lantz, his agent and longtime friend.  Mr. Quintero died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.,As a founder of Circle in the Square, Mr. Quintero was also a major contributor to the renaissance in Off Broadway theater that began soon after World War II and continued into the 1960's. It was Circle in the Square's 1952 production of Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' directed by Mr. Quintero and starring a relatively unknown actress named Geraldine Page, that changed Off Broadway from a small but interesting Greenwich Village phenomenon to a theatrical movement of national importance.,Although Mr. Quintero captured the essence of other playwrights' work, he had a special bond for O'Neill. From 1956 to 1996, he directed 19 productions of O'Neill plays. Mr. Quintero often said he believed that O'Neill single-handedly elevated the American theater from frivolity to seriousness. He said that he looked on O'Neill as his symbolic father, and almost always referred to him as Mr. O'Neill.,O'Neill, the winner of four Pulitzer Prizes and the only American dramatist to receive a Nobel Prize, was recognized as the country's finest  playwright. But by his death in 1953 his popularity had diminished. Some critics said that the body of his work, most of it written from 1920 to 1943, had become outdated.,Mr. Quintero shattered this view with his Off Broadway revival of ''The Iceman Cometh,'' with Jason Robards in May 1956, and followed that six months later on Broadway with the American premiere of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which starred Mr. Robards, Florence Eldridge and Fredric March.,Both plays stunned critics and audiences. In The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called the four-hour 45-minute ''Iceman,'' staged at Circle in the Square, ''a major production of a major theater work.'',''O'Neill is a giant,'' Mr. Atkinson wrote, ''and Mr. Quintero is a remarkably gifted artist.'',Mr. Atkinson also raved about Mr. Quintero's production of ''Long Day's Journey,'' calling it ''inspired.'' He wrote that ''it restores the drama to literature and the theater to art.'',In an article in The New York Times Magazine in 1988, Mr. Quintero recalled how he had obtained permission to present ''The Iceman Cometh.'' On a frigid afternoon in the winter of 1956, he went to see Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, O'Neill's third wife, widow and literary executor, at her apartment in the Lowell Hotel on East 63d Street. ''It had been 10 years since any of O'Neill's works had been performed in America,'' Mr. Quintero wrote. ''He had been sentenced to oblivion, convicted of being dark, undistinguished and of no more than historical importance.'',An Obsession And Inner Demons,Mrs. O'Neill greeted him, escorted him down a hallway, opened a closet door and said she was going to show him four hats; he was to tell her which was right for her. He rejected the first three; the fourth, trimmed in black lace, was the one he judged appropriate.,She smiled. ''You come here in search of the rights to produce 'The Iceman Cometh,' '' she is quoted as saying. ''They are yours. The hat you chose was the hat I wore to bury my husband.'',He was to see her once a week until her death 14 years later, becoming involved in her family travails and her battles over the rights to O'Neill's work. She took to calling him Gene. And for many years Mr. Quintero wore O'Neill's wedding ring, which she had given him as a gift.,Indeed, over the years Mr. Quintero seemed to be obsessed with the playwright. A 1977 profile in The Times Magazine described him as ''possessed by O'Neill's spirit.'',''He has O'Neill's haunted, penetrating eyes,'' wrote Barbara Gelb, an O'Neill biographer with her husband, Arthur. ''When his demons converged, he hid, like O'Neill, in a bottle; he talks to O'Neill's portrait and he has been visited by O'Neill's ghost.'' Friends have said that Mr. Quintero, like O'Neill, had an extraordinarily seductive sense of  compassion, combined with delicacy and intuition.,''Iceman'' and ''Summer and Smoke'' were but two of the many plays Mr. Quintero staged at Circle in the Square in Greenwich Village, which he founded in 1951 with Theodore Mann, Emilie Stevens, Jason Wingreen and others. Among his other well-received productions were Truman Capote's ''Grass Harp,'' Jean Genet's ''Balcony'' and a revival of the bleak 1930's comedy ''Children of Darkness,'' which featured Colleen Dewhurst and George C. Scott.,Critics also applauded his direction of O'Neill's ''Strange Interlude'' for the Actors Studio Theater in 1963, with a cast that included Ms. Page, Ben Gazzara, Franchot Tone, Pat Hingle, Betty Field, Richard Thomas and Jane Fonda; ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' a major triumph of the 1973 Broadway season, which starred Mr. Robards and Miss Dewhurst and for which he won a Tony Award as best director; 1977 productions of ''Anna Christie'' with Liv Ullmann and ''A Touch of the Poet'' with Mr. Robards and Geraldine Fitzgerald, and, in 1988, the centennial of O'Neill's birth, a Broadway revival of ''Long Day's Journey'' starring Mr. Robards and Miss Dewhurst.,Mr. Quintero, Mr. Robards and Miss Dewhurst were for more than two decades the classic O'Neill triumvirate: the O'Neill director, the O'Neill actor and the O'Neill actress; they created a repertory and a stage presence unlikely to be forgotten by anyone who saw their work.,Mr. Quintero's efforts also won recognition for many young actors. Mr. Robards achieved his first major success in ''The Iceman Cometh'' for his performance as Hickey, the prime denizen of Harry Hope's saloon, O'Neill's metaphor for the world, where people cannot live without their illusions, their pipe dreams of love and connection and success.,''Summer and Smoke,'' with Ms. Page as Alma Winemiller, established the actress as one of the American theater's stellar talents. And ''Children of Darkness'' strongly advanced Mr. Scott and Miss Dewhurst's budding careers.,Mr. Quintero was a great admirer of Ms. Page's work, and because of her, he said, he counted ''Summer and Smoke'' as one of his favorite plays. Ms. Page returned the admiration. ''What made Jose a great director was that he would do everything by suggestion,'' she once said. ''He would give you the means without telling you what to do. His ideas were so human. So poetic.'',Jose Quintero was born in Panama City on Oct. 16, 1924, the day after O'Neill's 37th birthday; the proximity of their birthdays would become important to Mr. Quintero, who later in life always celebrated both.,He was one of four children of Carlos Rivera Quintero, a Spaniard of humble origins who moved to Panama and prospered, and the former Consuelo Palmerola, who came from a wealthy family. His childhood was not happy. His father had wanted a daughter to go with two sons, and was disappointed by his birth. He  disapproved of a boy whose skin was darker than anyone else's in the family.,''From birth I was branded a disaster,'' Mr. Quintero once recalled. It was the first of his many affinities with O'Neill, whose mother would frequently remind him that it was the pain of his unwanted birth that made her a drug addict. Such beginnings prepared both men for the tragic view of life they shared in their work for the theater.,The young Jose found it hard to  please his father or meet any of his demands; at age 15, taken by his father to a brothel, he recounted, he could not function sexually.,He was educated at LaSalle Catholic High School in Panama City. When he graduated in 1943, he was known for his ability to decorate altars and for his resolve to see every Bette Davis movie that came to town.,His father wanted him to be a doctor, but that was not to be; he had barely average grades and showed little interest in serious study. He was sent to Los Angeles City College even though his English was poor.,He soon returned home to Panama and looked for employment, but his work identity card listed his color as ''brown,'' barring him from certain white-collar jobs.,He returned to the United States and transferred to the University of California. Soon after, he received a letter from his father that contained $500 and a note.,''I once had a son whose name was the same as the one you bear,'' it read, ''but as far as I am concerned, he is dead.'',From a 'Death,' A New Life,Mr. Quintero said the letter freed him: if he was dead, he did not have to worry about failure. He became interested in drama courses; his English improved quickly and by the time he received his bachelor's degree in 1948 he was determined to pursue his interest in the dramatic arts. He enrolled in the Goodman Theater Dramatic School in Chicago.,A year later, he moved to Manhattan. In the summer of 1950, Mr. Quintero, Ted Mann and their partners, calling themselves the Loft Players, took 12 young actors to Woodstock, N.Y., and with a budget of $500 put on a series of shows. Among the plays Mr. Quintero directed there were Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' and Synge's ''Riders to the Sea.'',They returned to New York, and when the Greenwich Village Inn, a nightclub at 5 Sheridan Square, went out of business, they obtained a $7,500 loan, took over the site and began producing plays. They called their theater Circle in the Square, the  circle being a theater in the round.,The Circle's first production, in 1951, was ''Dark of the Moon,'' a revival of the musical fantasy by William Berney and Howard Richardson. It was well received by the critics, ran for eight weeks and won four awards. (After this theatrical success, Mr. Quintero visited Panama and was greeted warmly by his father.),Off Broadway theater, reborn after World War II in Greenwich Village, was growing out of its infancy. Several major groups were putting on plays, but the notice they were receiving was largely parochial, extending barely beyond the Village's limits and primarily involving theater devotees. Newspapers would send second-, third- and even fourth-string critics to review the openings.,Then in April 1952 Mr. Quintero and Mr. Mann decided to revive Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' which had failed on Broadway. The Williams name led Brooks Atkinson, the chief drama critic of The Times, to journey to the Village and write a review. Mr. Atkinson acclaimed the play, the direction and the performances. Off Broadway was on the map; audiences flocked there from all over, and the boom began. Almost overnight, Ms. Page became a star.,''Quintero's success ignited footlights all over the Village,'' The Times reported. ''The American theater expanded some 40 blocks. Critics realized they would not fall into the Atlantic if they ventured south of Times Square.'',The next year, Mr. Quintero ventured onto Broadway, directing Judith Anderson in Jane Bowles's ''In the Summer House.'' By 1961 Circle in the Square had presented 21 plays  and Mr. Quintero had directed 17 of them. When he directed Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' at the theater in 1959, Wilder attended the rehearsals.,Of all the playwrights whose works he directed, Mr. Quintero maintained the closest friendships with Williams and Wilder. He greatly admired Williams and publicly defended him against critics who said that the playwright's work had declined in his later years.,In 1980, he directed Williams's last play, ''Clothes for a Summer Hotel,'' a tale of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, which reunited the playwright and the director with Ms. Page. The play, which also starred Kenneth Haigh, was a critical and financial failure on Broadway and closed after 7 previews and 14 performances.,In his 1974 autobiography, ''If You Don't Dance They Beat You,'' Mr. Quintero wrote: ''When you direct, you're after that shy, inner thing hidden in the woods of your being. But it is not technique that I was ever searching for, but rather the treasure of the blind heart.'',The quiet moment, he said, could be a source of revelation: ''I prefer subtlety and atmosphere. And particularly silences. Silence is as eloquent as words. Characters without some silences tend to be too secure, just people mechanically reciting lines.'',Late in life, Mr. Quintero reflected on his 1956 production of ''Long Day's Journey'' and said it had a special place in his mind because it ''introduced me to that big level of success.'',The Failures Built Into Success,''Success is a terrible thing,'' he added. ''It changes the world overnight. You go from nobody wants you to everybody wants you and you don't know why. You're not prepared to deal with it, especially if you've been educated for failure as I'd been. You're afraid they'll find you out.'',For many years, Mr. Quintero had an intense friendship with Gloria Vanderbilt, whom he met in 1958 at a party in Greenwich Village. His longtime companion was Nicholas Tsacrios, a former advertising executive.,It was Mr. Tsacrios who in the mid-1970's helped Mr. Quintero deal with his drinking problem, which had  dogged the director, as it had O'Neill, for many years. Several years in analysis had provided no improvement, and Mr. Quintero finally agreed, under Mr. Tsacrios's urging, to see Vincent Tracy, a layman and recovering alcoholic.,''I used to fill little bottles and put them in my pockets and during rehearsals I would go away in the dark and drink them,'' Mr. Quintero once said. ''If anyone mentioned my drinking, the fury was enormous. I would consume that much more.'',In addition to Mr. Tsacrios, of Sarasota, he is survived by a sister, Carmen, of Panama.,In 1987, Mr. Quintero underwent surgery for removal of his larynx and was without his voice for a year. He thought he was through as a director.,''When I was told I had cancer of the throat, and I was told that my vocal cords were going to be removed, it meant to me that I could no longer work,'' he said in a 1988 interview. ''And my first thought was of O'Neill, in the last 10 years of his life, when he could no longer work because of the tremor in his hands. And he could not dictate and he could not write on a typewriter, so it meant the end of his life.'',But O'Neill's fate was not to be his. Mr. Quintero learned how to use a mechanical voice box and continued his work as vigorously as ever, beginning with the 1988 revival of ''Long Day's Journey.'' He even created a new career as a lecturer and university professor, dividing his year between the University of Houston and Florida State University.,In August 1996, he directed two early O'Neill one-act plays, ''The Long Voyage Home'' and ''Ile,'' at the Provincetown Repertory Theater in Provincetown on Cape Cod, the town where the plays were written.,That summer, 40 years after ''The Iceman Cometh'' and his first meeting with Carlotta O'Neill, Mr. Quintero indicated that his feelings for the playwright had not diminished. ''Part of my soul,'' the director said, ''belongs to O'Neill.''","MERVYN ROTHSTEIN,RICHARD SEVERO","FEB. 27, 1999","Jose Quintero, Director Who Exalted O'Neill, Dies at 74",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/theater/jose-quintero-director-who-exalted-o-neill-dies-at-74.html

"Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts officially broke off his flirtation with a run for the Democratic Presidential nomination today, saying that to raise the millions he would need quickly enough was simply beyond him.,''I have concluded that to raise the necessary amount of money with only 10 months to do so, compounded by the newly accelerated primary schedule, simply isn't possible at this time,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''I have also concluded that, at this point in time, my not running may be more helpful to our party's effort to win in November.'',With Mr. Kerry's decision, the field of possible Democratic candidates in 2000 appears to have narrowed to Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, both of whom have announced their intentions to run, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has said he is considering a run.,Mr. Kerry said the Senate impeachment trial put him at a disadvantage by grounding him in Washington right when he wanted to be traveling to put out Presidential feelers.,But ''I'm not going to blame it on that,'' he said. ''There's a totality here of the judgment. But did that have a profound impact, losing six weeks? Sure it did.'',It did, but political strategists also pointed to a Gore campaign already so active that it had enlisted the support of several top Massachusetts fund-raisers, depriving Mr. Kerry of an easy base even here in his home state.,Mr. Kerry has an affinity for the Vice President's positions on issues and is friends with him. But even if he were to consider the role of the maverick challenger to the party establishment's candidate, analysts said, the position had already been staked out -- by Mr. Bradley.,''The question really was, 'Was there room on the playing field for two insurgent, long-shot candidacies?' '' said Michael Goldman, a Democratic consultant.,Still, allies who had been gearing up to cross the border to work on Mr. Kerry's behalf in the New Hampshire primary said today that they were disappointed. Though Mr. Kerry's stands on the issues may be much the same as Mr. Gore's, they said, Mr. Kerry could have brought strong personal qualities to a candidacy -- and a nice clean distance from a Clinton Administration tarred by scandal and investigations.,''I don't know how much this Clinton thing is going to hurt Gore,'' said Michael Albano, Mayor of Springfield, Mass., and a strong Kerry supporter who had urged him to run. ''How much is the country going to say, 'Maybe we should look elsewhere, maybe we should look to the Republican Party'?'',Whom Mr. Kerry's withdrawal would help more, Mr. Gore or Mr. Bradley, remained an open question. A senior Gore campaign adviser said today that it would be helpful to have one competitor fewer, particularly from a state right next to New Hampshire.,On the other hand, Mr. Kerry's absence, combined with recent decisions not to run by Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, among others, also meant that those who opposed Mr. Gore would now likely unite around Mr. Bradley, and their numbers might seem to swell.,''Bill Bradley in effect becomes the cynosure of all political eyes as a result of this,'' said Edward Jesser, a Democratic consultant. ''I think that Bradley's ability to raise money will soar with no Kerry or Gephardt in the mix.'',Mr. Kerry told reporters today that he planned to endorse another candidate but would not specify which. He said he planned to play an active role in the campaign.,Asked why he and his wife, Teresa Heinz, who inherited hundreds of millions of dollars of the Heinz food fortune, did not simply spend their own money on a campaign, Mr. Kerry said, ''Both of us feel very strongly at this point in time that it's not appropriate.'',He did not elaborate. Mr. Kerry also refuses to take money from political action committees.,The junior senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry first gained national attention as an organizer of Vietnam Veterans Against the War in the 1970's. First elected in 1984, he will face his next election in 2002 and is considered a fittingly liberal senator for what is one of the more liberal states.,Describing what motivated him to consider running in the first place, Mr. Kerry listed the issues he had wanted to champion: improving America's schools; fighting poverty, especially among children; reconfiguring government; overhauling  health care, and creating a new American foreign policy suited to a global economy.,''My heart loves these issues,'' he said. ''My heart said, 'Go out and fight for these things.' My head said, 'The day after I make the announcement I've got to raise an exorbitant of money and do it all in 10 months.',''And,'' he continued, ''the difficulty this time is, you've got five -- or six, maybe, ultimately -- states in which you are spending simultaneously before even one vote is counted in Iowa. And that's different from the way it's been in any prior Presidential race, and that's what makes it very complicated.'',Asked if he would consider running in 2004, Mr. Kerry said it was too early to discuss.,But Ms. Heinz, who accompanied her husband to his press conference, had a ready answer when a reporter asked whether he would run in the future.,''If he doesn't become a curmudgeon,'' she said, smiling.",CAREY GOLDBERG,"FEB. 27, 1999","John Kerry, Citing Time and Money, Won't Run for President",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/john-kerry-citing-time-and-money-won-t-run-for-president.html
"The career of Duke Ellington is wonderfully logical; each successive step brings more resources to the music, so that it becomes richer and more varied, sometimes in surprising ways.,On Thursday night at Alice Tully Hall, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, as a part of Jazz at Lincoln Center, celebrated the period of Ellington's career that started in 1939 and ended in 1942. Those years were  an especially fertile time for Ellington. His collaborations with Billy Strayhorn were reaching a new level, and his band included the saxophonist Ben Webster and the bassist Jimmy Blanton. The music, often heard in three-minute compositions, is immensely sophisticated, and even within the confines of the three-minute form it sounds unconfined.,Take ''Ko Ko,'' Ellington's blues from 1940. In the hands of the pianist John Lewis, who conducted the orchestra with subtlety and power, the piece took on its original complexity, piling harmonies on top of harmonies, and the melodies and counter melodies that rustle below the surface of the brass were perfectly articulated. Mr. Lewis let the band rock a bit, encouraging a sense of euphoria, and the piece, a prime example of American modernism, bristled with experimentation and a dance logic.,Mr. Lewis may be the perfect conductor of this epoch of Ellington in repertory, in part because he heard the band in question in 1939 and 1940, but also because his own sense of moderation is equal to Ellington's. For his reading of the pop song ''Chloe,'' arranged by Ellington, he had the band clearly articulate the changing textures of the piece, from the quietude of the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon playing against the rhythm section to the smoothness of the full band. He regularly let Mr. Gordon, who played with a mute and plunger, take on the role of Tricky Sam Nanton, ripping ideas through the cloth of the orchestra. Mr. Gordon was the star of the show, using rhythmically sure ideas and repetitions through his solos.,The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who usually conducts the orchestra, came out to take on the role of Cootie Williams, one of Ellington's more important trumpeters, for ''Concerto for Cootie,'' growling and talking through the performance, taking off his mute and plunger for a central theme.,Mr. Lewis also expanded some of the improvisational sections. In ''Cottontail'' there were solos by  three tenor saxophonists, Loren Schoenburg, Victor Goines and Walter Blanding Jr. In ''Sepia Panorama,'' Mr. Lewis let the trio solo at will. Even the set improvisations -- Ray Nance's solo on ''Take the A Train,'' Ben Webster's on ''Cottontail'' -- were paraphrased at best, and the trumpeter Ryan Kisor's solo, a far departure from Mr. Nance's, enriched the performance. The concert will be repeated tonight.",PETER WATROUS,"FEB. 27, 1999",JAZZ REVIEW; An Ellington of Short Takes,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/jazz-review-an-ellington-of-short-takes.html
"To the Editor:,In a Feb. 20 Arts & Ideas pages  article on how the Internet has changed the English language, Sven Birkerts, an English professor at Bennington College, laments the quality of English used in E-mail and in chat rooms: ''I never see a sentence with a semicolon in it anymore,'' he complains, ''the prose of the age . . . is almost overwhelmingly flat, punchy and declarative.'',Mr. Birkerts is one of a long line of critics who over the centuries have complained that the English language is not living up to the standards of the past. Unfortunately, the standards we should be living up to are often poorly defined and quite frequently are only one person's opinion.,When you're in a chat room, language is exchanged very rapidly.

But there were nevertheless signs that once-sacred programs may soon come in for an overhaul.,Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, who is in the midst of a six-month term as president of the European Union, is pushing hard to scale back the subsidies and production quotas for milk, beef and scores of other products that help farmers but keep consumer prices artificially high.,Germany contributes nearly $25 billion a year to the European Union, far more than any other country and more than twice what it gets back through economic or social programs.,Farm programs constitute nearly half of the European Union's $100 billion budget, and they are probably its most politically sensitive component. On Monday, as European farm ministers began a fruitless four-day effort to negotiate changes, 30,000 farmers demonstrated loudly in Brussels. And today, dairy farmers posted hundreds of protest signs on the road leading up to Petersburg castle, just outside of Bonn, where European leaders are holding a summit meeting.,The leaders spent most of their time today staking out rival positions, in preparation for negotiations in the weeks ahead. They will hold a more formal summit conference in Berlin on March 25, and are hoping to complete a deal then.,The issue is not just saving money in the European budget. The European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, argues that farm programs must be scaled back if the union is to proceed with plans to admit Central European countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.,Farm prices in all the Central European countries are far below those in Western Europe, and those countries' entry into Europe's internal free-trade zone would create unmanageable imbalances if the price disparities were still in force.,The issue also affects Europe's negotiating position in the next round of world trade talks. As long as their agricultural markets remain highly protected and artificially overpriced, European officials argue, their bargaining position will be weak against big farm exporters like the United States and Canada.,''Solidarity between rich and poor is important, because the poor are entitled to it,'' Mr. Schroder said shortly after the summit meeting adjourned. ''But solidarity is not a one-way street.'',President Jacques Chirac of France, whose country receives by far the most farm support, rejected some of Mr. Schroder's basic ideas for reform -- particularly his idea that individual governments should pay for more of their farm subsidies on their own.,''We must start afresh on this chapter and on a new basis,'' Mr. Chirac said.,Dairy quotas have been one of the most bitterly divisive issues. Strict quotas for each country limit output and keep prices high. Dairy farmers from Germany, the Netherlands, France and elsewhere have been a powerful force against reduction. Net importers of milk, like Italy and Greece, argue that the quotas need to be reduced if not abolished.,In addition to farm programs, European leaders are feuding over other parts of the pie: regional aid for areas with high unemployment, as well as the so-called cohesion support that was designated for Spain and Portugal. Spain contributes about 5 billion euros to the European Union, but receives more than 11 billion euros through regional aid and cohesion support.,Spanish leaders are fighting cutbacks. Meanwhile, Britain refuses to part with about 3 billion euros in aid that was promised at the time it was admitted to the European Union -- even though unemployment is much lower in Britain today than it is in most other European countries.,Despite the intense sensitivity toward reducing support programs, leaders came out of today's meeting apparently ready to keep talking.,''Nobody expected this summit to reach any conclusions, and it didn't,'' said Belgium's Prime Minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene. He said the meeting allowed the ministers to ''see more clearly where the problems are.'',Mr. Schroder said the leaders agreed that the farm budget needed to be capped at its current level of about 40 billion euros, and that the European Union's total budget should not exceed 1.27 percent of its combined gross domestic product.,He said the leaders all remained committed to moving ahead with the admission of Central European countries, which would require a reform of the farm programs to begin in the next year or two.,If experience is any guide, the bargaining will almost certainly continue late into the night of the March 25 meeting in Berlin.,''I'm not going to minimize the differences of opinion,'' Mr. Schroder said. ''But there are always differences of opinion over money.'',--------------------        Stronger Growth in France,PARIS, Feb. 26 (Bloomberg News) -- The French economy expanded a greater-than-expected seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter and unemployment fell to its lowest since August 1995, Government reports showed today.,The expansion raised France's 1998 growth to 3.2 percent, its highest this decade. That encouraged companies to hire, pushing the jobless rate down to 11.4 percent in January from 11.5 percent in December.,The growth in gross domestic product was underpinned by buoyant consumer spending on products like mobile phones, computers and cars. Economic reports from Spain and the Netherlands this week also showed greater-than-expected growth, damping fears that Europe is heading for recession.,The French Government is predicting that the economy will accelerate in the second half, led by consumer demand.

"The Century Plaza Hotel and Tower, one of this city's landmarks and a favorite of President Ronald Reagan, has been sold by the Nippon Life Insurance Company of Japan for $260 million to a group of private investors.,The buyers were led by the Pivotal Group, a real estate investment and development firm in Phoenix. The other buyers were DMB, another Phoenix development and investment firm, and AEW Partners III L.P., an investment fund managed by the Boston-based AEW Capital Management.,The deal is the latest sale of a trophy property by Japanese investors, who invested heavily in American real estate in the late 1980's and stirred a wave of resentment against such foreign purchases.,Many of these investors bought at high prices, and, faced with financial problems at home, they were forced to sell at lower prices in a weaker real estate market. But one executive in the real estate business, who insisted on anonymity, said this was not the case with Nippon Life.,The company, Japan's largest insurer, had been the lender to JMB Realty of Chicago, which bought the property in the 1980's, he said. Early in 1997, NLI Properties, an affiliate of Nippon Life, acquired the hotel from JMB and spent more than $20 million to renovate it, the executive said. Since then, the value of the property has nearly doubled, he said.,NLI Properties, based in Los Angeles, would not comment.

"Under a growing cloud of controversy about an embedded identification number -- and in the face of the most competitive market the Intel Corporation has faced -- the company's powerful new microprocessor, the Pentium III, began appearing on store shelves yesterday in computers priced as low as $1,599.,The lowest prices ever for first shipments of computers based on a new Intel processor reflect both cost-cutting across the hardware sectors and Intel's struggle to keep pace with rapid price cutting in the industry.,Intel, which has dominated the microprocessor market since the introduction of the I.B.M. PC in the early 1980's, is now faced with tough competition from competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, whose AMD microprocessors are slowly but steadily capturing a growing share of the market dominated by Intel, analysts said.,In fact, January data released yesterday showed that for the first time, desktop computers running AMD processors, which are about 25 percent cheaper than Intel's, outsold machines running chips from Intel in the United States. The results were compiled by PC Data of Reston, Va., which collects point-of-sale statistics on software and hardware sales.,AMD-K6 processors, roughly equivalent to Intel's Pentium II line,  accounted for 43.9 percent of all sales in January, compared with 40.3 percent for Intel and 15.8 percent for the National Semiconductor Corporation's Cyrix processors.,AMD, whose gain was largely the result of a 180 percent jump in the sale of computers priced under $1,000, has recently made significant inroads with computer makers. Among the top 10 manufacturers, all but Dell use AMD processors in at lease some of their product lines.,''That AMD has captured at least part of the product line is an impressive accomplishment,'' said Michael Slater, an industry analyst and executive editor of the industry newsletter Microprocessor Report. ''But they are only used in a portion of their products. That's their big challenge now -- not to gain more PC makers as customers but to proliferate more widely in the lines of companies that are customers.'',Still, worldwide, Intel dominates 80 percent of the microprocessor market and continues to set the industry standard in new technology. Like previous generations of Intel chips, the Pentium III represents the pinnacle of personal computing power, with innovations that improve not only the computer's speed but its multimedia capabilities.,The first models of the Pentium III run at speeds from 450 to 500 megahertz. Intel said it was committing a $300 million budget to market the new chip. That is twice its most expensive marketing effort to date -- the rollout of the Pentium MMX, which introduced embedded multimedia capability.,Release of the Pentium III, however, has been marred by controversy over its processor serial number. Though Intel has touted the feature as an advance for security in Internet commerce and for authenticating E-mail and other documents, privacy and consumer groups protest that it will allow marketers and others to surreptitiously track the movements of computer users around the Internet.,When the chip was announced, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and two other privacy groups started a boycott of Intel and began lobbying the Federal Trade Commission and computer makers, demanding that the feature be eliminated. Intel responded by enabling computer makers to ship Pentium III machines for consumers with the feature turned off.,But questions remain about whether hackers or other third parties could turn the feature back on without a user's knowledge. And yesterday, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and Consumer Action filed a complaint with the trade commission charging Intel with unfair and deceptive trade practices.,The complaint asks the F.T.C. to enjoin Intel from shipping any more of the chips and asks it to prevent computer makers from shipping equipment with the chip unless it has been securely disabled.,The complaint also asks that the agency investigate Intel's decision to use the technology.,Because Intel dominates the microprocessor market, the Pentium III's serial number ''has the potential to change the Web experience to one where every move is virtually recorded,'' said Deirdre  Mulligan, a lawyer for the Center for Democracy and Technology.,An Intel spokesman, Tom Waldrop, said the company had been meeting with privacy advocates to address their concerns, but he added, ''We do not believe that there is anything deceptive or unfair regarding our activities.'',An F.T.C. spokeswoman, Vicki Streitfeld, said the agency would ''seriously review'' the complaint.,As for what impact the privacy debate might have on sales of the Pentium III, Mr. Slater said: ''It creates a certain amount of turmoil, and it's going to require some reactive effort on Intel's behalf. But I don't think it changes the nature of the landscape. My guess is that it will be largely irrelevant.''",JERI CLAUSING,"FEB. 27, 1999",Intel Pentium III Processor Makes Its Debut,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/business/intel-pentium-iii-processor-makes-its-debut.html

"One year after saying China had improved its human rights record, the Clinton Administration today issued one of its harshest condemnations of Beijing to date and described some of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.,Released on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's departure for China, at a time when President Clinton has been criticized for being too easy on the Government in Beijing, the State Department's annual report on rights said that the country's Communist leaders had broken their promises to adhere to international human rights conventions and instead decided last fall ''to nip in the bud'' attempts to form independent and democratic political parties.,The Government also continues to keep several thousand political and religious dissidents imprisoned, tortures prisoners, suppresses Chinese of minority faiths, including Christians outside the official church, and has imposed new press restrictions, according to the report.,Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China remains a military threat to Taiwan, the human rights document led Congress today to raise new questions about the effectiveness of the Administration's policies of engagement with China.,Last year's rather mild description of China's rights policies provoked criticism that the Administration was overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the issue as an obstacle to trade.,Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said, ''There is a considerable indignation about the Chinese Government's renewed human rights abuses, its proliferation of military technology and its threats to its neighbors.'',On Thursday the Senate unanimously passed a resolution co-sponsored by Senator Wellstone and Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, asking the Administration to condemn China's human rights record at a United Nations meeting in Geneva.,''What's the hesitation of following up on this strong report with a strong condemnation -- unless commercial interests trump all other interests in this Administration,'' Senator Wellstone said.,The Administration is unlikely to go along with that suggestion.,In a speech in San Francisco today, President Clinton defended his administration's policy of engagement with China, and suggested that China was ''moving away from the rule of fear,'' even though it was ''not yet rooted in the rule of law.'',Still, officials worry that China is becoming a tinderbox.,''There is no question that the Chinese leadership is getting very nervous about dissidents and the opposition,'' a senior Administration official said.,In presenting the report, Harold Hongju Koh, Assistant Secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor, said Secretary Albright would discuss the report's findings with Chinese leaders when she travels there over the weekend but cautioned that even the most ''robust'' dialogue would not necessarily lead to changes in China.,''I think it's a mistake to conclude that human rights in China is entirely a function of what U.S. policy is,''  Mr. Koh said. ''The question here is, how can developments within China, which have led to greater economic freedom, and efforts at legal reform, which could bring about sweeping change, be pressed and pushed through a process of engagement?'',There was no immediate response by the Chinese Government to the State Department report.,Administration officials, scholars and leaders of human rights groups all agree that underlying the Chinese Government's fears about social unrest is the downturn in the country's economy. China's annual double-digit economic growth is a thing of the past and Chinese leaders are worried that the growing ranks of the unemployed will join forces with political dissidents and angry farmers and create a situation beyond their control.,''They haven't had the growth they need to continue with their economic reforms,'' said a senior Administration official involved in China policy. ''Their economy is flat. Exports are flat and there is a real increase in labor unrest. That's why the regime is very, very anxious about political unrest.'',The report gave China high marks for continuing to open up the economy, and thereby open up society.,''Overall, average citizens go about their daily lives with more personal freedom than ever before: Higher disposable income, looser economic controls, greater freedom of movement, increased access to outside sources of information, greater room for individual choice, and more diversity in cultural life,'' the report said.,But it went on to say that economic reform has not brought political freedom and that Chinese who try to openly dissent ''live in an environment filled with repression.'',Edward Friedman, a China scholar at the University of Wisconsin, said, ''The hard-liners in the Chinese Government are increasingly in control and the economic liberalizers have to be more circumspect.'',In recent years, the Chinese earned praise from the Administration for signing two major international conventions on economic, cultural, civil and political rights that include guarantees of the freedom of association, speech, assembly and religion.,China's leaders have said they would respect the spirit of the law until the national legislature ratifies the treaties, a promise they broke with this year's violations.,''There has been a complete disparity in the commitments China has made by signing the various treaties and their practice of flagrantly violating their citizens' rights,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch.,The Pentagon's report to Congress on the military balance between China and Taiwan highlighted how Beijing's deployment of short range-missiles aimed at the Taiwan Straits was meant to intimidate and threaten Taiwan.,While the report said there had been no increases in the number of missiles aimed at Taiwan in the last year, it added that China planned to increase its cruise and ballistic missiles to attain an ''overwhelming advantage'' over Taiwan by the year 2005.,Congressional concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan as well as tensions between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea have added to the overall deterioration in Chinese-American relations.,Those issues will be discussed by Ms. Albright in China next week in preparation for the visit by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in April.,Moreover, a series of anniversaries in China could spark unrest that might further test China's tolerance of dissent. June 4 is the 10th anniversary of the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and, on Oct. 1, the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.",ELIZABETH BECKER,"FEB. 27, 1999","IN A STIFF REBUKE, U.S. ACCUSES CHINA OF ABUSING RIGHTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/in-a-stiff-rebuke-us-accuses-china-of-abusing-rights.html
"Bending to intense political pressure, Hong Kong's highest court said today that it had not meant to challenge the authority of the Chinese Government in a recent ruling on immigration.,The extraordinary statement, which came in response to the Hong Kong government's request for ''clarification,'' may heal the most serious rift with Beijing since this former British colony reverted to Chinese rule 20 months ago.,But it drew blistering criticism from lawyers and democracy advocates, who said the court's statement was a surrender that boded ill for the future of a vigorous and independent legal system in Hong Kong.,The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ran afoul of Beijing last month when it ruled that children born in the mainland who have at least one parent living in Hong Kong have the right to residency here. Chinese officials said the decision, which superseded Chinese laws, was a mistake and ''should be rectified.'',Although the court did not alter its ruling today, it reaffirmed that the National People's Congress, China's supreme legislative body, had authority over Hong Kong. ''The court accepts that it cannot question that authority,'' said the chief justice, Andrew Li, in a terse statement.,Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, said the statement would ''enable all parties concerned to come to a fuller understanding of the original judgment.'' He added that the court's clarification demonstrated that ''our system of rule of law is complete and intact.'',Mr. Tung did not say whether he thought the statement would satisfy Beijing, which did not immediately issue a statement.,If China overturns the decision, lawyers here said, it will cause a constitutional crisis. Under the agreement between Britain and China -- known as ''one country, two systems'' -- Hong Kong is supposed to be a semiautonomous region with its own legal system.,The Court of Final Appeal tested that proposition by asserting that China could not pass laws contradicting Hong Kong's constitution, the Basic Law. The law guarantees residency to mainland children of Hong Kong parents. But after the handover, Beijing dissolved the Hong Kong legislature and replaced it with an appointed body that passed laws making it much tougher for mainland Chinese to move to Hong Kong.,In its decision, the court struck down those laws. Even as legal scholars from Hong Kong and China debate the ruling, hundreds of mainland residents have poured in to assert their right to live here.,Several Hong Kong legal experts said the court's ruling needed no clarification. And some said the statement today was little more than an oath of allegiance to Hong Kong's new sovereign, dragged out of the court by a local government anxious to resolve this dispute before Beijing forced its hand.,''The whole process was damaging to the dignity of the court,'' said Margaret Ng, a lawyer and member of the legislature, which now once again has some elected representatives. ''We are going to pay a very heavy price in our certainty about the judicial process.'',Yash Ghai, of the University of Hong Kong, said he was comforted that the court had not retreated. But he added that the court had been put in an awkward position, since judges almost never clarify rulings.,''It doesn't seem that the government has any understanding or appreciation of the rule of law,'' Mr. Ghai said. ''They seem more willing to deal with China in a political manner and by making concessions.''",MARK LANDLER,"FEB. 27, 1999","In 'Clarification' on Immigrants, Hong Kong Court Bows to China",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/in-clarification-on-immigrants-hong-kong-court-bows-to-china.html
"Seven public housing developments, built to comply with a 1986 court desegregation order that was fiercely opposed by this city, have not adversely affected property values, according to an assessment by researchers at Harvard, Columbia and Michigan State Universities.,In addition, the study, published this month in the Journal of the American Planning Association, found that there was no significant ''white flight,'' and that most white residents living near the housing developments said they would recommend their neighborhood as a good place to live, mirroring the responses of white residents living in other parts of the city.,''There's a feeling around town that the sky didn't fall, and that it's time to move on,'' said a researcher, Xavier de Souza Briggs, a deputy assistant secretary of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.,The study is the first in the assessment of the long-term impact of desegregation on property values and personal attitudes in Yonkers, which for years has been regarded as a volatile laboratory for issues of housing, race and education.,The dispute dates to the early 1980's, when the City Council defied a court order to provide hundreds of units of housing for low-income and middle-income families -- who were predominantly black and Hispanic -- in mostly white neighborhoods.,By 1993, after the court had imposed more than $1 million in fines against the city for its noncompliance, the city relented. Eventually, it provided seven sites for 200 units of housing for low-income people.,Although at first there was much wariness, there were no explosive incidents at any of the sites, and that gradually assuaged fears, said Robert L. Crain, a professor of sociology and education at Teachers College of Columbia University, who also conducted research for the study.,The researchers examined home sales data for 3,101 homes from 1986 to 1998, and conducted a survey of almost 700 homeowners.,They found that there was no negative impact on property values within a quarter-mile of the housing developments, Mr. Briggs said. And they found that of the white residents who said that they intended to remain in their neighborhoods for a long time, a greater percentage lived near the housing developments than in other parts of the city.,Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mayor John D. Spencer of Yonkers, said that the Mayor had not yet read the entire 23-page study. But Mr. Madden said that, based on a summary of the report, ''we're happy with the findings.'',The report did caution that much more statistical analysis had to be done, over a longer period of time. Indeed, the report said that it had been difficult to verify what many local real estate agents have said: that houses closest to the housing developments have dropped in value by up to 30 percent.,But researchers took solace in the findings that most people said it was time for Yonkers to move beyond the housing controversy, and '' figure out ways that all racial and ethnic groups can work together.''",DAVID W.

"After struggling in pain for most of the season, Wayne Gretzky finally could play no longer.,Since joining the Rangers in 1996, Gretzky had never missed a game, but last night he watched his teammates defeat the Phoenix Coyotes, 3-0, from a luxury box high above the ice at Madison Square Garden. The Great One has a bulging disk in his neck that will sideline him for at least two weeks.,Gretzky, who had played in 223 consecutive games, had been treating the injury to a cervical disk with aspirin and heat for months. But after a magnetic resonance imaging test on Wednesday, it was decided that complete rest was the best solution.,The Rangers moved up Manny Malhotra and Marc Savard into prominent roles and brought up 21-year-old Christian Dube to fill Gretzky's spot on the roster.,If this is the next generation for the Rangers, it passed the first test, with help on both ends from veterans like John MacLean, Adam Graves, Brian Leetch and Mike Richter.,Malhotra scored the first goal and MacLean scored twice, then left the game in the hands of the defense. Lacking Gretzky's glitter, the Rangers put together a complete effort that has been a rarity this season.,''We addressed the loss of Wayne,'' Rangers Coach John Muckler said. ''It's a major loss. We talked about what we had to do to compensate. People had to step up. We asked for overachievers and we had some tonight.'',Malhotra scored his seventh goal of the season when he took a perfect lead pass from Niklas Sundstrom and broke in alone on Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, slipping a backhand around him.,''I felt really good just to be able to know that I was going to be in the game regularly,'' Malhotra said. ''I tried not to look at it as a pressure situation. Obviously, I want to be able to perform well to prove to coach that I was able to take that spot whenever a situation like this would arise. I was happy to get out there and get the bugs out early.'',Adam Graves added: ''I thought that we got contributions from everyone and the key goal was the first scored by Manny, and it couldn't happen to a better guy. You look through the lines and I thought you couldn't pick one guy that didn't have a good game for us. For us to be successful, that's what we need.'',MacLean made the score 2-0 thanks to the work of Graves, who carried the puck the length of the ice, moving from left to right. His shot was stopped, but both Coyote defensemen chased him, and after he recovered the puck behind the net, he found MacLean, who scored with 18 seconds to play in the first period.,MacLean scored again on a power play at 2 minutes 43 seconds of the second period, deflecting in a wrist shot from the left point by Leetch.,With the lead in hand early, the Rangers turned to a more concentrated defensive effort. Richter played flawlessly in net, and Leetch and Ulf Samuelsson repeatedly frustrated the Coyotes' scoring attempts.,''I do think that everybody dug down a little deeper, took less chances,'' said Richter, who had 25 saves.,The loss of Gretzky came at a time when the Rangers could hardly afford another injury. They are already without Todd Harvey, Jeff Beukeboom and Peter Popovic, and have begun a three-game homestand that will also include games against Philadelphia and Dallas.,''I'm in uncomfortable pain right now where I couldn't play if I wanted to,'' Gretzky said before the game. ''I tried to play as hard as I could and for as long as I could. Finally, I couldn't play any longer.,''I've been periodically complaining of tremendous stiffness in my neck and some light pain in my back over the last three or four months.'',According to Gretzky and the Rangers' president, Neil Smith, team physicians said surgery would not be necessary.,''Something further, surgery or further complications, are not even an issue at this time,'' Smith said. After 10 days of complete rest, Smith said, Gretzky will be re-evaluated.,Asked if the injury would influence his decision to return next year, Gretzky insisted, ''No, no, I'm a young 38.'',For Gretzky, it was a disappointing end to his consecutive-game streak. ''It was nice, because I worked hard and I prepared hard in the summertime to be ready,'' Gretzky said.,''I've loved playing here. How can you not get excited to come to this rink and play in this situation? Every night was fun for me. Obviously, there have been some tough times, a couple times that I was injured. I don't think I continued to play because of the streak. I continued to play because I felt like if I could freeze it, I could still play and contribute.,''Obviously I'm disappointed and I'm still a little bit sore, but I'm not by any means panicking and not overly nervous about the situation. Back in '92, I went through a real serious situation with my thoracic disk. That was a much more serious situation and I was able to come back.

"Middlebury has won the last four men's Division III national championships, but will Coach Bill Beaney and his skaters be included among the eight competing teams this year?,Middlebury belongs to the New England Small College Athletic Conference, a group of 11 private institutions that tries to set limits on sports. Nescac teams, for example, can participate in only one post-season tournament. In hockey, the options are the National Collegiate Athletic Association event or the Eastern College Athletic Conference's East Division tournament.,The N.C.A.A. selection committee usually picks four teams from the East and four from the Midwest. Three choices are automatic: the champions of the Minnesota Collegiate Athletic Conference, the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association, involving the Wisconsin teams, and New York State's best from the SUNY group. That means five at-large choices.,In the East, two at-large teams certain to be invited are Norwich (22-1-1) and Rochester Tech (21-1-2), tied for first in this week's Division III national ranking. Plattsburgh (20-4-1) is very likely to be included as the SUNY entry.,That leaves room for only one other Eastern selection, Middlebury (18-4-1) or Amherst (19-3-0). But Nescac teams have elected to skip the ECAC East tournament and await the N.C.A.A. committee's selections due March 7. One will be left out, unless the committee decides to take five teams from the East and three from the Midwest. That would be a difficult political choice.,Amherst finished ahead of Middlebury in the ECAC East standing by a point and has the better overall record, although the Panthers beat the Lord Jeffs in their game on Jan. 23.,In previous seasons Beaney had no doubts because the Panthers' records were so good they had to be included.,The ECAC East is arguably the strongest Division III league of all. Norwich was seeded first and Williams (16-6-2) second.

"Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, leader of the scientific team that created plutonium -- the fuel used in the atomic bomb that destroyed Nagasaki in 1945 -- died on Thursday night at his home in Lafayette, Calif.,Dr. Seaborg, who was 86, died of complications of a stroke he suffered last August while exercising on a flight of stairs at a scientific meeting in Boston. His longtime collaborator and friend at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, Albert Ghiorso, said that after Dr. Seaborg collapsed, he fell down the stairs and was seriously injured and lying helpless for several hours until he was discovered. He was mostly paralyzed thereafter.,Although he was a chemist by training and occupation, Dr. Seaborg became one of the world's best-known nuclear physicists. He led the research that created nine artificial elements, all heavier than uranium. They were plutonium, americium (used today in smoke detectors), curium (used in medicine), berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium and nobelium.,Besides these new elements, Dr. Seaborg and his team, which included Mr. Ghiorso as chief builder of the required apparatus, created many isotopes, or forms of elements, with differing numbers of neutrons in their nuclei.,Two years ago, Element 106, which Dr. Seaborg did not create or discover, was named seaborgium in his honor. Until then, no element had been named after a living person.,For his achievements in making artificial elements by bombarding natural elements with projectiles that included deuterons, the nuclei of a heavy isotope of hydrogen, he shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Dr. Edwin M. McMillan.,During his long career Dr. Seaborg held many senior positions in government and scientific institutions. In 1958 he was appointed chancellor of the University of California and, at President John F. Kennedy's request in 1961, became chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, a post he held for 10 years.,But although Dr. Seaborg devoted much of his career to advising Presidents and senior officials on science policy, his first love remained ''nuclear alchemy,'' the transmutation of chemical elements into other elements. His laboratory even achieved the dream of medieval alchemists: transmuting lead into gold, although such a tiny amount that the method could never be used to create riches.,Dr. Seaborg was one of a handful of nuclear physicists who believed in the possibility of creating ''superheavy'' elements that would be fairly stable, unlike most synthetic elements that decay radioactively in fractions of a second. These elements, from about Element 114 up to 125 or higher, would form ''the island of stability.'',Mr. Ghiorso, who designed and built the cyclotron accelerator and equipment used in most of Dr. Seaborg's experiments, did not believe that the ''island'' would ever be reached, and the two scientists had a long-standing bet on their differing estimates.,But in October, an international team of physicists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna, Russia, and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California succeeded in creating one atom of Element 114. It survived for about 30 seconds -- an extraordinarily long time for a superheavy element. The shore of the island had been reached.,''I wanted Glenn to know,'' Mr. Ghiorso said in an interview yesterday, ''so I went to his bedside and told him. I thought I saw a gleam in his eye, but the next day when I went to visit him he didn't remember seeing me. As a scientist, he had died when he had that stroke.'',Years earlier, Dr. Seaborg led a major effort to create an isotope of plutonium with 244 protons in its nucleus, and he succeeded in making a small quantity of it. It was this same batch of Pu-244 that the Russians used in January to create Element 114.,Dr. Seaborg's tall, rangy figure was a familiar presence at the world's major scientific meetings. He was always ready to explain nuclear science for anyone interested, and his students at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and elsewhere held him in great affection.,A mural in his laboratory depicted the periodic table of elements, including all the known isotopes of each one. Whenever the Seaborg group created or discovered one, something that happened quite frequently, a small celebration always accompanied the marking-up of the new arrival on the periodic table.,Dr. Seaborg was often questioned about the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. He usually replied that although the huge loss of life in Hiroshima and Nagasaki saddened him, the bombings hastened the end of the war and was necessary. (Hiroshima was destroyed by a bomb containing uranium-235.),When he reminisced about the creation and discovery of plutonium, his voice quickened with excitement as he recalled the night in 1941 when he, Dr. McMillan and the others in the Manhattan Project's metallurgy team, working at the University of Chicago, transmuted an isotope of uranium into a minute quantity of a new element, plutonium-239.,Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born on April 19, 1912, in Ishpeming, Mich., an iron mining town on the Upper Peninsula. His father was the son of Swedish immigrants and his mother was an immigrant herself, and he spoke Swedish before he learned English. When he was young, the family moved to Southern California.,He received his bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1934 and his doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1937.,An enormously popular teacher himself, he often acknowledged a debt to his own teachers. As a high school student in the Watts section of Los Angeles, he recalled in a 1982 autobiography, he nearly missed out on a science education.,''Because my high school was small,'' he wrote, chemistry and physics were offered in alternate years.'' His first science teacher, Dwight Logan Reid, ''exerted a strong formative influence on me.,A high point in his education, he wrote, was the Physics Journal Club at Berkeley, presided over by Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence, who invented the cyclotron, and included such nuclear luminaries as Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of Los Alamos National Laboratory; Dr. McMillan; Dr. Luis W. Alvarez; Dr. Philip H. Abelson; Dr. Martin D. Kamen, and Dr. John J. Livingood.,In 1937, Dr. Seaborg was appointed a research associate at Berkeley, and from then on his career flourished. With the outbreak of World War II, Dr. Seaborg moved to the University of Chicago, where he directed plutonium research.,After the war, he joined the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory as head of the nuclear chemistry division. Later he became director of the laboratory, and died as its emeritus director.,He frequently served as the United States delegate to international meetings on atomic energy, and he was an honorary fellow of scores of scientific societies. Among his many awards was the $50,000 prize of the Enrico Fermi Award.,Dr. Seaborg was survived by his wife, Helen, and five of their six children, Lynne Annette Seaborg Cobb of Grand Junction Colo.; David Seaborg of Walnut Creek, Calif; Stephen Seaborg of La Mesa, Calif.; John Eric Seaborg of Free Union, Va., and Dianne Karole Seaborg of Lafayette.

"The Ford Motor Company today introduced the first design change to make the rising number of huge sport utility vehicles a little safer in crashes with cars. It said its newest sport utility vehicle, a behemoth that would be the tallest and heaviest yet, would be equipped with hollow steel bars mounted below the front and rear bumpers to prevent it from riding over cars during collisions.,The horizontal steel beams hang down six inches from the high-riding steel frame of the vehicle, the Ford Excursion, which is nearly seven feet tall and weighs more than three tons.,Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety researcher, said that if an Excursion without the steel beams collided with the front of a Ford Taurus when both  vehicles were traveling at 30 miles an hour, the Excursion would ride up over the Taurus's hood, crushing it. The Excursion's grille would then strike the base of the Taurus's windshield, causing tremendous damage to the passenger compartment, as Mr. Prasad illustrated with a videotape of a computer simulation of such a crash.,But with the steel beam in front, the Excursion would crush the Taurus's front end only as far back as the front wheels and would not ride over it, leaving the passenger compartment of the Taurus relatively intact, Mr. Prasad said.,The hollow steel beams are designed to bend and absorb energy in a crash, and are mounted about 18 inches from the ground, the height of a car bumper as well as the strongest part of a car's body. They should also reduce somewhat the risk that the Excursion will ride over a car that it hits in the side or the rear and reduce the risk of a car sliding under the vehicle when it is hit.,Any family car hit by an Excursion is still likely to have heavy damage. Collisions between mismatched vehicles are unusually deadly, and Mr. Prasad said in an interview last April that weight differences caused 60 percent to 90 percent of the extra deaths and injuries in collisions between mismatched vehicles. But British researchers have estimated that height differences, which Ford is trying to address, account for three-quarters of the extra damage.,All Excursions sold in the United States will also meet California's criteria for labeling as low-emissions light trucks, Ford officials confirmed today. This air pollution standard is roughly comparable to current Federal standards for tailpipe emissions from cars.,Ford announced in January 1998  that it would voluntarily build all current and future sport utility vehicle models, including the Excursion, to meet the California standard rather than continue to use a loophole in Federal regulations that allows sport utility vehicles to pollute nearly three times as much as cars.,Safety and environmental advocates today were still critical of the Excursion, which will go on sale in the fall. Safety experts said that the vehicle weighed twice as much as a midsized car and was still likely to do tremendous damage in a crash. The Excursion is also built on a stiff, unyielding, pickup-truck underbody  originally designed to carry cargo.,Environmentalists said the Excursion's low gas mileage -- as little as 10 miles per gallon in the city with the V-10 engine -- would contribute to global warming and oil exploration in fragile wildernesses. The Excursion, which has a 44-gallon fuel tank, has three rows of seats that can seat nine, along with as much cargo room behind the third row as the combined trunk space of three average cars.,The Excursion is not only long and tall but wide -- 80 inches wide, 3.3 inches wider than a Chevrolet Suburban. If the Excursion were even a fraction of an inch wider, it would be required by Federal regulations to carry special running lights on the roof and the sides as an extra-wide vehicle, said Dan Holden, the vehicle's body engineering manager.,Ford has not yet set a price for the Excursion, but auto analysts expect it to cost close to $50,000.,The Excursion's steel bars and low tailpipe emissions represent a sharp shift over the last two years in safety and environmental policies at Ford, the world's leading maker of sport utility vehicles. In an interview in October 1997, eight Ford managers contended that sport utility vehicles did not pose extra safety or environmental hazards.,Paul Mayer, the engineering supervisor who oversaw the development of the steel beams, said today that the design for the rear beam had been approved in late 1997, and the front beam's design was completed during the first quarter of 1998. Ford also lowered the front end of the Excursion an inch by adjusting the suspension, making it less dangerous to cars and easier to enter, he said.,Jennifer Flake, a Ford spokeswoman, said the company decided in the fall of 1997 that something had to be done to reduce the risk that the Excursion would ride over cars. Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and environmental issues, said articles in The New York Times in 1997 about the safety of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks  played a large role in persuading Ford to act. ''I've got to believe it gave it a big impetus,'' she said.,The Excursion's front bar is new, while the rear bar is a trailer-hitch bar from existing pickup trucks that will be lowered for safety reasons.,Ford's announcement today came three days before a conference in Detroit at which safety regulators are expected to blame mismatches between cars and sport utility vehicles and other light trucks for thousands of deaths.,According to Federal safety regulators, a sport utility vehicle is nearly three times as likely as a car to kill the other driver in a crash. But this does not mean sport utility vehicles are safer for their own occupants: According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is supported by insurers trying to reduce accident costs, sport utility vehicles actually have a higher death rate for their occupants than cars of similar weight, because the sport utility vehicles roll over more often when they hit curbs, guardrails and other vehicles. Only the biggest and heaviest sport utility vehicles have roughly the same death rates for their occupants as large cars and mini-vans.,Today's announcement marks an extraordinary shift in how American auto makers approach the design of sport utility vehicles, their most profitable product. Until now, most auto engineers focused only on making each vehicle as safe as possible for its own occupants and did not look at minimizing injuries to occupants in other vehicles during crashes.,Ford officials said they would consider mounting similar steel beams on other models. But they added that even the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, both full-sized sport utility vehicles, did not ride as high as the Excursion and therefore might not need the new devices.,Robert Lange, vehicle safety director for General Motors, said  G.M.'s Suburbans, currently the biggest sport utility vehicles on the road, rode lower than an Expedition or Navigator and did not require special devices.",KEITH BRADSHER,"FEB. 27, 1999",Ford Adds Bars to Make a Large Sport Vehicle Safer,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/ford-adds-bars-to-make-a-large-sport-vehicle-safer.html
"Members of the House of Representatives can accept free tickets to professional basketball and hockey games at the new MCI Center in the capital, but they must not avail themselves of valet service or have waiters bring them drinks.,That is the practical effect of new ethics rules adopted by the House in early January, and of some creative marketing by Abe Pollin, who owns the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association, the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League and the $200 million MCI Center, which opened just over a year ago.,As one of its first acts in the new session, the House voted on Jan. 6 to ease its restrictions on members' accepting gifts, reversing the strict rules it imposed on itself three years ago, when it decided that its members could accept only the most trivial of presents.,Under the eased rules, which now conform to those in the Senate, House members can accept noncash gifts worth up to $50, but not more than $100 worth of gifts from one person each year. That translates into no more than two free tickets a year at the MCI Center, House members were told recently by the leaders of the House ethics committee: Representatives Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman, and Howard L. Berman of California, the ranking Democrat.,Mr. Pollin has valued his midlevel ''club seats'' at $49.50 each, although the lobbying groups that buy them in blocks and use them to entertain people whose friendship they value pay about twice that. But Robert Walker, the new staff director of the ethics committee, said that the higher per-seat price includes parking service and waiters.,House members who go to hockey and basketball games as guests of lobbyists are not supposed to use the parking service, nor have waiters bring them refreshments. That way, they can stay under the $50 gift limit.,Having invested so much money in the MCI Center, whose construction was begun when Congressional gift rules were looser, Mr. Pollin has much to gain by encouraging free-spending lobbyists and their guests (as well as regular sports fans) to come to the games.,But the arrangement was criticized by Common Cause, the public-affairs lobbying organization, which has condemned the move to make club seats available to members of Congress and their staff through the generosity of lobbyists. In a recent letter to the House ethics committee, Common Cause said the arrangement showed that lawmakers were eager participants in ''trickery and evasion'' to get free tickets.,When the House eased its ethics rules on Jan. 6, the departing chairman of the ethics committee, Representative James V. Hansen, Republican of Utah, said the tougher rules of the previous three years had spawned countless questions, some seemingly trivial, including whether a member of Congress could accept a box of candy.,''You shouldn't have to have a lawyer stand by your side to tell you what is and isn't acceptable,'' Mr. Hansen said.,Even under the new, supposedly simplified rules there can be complications. If offered, say, four $15 tickets to a baseball game, a lawmaker can accept three and decline, or pay for, the fourth.,But a lawmaker who is wined and dined can accept a meal worth up to $49.99, and not a penny more. If the meal comes to, say, $50.35, the lawmaker can't comply with the rules simply by giving the host 36 cents. The lawmaker has to pay the whole tab.",DAVID STOUT,"FEB. 27, 1999","For House, New Rules Mean 2 Free Tickets",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/for-house-new-rules-mean-2-free-tickets.html
"The Surgeon General and other Federal health officials today recommended requiring a mandatory national warning label on cigars for the first time.,Requiring health warnings on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco but not cigars sends the wrong message, said Surgeon General David Satcher, who will review a new report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services recommending such labels.,''The absence of labels on cigars implies cigars are different and don't carry the same risk,'' Dr. Satcher said.,Top officials at the health department say they hope that the report will push the Federal Trade Commission to require such warning labels. The commission has been considering the matter since April, and while it has the power to require the labels on its own, it plans to report to Congress on the issue this spring.,Most cigar boxes, but not individual cigars, already include a label required under a settlement of a California court case. Pipe tobacco carries no warning labels.,''Why do you need another one?'' asked Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of America.,Advocates of tougher rules on labeling argue that the California labels are not strong enough or consistently used.,Many cigar smokers discount the health risks. Montgomery Kosma, 31, an Annandale, Va., lawyer who smokes a cigar every few weeks, said he figured that he and other smokers could evaluate the risks on their own. Most people who took up cigar smoking ''are fairly well educated,'' Mr. Kosma said, ''and don't need a paternalistic human service agency coming and telling them what to do and making them feel guilty for what they do.'',The National Cancer Institute reported last year that although cigar smokers inhaled less smoke than cigarette smokers, cigars could be just as toxic because they contained up to 90 times as much of some carcinogenic elements as cigarettes. And with higher quantities of such toxins, cigars can create even more harmful secondhand smoke.,Regular cigar smokers greatly increase their risk of mouth, throat and lung cancer, the report found.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"FEB. 27, 1999",Federal Health Officials Urge A Warning Label on Cigars,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/federal-health-officials-urge-a-warning-label-on-cigars.html

That suggestion was not warranted by the report, from the department's inspector general.,As noted elsewhere in the article, the report said Mr. Holbrooke did not enter into negotiations with the bank before intervening on its behalf, and the inspector general found no evidence that the position was a reward for the intervention.",,"FEB. 27, 1999",Editors' Note,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/nyregion/editors-note-530069.html
"Wearing the rest of the world's woes as lightly as a silk scarf, the United States economy waltzed merrily into 1999 even faster than previously thought.,The nation's output of goods and services grew at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1998, considerably more rapidly than the 5.6 percent annual rate estimated last month by the Commerce Department. Other than the spring quarter of 1996, when growth also reached 6.1 percent, late 1998 was the most robust three-month period of the 1990's.,For the year, the economy grew 3.9 percent, after adjusting for inflation. The total output of goods and services in 1998, at current prices, exceeded $8.5 trillion.,At the same time, inflation dipped to an annual rate of seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter, the lowest since the Soviet Union launched Sputnik more than 40 years ago. For the year, the inflation rate was 1 percent.,All this added up to yet further evidence of the extraordinary turnaround this decade in the largest and what was once thought of as one of the most mature economies in the world. It was a particularly remarkable performance given that the economic expansion that began in early 1991 is completing its eighth year,  with no end in sight. If growth continues for another year, the United States economy will achieve its longest uninterrupted advance on record, surpassing the expansion of the 1960's.,''After three years of underestimating the U.S. economy's ability to grow,'' said Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, ''it wouldn't surprise me to see it exceed expectations for a fourth year.'',Joel Naroff, an economist at First Union Bank in Charlotte, N.C., summed it up this way: ''We're growing as fast as we can.'',The extra year-end production reported by the Commerce Department wound up, not in warehouses, but in the hands of customers. Consumers bought cars and other big-ticket items; home buyers snapped up new construction, and there were signs that foreigners, despite their economic troubles, may have at least temporarily stepped up purchases of American products and services.,Even though the Government scaled back its estimate of business investment a bit, spending by business on new plants and equipment, after running out of steam at midyear, shot ahead at a 20 percent annual rate in the final three months of the year. All in all, final sales -- everything but purchases that were put into inventory -- soared at a 6.5 percent annual rate.,The greater strength in the economy was widely anticipated by investors and failed to spook bondholders, who often fear that a tight labor market and robust growth will lead to higher inflation.,Long-term interest rates had already risen sharply earlier this week on reports of strong housing activity and high consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other members of the Fed's monetary policy committee had added to the anxiety about interest rates by hinting that they had some regrets about their rate cuts last fall.,But yesterday, with no signs of inflation in the report on gross domestic product, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell eight-hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.57 percent. The stock market retreated, however, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 59 points, to 9,306.58, and the Nasdaq market index sliding 1.67 percent, to 2,288.03.,To be sure, some of last quarter's strength was exaggerated, which means that the current quarter should be considerably slower. A rash of year-end car buying, which followed the end of last summer's General Motors strike, will not be  repeated. Also, the apparent improvement in the nation's trade balance may be an artifact of the imperfect art of seasonal adjustment. For the last half-dozen years, like clockwork, the trade figures have improved in the fourth quarter only to deteriorate in the first.,Lofty prices in the stock market continue to pose the biggest risk to the United States economy. A sustained drop in the market could easily crack confidence and encourage America's big spenders to go on a consumption diet.,Still, the economy's momentum continued to surprise -- and impress -- the experts. With the snapshots this week, many forecasters are once again lifting their estimates for the year. On average, they are now looking for growth of nearly 3 percent in 1999.,As always, though, growth is bound to be uneven. Trade will almost certainly resume its drag on the economy. ''The improvement was temporary,'' said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs. Mexico is being kept aloft by the strong United States economy, but the rest of Latin America is sinking rapidly in the wake of Brazil's devaluation of its currency. South Korea is growing again, and Japan is showing a flicker of life, but the rest of Asia is apt to remain shaky for quite a while. And Europe seems to be slowing down faster than most people expected. The German economy actually shrank slightly in the fourth quarter of 1998.,All this clearly has policy makers in Washington worried. ''The leading economies have got a lot of work to do,'' President Clinton told an audience of political and business leaders in San Francisco yesterday. ''We have to do everything we can, not just the United States, but Europe and Japan, to spur economic growth.'',Where the capital spending boom is heading is the biggest mystery. Cash flow is no longer what it used to be, and corporate profits have been roughly flat in the last year. All the spending on new plant and equipment means that many companies now have plenty of spare capacity and little need to build more.,Still, corporate America has not quenched its thirst for high-technology gear, and continued investment to overcome the Year 2000 computer bug may keep capital spending moving up this year. And with productivity jumping at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the payoff seems obvious. ''Companies keep spending money on technology because that's where they're getting the competitive edge,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill  Lynch.,Home buyers, who drove sales of both new and existing houses right through the roof all last year, may be starting to show a bit of fatigue. With the run-up in interest rates, mortgage applications have started to decline; last week they were at their lowest level in a year. If applications continue to shrink, housing starts could begin to dwindle as early as the spring.,But as long as jobs are plentiful, income gains are healthy and the stock market remains at high levels, American consumers are expected to keep spending. Judging from reports from retailers so far this year, there is no slowdown in sight.",SYLVIA NASAR,"FEB. 27, 1999",ECONOMIC GROWTH IN LAST PART OF '98 WAS ROBUST 6.1%,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/business/economic-growth-in-last-part-of-98-was-robust-6.1.html
"Recent images of war, famine and genocidal slaughter have forced relief agencies, United Nations institutions, and others not only to offer help but also to question as never before whether the aid often ends up doing more harm than good.,''The past decade's tragedies have shaken humanitarians to the core,'' Thomas G. Weiss, presidential professor of political science at CUNY, writes in a forthcoming issue of the Carnegie Council's journal, Ethics and International Affairs. ''The mere mention of Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia, Afghanistan or Sierra Leone profoundly disturbs their composure. Traumas in these countries have become synonymous with the dilemmas of humanitarian action.'',Mr. Weiss and others acknowledge the ''bright side'' of such aid efforts: they can relieve suffering, build bridges between warring parties, promote economic development and enhance the protection of human rights. But Mr. Weiss also warns of the ''dark side of aid,'' which includes sustaining a war economy, legitimizing outlaw authorities, creating refugee movements and encouraging parties to play one agency against another.,The Bosnian war is an example of the two sides of assistance. From 1992 to 1995, relief workers and peacekeeping forces ferried supplies to the scarred villages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and set up camps to care for refugees. Yet some critics charge that they were also aiding and abetting so-called ethnic cleansing, or the elimination of specific ethnic groups, the very war crimes that tribunals are now trying to adjudicate.,''In organizing shelter for refugees and making their exile less painful, the humanitarian agencies were both playing into the hands of the 'cleansers' and carrying out their humanitarian mission,'' Rony Brauman, a former president of Doctors Without Borders, an international medical charity, writes in ''Hard Choices: Moral Dilemmas in Humanitarian Intervention''(Rowman & Littlefield, 1998), a new book examining the moral dilemmas facing aid agencies.,Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, concedes that Western aid agencies assisted the ''ethnic cleansing'' in Bosnia and Herzegovina by helping targeted villagers escape before they were attacked, thereby easing the task of removing them from their homes. Still, he says that ''saving the lives of people in jeopardy had to take precedence.'',Last month in Geneva he again warned of the downside of relief efforts, saying it could encourage the West not to press for reform: ''Humanitarian assistance has been used as a fig leaf, hiding a lack of political will to address the root causes of conflicts.'' Nonetheless he insists that the scale of the suffering created ''pressure for action that governments cannot ignore.'',In some ways, the cruel experience of recent decades has been a loss of innocence. Mary B. Anderson, an American economist who runs the Collaborative for Development Action, a Cambridge-based development organization, writes in ''Hard Choices'' that the West can ''exacerbate the conflicts that cause the suffering it is meant to alleviate.'' But she insists that even if aid can do harm, that does not mean that ''no aid would do no harm.'' Aid strategies that strengthen victims' capacity to help themselves may be the best approach, she says, adding that ''Do no harm'' should be the new ''Hippocratic Oath of Aid.'',Mr. Weiss says that private aid organizations are becoming more careful about intervention. ''The watchword now is: 'Don't just do something. Stand there and think,' '' he says. ''Tough love'' is the phrase many workers use to describe this new, more cautious approach to relieving suffering.,The American-led effort to alleviate the famine in Somalia in 1993 has probably come in for the most scathing criticism. In his book ''The Road to Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity,'' Michael Maren wrote that aid was not only ''incompetent and inadvertently destructive'' but also ''could be positively evil.'',Mr. Maren, a former American aid worker, chronicles the waste and corruption of the Somali operation, saying that it wiped out indigenous agriculture and created a new economic system with its own winners and losers that resists change.,Alexander de Waal, the former co-director of London-based Africa Rights, concurs. Western charitable organizations rush in food partly to help and partly to be filmed for television so that they can attract contributions and stay in business, he contends. The result, says Mr. de Waal, is ''a disempowerment of the people directly engaged in the crisis which drains their capacity to find a solution.'' Indeed, a recent study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London concluded that the new patterns of economic interest created by civil upheavals help sustain the turmoil.,In his book, ''Famine Crimes: Politics and the Disaster Relief Industry'' (Indiana, 1998), Mr. de Waal contends that Africa, unlike India, suffers famines because it is not a democracy. He asserts, as does the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen, that famines occur when authoritarian states mismanage the economy and the people have no redress.,Not all relief failures are built into the system; some result from obvious mistakes, some aid veterans contend. For instance, Mohammed Sahnoun, the mediator in Somalia, writes in ''Hard Choices'' that the United Nations sent too many soldiers without doing enough to rebuild Somali society. Meanwhile, the United Nations commander in Rwanda, Gen. Romeo A. Dallaire, complains he did not have enough soldiers to halt the genocide there.,Philip Gourevitch, in his book on the Rwanda disaster, ''We Wish to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families,'' recounts that in January 1994, Mr. Annan, then head of the organization's peacekeeping, played down a warning from General Dallaire that Hutu extremists planned a Tutsi massacre and denied him permission to seize hidden arms to be used for the killing.,Explaining the United Nations action in that case, Iqbal Riza, the official in charge of Rwanda, has expressed regret that the massacre warning was not taken more seriously but argued that the Security Council had given the organization no mandate to seize arms. Only months after American and Pakistani peacekeepers had been killed in Somalia, he noted, the United Nations did not want to risk further losses.,He pointed out that when the killing started, the Security Council's reaction was not to strengthen the peacekeeping force and order it to stop the massacres but to pull soldiers out, reducing the mission to ''less than 10 percent of its size.'',As people debate the pros and cons of specific aid efforts, others are scrutinizing the traditional principles that have guided such assistance throughout the century: neutrality, impartiality and consent of the belligerents.,The International Committee of the Red Cross continues to defend these principles, even though it meant withholding evidence of the Holocaust during World War II and refusing to give the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague information about Yugoslav atrocities.,Cornelio Sommaruga, the Red Cross's president, warns against ''subordinating humanitarian action to political considerations''; it can lead to deals being struck ''at the expense of humanitarian concerns.'' For the Red Cross, neutrality is essential to maintaining its ability to protect prisoners of war and civilians trapped in war zones.,But Michael Ignatieff, author of ''The Warrior's Honor: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience,'' (Owl Book, 1998) argues that in ''the chaotic conditions of the post-cold-war world,'' combatants no longer respect any rules. Today international emergencies often require military intervention as well as relief aid. The skills of political mediators, human rights inspectors and election monitoring teams may also be needed. And a coordinated approach to crisis resolution is something that relief organizations dream of.,''The sanctity of human life is the first principle for all humanitarians and overrides other considerations,'' Mr. Weiss writes. ''Neutrality, impartiality and consent are second-order principles that may or may not be accurate tactical guides.'',Political philosophers like Francis Deng of the Brookings Institution in Washington argue that states with failing governments give up their sovereignty and place an obligation on others to intervene to save their people. At the urging of France, the United Nations General Assembly has established a rather weak right of ''humanitarian intervention.'',But the difficulties of such a political approach to relief are illustrated by the experience of Doctors Without Borders, which in 1994 pulled out of refugee camps in eastern Zaire, now the Congo, to punish the Rwandan Hutu inmates for turning them into military bases.,Within days, other medical charities had taken its place.",PAUL LEWIS,"FEB. 27, 1999",Downside of Doing Good: Disaster Relief Can Harm,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/downside-of-doing-good-disaster-relief-can-harm.html

"Furiously crisscrossing this vast, unruly country on the campaign trail, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo showed at every stop that he was the front-runner in the presidential election on Saturday. The balloting is to restore civilian rule to Africa's most populous nation after 16 years of military governments.,On a tour of the east, General Obasanjo, who has retired from his military career, never mentioned his opponent's name. This was in keeping with his party's strategy of portraying him as the right choice in a watershed moment in the 39-year history of independent Nigeria -- the only safe bridge between past military dictatorships and the promise of a future democratic society.,Singers accompanied by trumpets greeted him with a popular pidgin victory chant: ''Winner, oh, oh, oh, winner! Obasanjo, you don win, oh! Pata, pata, you go win forever!'',Even at a rally for his opponent here in the country's largest city, General Obasanjo was mentioned more often in songs and speeches than his rival was. ''No more soldier! No more soldier!'' the crowd chanted at a polo ground here, barely mentioning the name of its own candidate, Olu Falae.,Today Nigeria's presidential candidates wound up a week of campaigning that offered the country's 108 million citizens no clearer picture of their ideology or plans to tackle the deep-rooted economic, political and social problems.,Instead the candidates spent the short campaign period cementing ties with or trying to win the backing of regional and local leaders who exert tremendous influence.,Among all voters, the one overriding focus has been General Obasanjo, who is remembered for being the only military ruler to give up power voluntarily, to a short-lived civilian government in 1979.,''The country is very fragile,'' Moses Amidiobi, 45, a businessman, said at a campaign stop in the east. ''It's only Obasanjo as a former head of state who can hold everybody together. He is the only one who can hold both the civilians and the military together so that the country does not disintegrate.'',But the Alliance for Democracy and the All People's Party, the smaller parties that rival General Obasanjo's People's Democratic Party, have struck a chord by describing an Obasanjo presidency as a continuation of the military rule that has pushed Nigeria to the brink of collapse. They joined forces by presenting Mr. Falae, a Yale-educated former Finance Minister, as their common candidate.,''The choice to be made on Saturday is the choice between a genuine civilian democracy and the continuation of military rule,'' Mr. Falae said at a fund-raising event in Lagos.,A generation of Nigerians has never known anything but military dictatorship in this country, the world's sixth-biggest oil producer. So the hunger for a new face, one unmarked by the military, may yet yield Mr. Falae more votes than expected, especially in the east. There, many Ibo remain angry at the People's Democratic Party's for rejecting one of their own as its presidential candidate. The Ibo make up one of Nigeria's three main ethnic groups.,But General Obasanjo's party is so strong, its backing by the military elite so solid and the alliance behind Mr. Falae so shaky that the general remains the favorite to take over on May 29. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear: it will displease many.,Both candidates are Yoruba from the southwest. But because of the complex history of rivalry among the southern Yoruba and Ibo, and the northern Hausa-Fulani, General Obasanjo, 61, is disliked by many in his own ethnic group for being too close to the north.,To some Yoruba and other southerners, like Zaccheaus Jatto, 35, a jobless college graduate, an Obasanjo victory would be tantamount to a northern victory.,''If the presidency goes to Obasanjo,'' he said at a rally in Lagos for Mr. Falae, ''this Nigeria is going to divide. We are going to stay in our own south. They are going to stay in their own north.'',In a country long ruled by northern generals, the Yoruba remain angry because one of their own, Moshood K. O. Abiola, had his apparent victory in the 1993 presidential elections annulled by a northern general.,He died last July in detention, a month after the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, the longtime dictator, led to reforms by a successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, and to a series of elections that began in December.,Nigeria's three biggest ethnic groups are believed to make up more than 60 percent of the population, with the Hausa-Fulani the biggest group, followed by the Yoruba and the Ibo.,Elections for the legislature last Saturday kicked off a chaotic week of campaign stops that were held under the dry season's ever-present scorching sun; violence was seemingly ready to erupt at any moment.,''We're begging you in the name of God, move back!'' one soldier yelled to the scores of people crowding the runway at an eastern airport where General Obasanjo's plane had just landed. Fists flew as people jostled one another to be the first to greet the general, even as soldiers struggled to clear the red carpet, using whips and electric prods.,In a square filled with thousands of Ibo spectators, General Obasanjo said, ''Whatever is the highest attainable position in this country, you and I can reach it, no matter where we are born, no matter what name you bear, no matter who you know, no matter who you do not know.'',In broad terms he denounced poor education, bad leadership, corruption. But the point seemed to be not to discuss policy but to show exactly whom the general did know.,Seated in the middle of a red couch in the front row of an amphitheater, he was flanked by regional power brokers. On a similar couch beside them sat their wives.,The message was clear: the leaders would instruct their followers to vote for the general. Party officials would break up the state into government districts and these into wards.,''You divide the wards into units of 20 to 50 people,'' said Edward Natty Eze, 37, a local leader in the People's Democratic Party. Officials would then hold meetings with this group, offering 50-naira notes, the equivalent of 45 cents, while urging them to lean their way.,It has worked most of the time in the recent elections, said Callistus Awoke, 49, another party leader, who was talking with Mr. Eze at the rally. ''But sometimes they will take the money and continue to vote against you,'' he said.,The general's opponent has also toured the country in an effort to court regional leaders. But lacking the general's party money and organization, Mr. Falae, 60, has stumbled. He has virtually ignored regular voters, not even showing up at a rally in Lagos, his base.,One striking example was Mr. Falae's failure to gain the support of a power broker in his own party in a central state. As a result, Mr. Falae canceled a rally in that state and failed to appear at two other rallies in the region.,A day later, the power broker announced at a news conference that he would urge his followers to vote for General Obasanjo.,As Felix Ihenacho, 33, a businessman, said at an eastern rally for the general, ''I'll vote for Obasanjo because there's nothing we can do than joining the winning party.'',Another spectator, Sunday Madumelu, 32, an accountant, said, ''We are not happy, but out of two evils, we have chosen a better one.'',Cynicism was not altogether surprising perhaps, given the colossal gap between the promise of good government and the reality of Nigeria's problems.,''I want him to put our economy right, fight unemployment, provide free education for all and eliminate corruption in high and low places,'' Mr. Ihenacho said of the future president. ''I want him to promote national integration. I also want him to resolve the fuel crisis.''",NORIMITSU ONISHI,"FEB. 27, 1999",Counting Nigerians Before They Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/counting-nigerians-before-they-vote.html

"The Security Council voted today to end the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Angola, after the renewed outbreak of civil war in December.,But the Council left the door open for a new peacekeeping mission if the fighting dies down and said the United Nations would continue its relief work there.,In a report to the Council last month, Secretary General Kofi Annan said ''intensifying hostilities'' between the forces of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebel movement had ended any hope of carrying out the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement. Mr. Annan recommended ending the peacekeeping operation, which has cost $4 billion.,The Angolan Government had also been pressing for the departure of the 1,000 peacekeepers, accusing them of failing to disarm the rebels under the terms of the Lusaka accord. But some diplomats say Mr. dos Santos, convinced that he can finish off his Unita enemies, wants full-scale warfare to resume.,In a statement here today, the United States emphasized that it wanted the United Nations to remain involved in Angola, even if the peacekeeping force is withdrawn.,Saying the organization cannot ''abandon the Angolan people at this critical moment,'' the United States noted the Security Council's readiness to support ''a future United Nations presence in Angola'' and called for ''the successful conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola regarding this presence.'',The decision to close the operation was made at the end of a bad week for United Nations peacekeeping. On Thursday, China vetoed a resolution to extend the peacekeeping operation along the Macedonia borders with Albania and Kosovo province, in Serbia.,The United States had hoped to persuade China to reverse its decision by this weekend. But most Security Council members now consider that quite unlikely, and the 1,100-member force, which includes 350 American soldiers, will stop patrols on Sunday.,The United States and other Council members now say they want to retain a peacekeeping force in the region, even if the United Nations no longer sponsors it.,Closing the Angolan and Macedonian operations will accelerate the decline in number and scope of global peacekeeping operations. After peaking at 78,744 in July 1993, the number of United Nations peacekeeping troops in the field has fallen to just over 14,000.

"For the last six years, the other women's basketball coaches in the Big East have had mixed feelings about Connecticut's domination. They have taken beatings once or twice a year from the Huskies, but they have been proud that their conqueror had given the conference a good name and they could not wait until they and other Big East teams became more competitive.,Now, the competition has arrived. When the Big East starts its tournament today on the Rutgers court in Piscataway, N.J., it will be the only conference in the nation with three teams ranked in the Associated Press top 10 -- Connecticut (24-4) at No. 6, Rutgers (25-4) at No. 7 and Notre Dame (23-3) at No. 10.,Connecticut has won the last five conference tournaments. It has won the last six regular-season titles, counting this year's tie with Rutgers. Both finished 17-1. Connecticut is seeded first for the tournament because of its 56-55 regular-season victory at Rutgers a month ago.,But for the first time in years, the Huskies are not runaway favorites. They have had to rely too much on freshmen, and they suffered through a spell in which four of their six best players were sidelined with injuries. Even when healthy, they have played erratically. As Coach Geno Auriemma put it:,''We've been great, we've been good and not so good. We've had an opportunity to see some of our young players grow. We've been able to go through a lot of changes. I looked at our starting lineup the other night and saw Svetlana Abrosimova was the only starter from the lineup that started the first game. I'm proud how they've responded to adversity.'',UConn has lost to Tennessee, Louisiana Tech and Old Dominion, all ranked in the current top five nationally, and Boston College, a Big East team that spent some time in the top 25 this season. The Huskies have sometimes looked disorganized and have still won. Now that tournament time is here, can they play consistently well?,''I don't know,'' Auriemma said. ''In this scenario, it's three games. Can we play consistently for three games? No question we can do that. Can we come back and win six games? I don't know. If we're as good as we can be, we will. If we come up short in any area, we'll lose.'',Because Connecticut, Rutgers and Notre Dame have the best conference records, they will enjoy first-round byes in the four-day tournament. The other teams will meet today in three afternoon and two evening games.,No one is conceding anything to UConn. Rutgers has won its last eight games and 15 of its last 16, losing only to UConn. Notre Dame has won 14 of its last 15, losing only to Rutgers.,''I like our chances,'' Coach C. Vivian Stringer said of her up-tempo Rutgers team. ''Our team rises to the competition. I believe we'll play with a great deal of energy and enthusiasm.'',And Muffet McGraw, Notre Dame's coach, said, ''We have four very good players, and when they all play well the same night, we are very difficult to beat.'',The Big East champion will qualify automatically for the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. No matter how they do in the Big East tourney, Connecticut, Rutgers and Notre Dame are sure to make the N.C.A.A.'s field of 64. Boston College almost certainly will, too.,''We have four teams who deserve being in the N.C.A.A. tournament,'' Auriemma said. ''After our tournament, maybe we'll have six. We've always been a good conference at the top, and now we're good in the middle.'',His fellow coaches agreed.,''We're probably one of the most underrated conferences in the country,'' McGraw said. ''I think people won't be doing that anymore.'',REBOUNDS,SVETLANA ABROSIMOVA, Connecticut's 6-foot-1-inch sophomore forward from Russia, was voted Big East player of the year by the conference coaches. She was the sixth consecutive UConn player to win the award, following REBECCA LOBO (twice), JEN RIZZOTTI, KARA WOLTERS and NYKESHA SALES.,The coaches voted CATHY INGLESE of Boston College as coach of the year, center RUTH RILEY of Notre Dame as defensive player of the year, forward TAMIKA WILLIAMS of Connecticut as rookie of the year, guard ALISSA MURPHY of Boston College as the conference's most improved player and guard REBECCA BURBRIDGE of West Virginia as the scholar-athlete.

"There is no rest for the weary Big East coach this weekend, the final one of the regular season, not with talk of bubbles and brackets and, most pervasive, the strength of schedule ranking -- the Ratings Percentage Index -- invading every waking moment.,''I can't walk down the street without somebody talking about R.P.I. to me,'' said Rutgers Coach Kevin Bannon, whose team is a prime subject of the roiling discourse. ''If I walk down the driveway to get my paper with bed-head, it comes shouting at me from somebody's window.'',Bannon claims to have shelved his abacus and crystal ball and is not trying to figure out just how well the Scarlet Knights (17-10 over all, 9-8 in the Big East, R.P.I. ranking of 40 as of yesterday) are positioned heading into today's game at Miami. He and Villanova's Steve Lappas, whose team plays St. John's today, say they will not engage in hand-wringing over the R.P.I.,With three Big East teams -- Connecticut, Miami and St. John's -- all assured slots in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament and another -- Syracuse -- almost certainly in, the sleepless nights will be had in Piscataway and Philadelphia. Tim Welsh, whose Providence team plays Georgetown today, probably has not been sleeping too well for a few weeks. The Friars (15-12, 8-9, R.P.I. 60) have lost five of their last seven games and are likely to go to the National Invitation Tournament, barring a run to at least the championship game of the Big East tournament, which begins Wednesday.,Michael Tranghese, the Big East commissioner, is one of the nine members of the N.C.A.A. tournament selection committee who will sit down next weekend to sort out the field. The league's coaches constantly ask him what they must do to get in, and he gives them the same answer: if there were a sure-fire formula he would tell them. There is not.,There are some things the bubble teams can do to help their causes in the next few days, but one word of warning: the R.P.I. makes for nice debate fodder, but it is merely one of the tools the committee uses. An R.P.I. in the 40's, however, means things are dicey.,''If you have an R.P.I. of 15, then you're going to have enough strength of schedule,'' Tranghese said. ''If you have an R.P.I. of 80, you're not going to be good enough to get in.,''You look at strength of schedule, the quality of the team's nonconference play. We dissect who you play in conference. If you have a team that is 7-9 in conference, we want to know what seven teams did they beat.'',A bit of history: since 1983, when the Big East got its automatic bid to the tournament, 77 of the 86 teams with at least 17 victories have gone to the tournament. Seventy of 73 teams with 18 victories made it. So Syracuse, with 19 victories and ranked 24th, seems in good shape, even though its R.P.I. is 45. Another victory over Connecticut tomorrow would put a dead-bolt lock on what already seems safe. One other thing: style points don't count much with the committee, so forget how bad the Orangemen looked in their 93-69 loss to U.C.L.A. and credit their 83-76 victory over Indiana.,''I've never heard people talk about point spreads,'' Tranghese said. ''They are wins and losses, that's what we look at. This is not college football, in which we put so much emphasis on how you win and how you look.'',That is good news for Villanova, which would solidify its hold on a likely invitation with a victory over the Red Storm today in Philadelphia. The Wildcats (19-9, 9-8, R.P.I. 34) did their chances a favor this week by breaking a three-game losing streak -- which included what could have been a calamitous loss to Providence -- with a victory over Penn, which could land in the tournament as the Ivy League champion. Lappas, whose frenetic speech revs up a few more r.p.m.'s this time of year, is not relaxing just yet.,''We could be in, we might not be in,'' Lappas said. ''It would help tremendously if we could do well against a highly ranked team. All the Big East seedings are still up in the air, so this is a big game for so many reasons.'',But no Big East team is playing a bigger game this weekend than Rutgers, which faces Miami -- perhaps the best team in the league right now -- with its fragile tournament hopes teetering in the balance.,Rutgers has lost three in a row, but losing to UConn is no disgrace. Losing to Seton Hall and Georgetown, both under .500 in the league, is a bit more of a problem. A victory today would give Rutgers 18 victories, and, just as significant, one over a highly ranked team on the road. A loss would mean Rutgers would most likely need at least two victories in the Big East tournament to have a chance.,Unlike most coaches, Bannon has talked to his players, none of whom have played in an N.I.T. or N.C.A.A. tournament game, about the bind they are in.,''You're a little naive if you just ignore it,'' Bannon said. ''They've played themselves into position, and you want them to take the next step. You want to say, 'Get yourselves into the N.C.A.A. where you belong.'

"Manhattan Coach John Leonard was on the verge of tears today after the Jaspers were ushered out of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament by Rider at Marine Midland Arena. And, Leonard's career at Manhattan could soon end.,Leonard was clearly frustrated by what he called an unusual season and its painful conclusion -- a 73-46 defeat in a play-in game in which the 10th-seeded Jaspers committed 25 turnovers, scored no second-chance points, and sent the Broncs to the free-throw line 46 times.,Robert Byrnes, the Manhattan athletic director, said he would make a decision about Leonard on Monday. Byrnes told reporters later, ''I did not give you a vote of confidence.'',Since replacing Fran Fraschilla, Leonard has posted records of 9-18, 12-17 and 5-22. He has two years left on a contract with an $80,000 base salary and $100,000 total package.  Byrnes said he did not know how much the school would owe Leonard if it decided to buy him out. Brother Thomas Scanlan, the college president, said, ''I think John has made up his mind.'',''We underachieved,'' Byrnes said, adding that he would take into account the loss of players and coaches during the season.,Alvin Anderson, an all-M.A.A.C. freshman guard last season, left the team by mutual agreement with Leonard, the school said; Frank Drejaj, a sophomore forward, quit, and Tydrayll Coleman, a freshman forward, has not been with the team for six weeks, though Leonard told a school spokesman that Coleman was still a team member.,Two assistant coaches, Sean Cleary and Marc Turner, resigned in December. Matt Kilcullen, a former head coach at Western Kentucky and Jacksonville, was hired later that month. Byrnes said Kilcullen would be considered for the job.,Byrnes said he felt Manhattan would win 10 to 16 games. Nine of its defeats came by a total of 29 points, losses that Leonard attributed to the team's inexperience. Only center Kyle Crandall and guard Kyle Dye are seniors.,The sophomore forward Durelle Brown, the Jaspers' only bright spot today with 18 points, gave his coach a vote of support. ''It came down to game experience,'' he said of the team's poor season.,Leonard's anticipated departure would end a long association with the school. He played guard for Manhattan from 1978 to 1982, earning most valuable player honors in his junior and senior seasons. He returned to serve as an assistant under Steve Lappas from 1988 to 1992.,Seventh-seeded Rider, behind 20 points from Ken Lacey, sank 39 of 46 free throws and outrebounded Manhattan, 34-25, to earn a quarterfinal date on Saturday against second-seeded Siena.,In the other play-in game, Jason Rowe scored 26 points, including two free throws with six seconds left, to help Loyola of Baltimore secure a 75-72 victory over Fairfield.",RON DICKER,"FEB. 27, 1999",COLLEGE BASKETBALL; End of Line for Manhattan (and Coach?),https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/sports/college-basketball-end-of-line-for-manhattan-and-coach.html
"With surprises abroad and critics at home bedeviling his foreign policy, President Clinton today defended his efforts to cooperate with Mexico in fighting drugs, to engage with China to promote political freedom, and to threaten force to bring peace to Kosovo.,Mr. Clinton tried to step back on a jumbled day of scattershot developments and locate coherent themes in a foreign policy that his critics have long complained reacts to world events more than it anticipates them, and abides the abuses of nations more than it prevents or punishes them.,Twice in his broad-gauged, 50-minute speech here, he spoke of the ''inexorable logic of globalization.'' He warned that while increased trade and economic growth might knit nations closer together, without active American leadership they would not guarantee peace, wealth or environmental protection.,''The promise of our future lies in the world,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Therefore we must work hard with the world -- to defeat the dangers we face together and to build this hopeful moment together, in a generation of peace, prosperity, and freedom.'',He went on to list regions and issues where he planned to use the country's troops, trade, aid and cooperation -- rather than its broad, cold shoulder -- to advance his goals.,On Kosovo, the Clinton Administration has faced criticism for setting a deadline for peace talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels, and then letting it slip.,In his speech, the President declared his intent to certify to Congress that Mexico is cooperating in the fight on drugs, despite the widely held view in his Administration that corruption in the Mexican Government has resulted in less cooperation in the last year. [A6.],Mr. Clinton warned Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's President, to exert ''restraint, not repression'' during the pause in the troubled peace negotiations with the Albanian rebels in the once-autonomous region of Kosovo. ''If he does not, NATO is prepared to act,'' he said. But he did not specify what actions might prompt the long-threatened bombing raids.,And on the day that his State Department issued a scathing summary of China's rights abuses in the annual Human Rights Report, Mr. Clinton called for ''principled and purposeful engagement with China, its Government and its people.'',Without referring specifically to the State Department's findings, he suggested that China was ''moving away from the rule of fear'' but was ''not yet rooted in the rule of law.'',''I do not believe we can hope to bring change to China if we isolate China from the forces of change,'' he said. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who is preparing to leave for China this weekend, sat to Mr. Clinton's left as he delivered his speech, in a hotel's basement ballroom here. He spoke to the Pacific Council for Globalization, the Commonwealth Club and the World Affairs Council.,With Israelis and Palestinians at an impasse over the President's latest intervention for peace, the Wye River Agreement, Mr. Clinton declared today, ''I intend to use the time I have remaining in this office to push for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,'' adding, ''The people of the Middle East can do it, but time is precious, and they can't afford to waste any more of it.'',He began his survey of the world -- which his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, called a ''State of the Union for foreign policy'' -- with an upbeat appraisal of the times. ''For the first time since before the rise of Fascism early in this century, there is no overriding threat to our survival or our freedom,'' he said. He then described a fifteenfold jump in world trade since the end of World War II that has raised ''living standards on every continent.'',But, calling for ''a little humility,'' he read a long quotation declaring that an extraordinary increase in trade, travel and information flow had insured that ''isolation is no longer possible.'' The words were said 100 years ago by President William McKinley, Mr. Clinton said, noting that McKinley's optimism was followed by two world wars, the Holocaust, the Great Depression and Communism.,''Had leading nations acted decisively then, perhaps these disasters might have been prevented,'' he said.,As a result of that experience, he warned: ''We cannot assume today that globalization alone will wash away the forces of destruction at the dawn of the 21st century, any more than it did at the dawn of the 20th century. We cannot assume it will bring freedom and prosperity to ordinary citizens around the world who long for them. We cannot assume it will avoid environmental and public health disasters.'',Cautioning against what he called an American tendency to withdraw from the world during good times, the President went on to slot his top foreign policy concerns into overlapping categories, listing five ''challenges'' to the United States in the coming century: building a ''more peaceful 21st century world;'' bringing Russia and China ''into the international system as open, prosperous, stable nations;'' protecting against dangers of weapons proliferation, terrorism, drugs and climate change; creating a world trading and financial system that benefits ordinary people, and maintaining freedom as ''a top goal.'',His aides say that after regarding foreign policy as a regrettable but necessary distraction at the beginning of his first term, Mr. Clinton came to relish the world stage, particularly after 1994, when a Republican Congress stymied much of his domestic agenda. He also became increasingly convinced of the benefits of global trade to American business and of the potential of commercial ties and international organizations to enmesh potentially rogue nations and enforce peace, foster democracy and protect human rights.,Taking more control over his policy, he replaced the mentors of his first term -- notably Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher -- with advisers like Mr. Berger and Ms. Albright whom he regards as peers.,But while he has been credited in his two terms with advances in the Middle East, Haiti and Northern Ireland, Mr. Clinton has been repeatedly criticized for ignoring festering problems, like those in Bosnia and Rwanda. He has been unable to build enough support in his own party to win the special negotiating authority from Congress necessary to strike the free-trade deals that he regards as central to his policy. And critics have accused him of naive optimism that the flow of products and information will ultimately force China and other repressive governments to open their political systems.,Further, Mr. Clinton's go-go optimism for free markets, both of goods and of capital -- encouraged by his Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin -- may have blinded him, critics charge, to the risks posed by furious currency trading to the fragile economies of South East Asia, Latin America and Russia.,Today, he appealed to his audience for help in figuring out what to do about such sloshing of capital in and out of developing countries. ''We have got to find a way to facilitate the movement of money -- without which trade and investment cannot occur -- in a way that avoids these dramatic cycles of boom and then bust, which have led to the collapse of economic activity in so many countries around the world,'' he said.,On a six-day trip through the west, Mr. Clinton flew this afternoon to Los Angeles to attend a fund-raiser this evening. On Saturday, he planned to fly to Utah for a three-day vacation with his family, to celebrate the 19th birthday of his daughter, Chelsea.,At a fund-raiser here Thursday night, he said he had made ''no progress'' in resolving tensions between Turkey and Greece, or between India and Pakistan. He did not speak so starkly today, but he observed that the standoff in South Asia was a reminder that ''the next big war could still be nuclear.'',In the Balkans, he urged Americans to heed the lesson that he has said he had learned in Bosnia. ''Kosovo is not an easy problem,'' he said. ''But if we don't stop the conflict now, it clearly will spread. And then we will not be able to stop it, except at far greater cost and risk.''",JAMES BENNET,"FEB. 27, 1999","Clinton Defends His Policies In Kosovo, China and Mexico",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/clinton-defends-his-policies-in-kosovo-china-and-mexico.html
"In a move to ban explicit pop music concerts, the City Council in Richmond has passed an ordinance making it illegal to give a pornographic performance at which minors may be in attendance.,The ordinance, passed on Monday without discussion, defines a pornographic performance as anything containing an enactment of any sex act, a display of genitalia or an excretory function.,The Council's action comes as concert hall operators and legislators around the country consider a number of ideas, including a rating system similar to those used for movies, to deal with explicit performances. In Michigan a state Senator, Dale L. Shugars, a Republican from Kalamazoo, has drafted a bill requiring warnings to be put on tickets and advertisements for explicit concerts; promoters who violate the law would be fined.,The Richmond ordinance, which covers performances only on city property or at city-owned buildings like the Richmond Coliseum, states that contracts and booking agreements for performers must contain a provision imposing a ''substantial financial penalty'' if the performer engages in a ''pornographic performance.'' Violators will also be subject to ''vigorous enforcement of applicable criminal law,'' it says.,The ordinance is not unprecedented. Irving, Tex., passed an ordinance in 1991 prohibiting promoters from allowing children under 15 into concerts deemed obscene. But that measure did not carry penalties or restrictions for performers.,The ordinance has made many music managers and booking agents think twice about performing in Virginia's capital.,''If there's any chance I'd be subjecting my guys to a big fine or jail, I'd probably not play the city right now,'' said Jeff Kwatinetz, who manages bands ranging from risque rockers like Korn to tame pop acts like the Backstreet Boys.,Kent Willis, the head of the Richmond chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he believed that the ordinance was unenforceable.,''They knew they couldn't violate the First Amendment, so they put a loophole through it that you could drive a truck through,''Mr. Willis  said.,A clause in the ordinance says the performance must lack ''serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,'' which, Mr. Willis said, could not be applied to any performer he knows of who has come to Richmond.,This is not the first time Richmond has objected to explicit pop concerts. In 1997 the City Council passed a resolution canceling a concert by the shock-rock band Marilyn Manson, but withdrew it on the advice of the city attorney. Larry E. Chavis, who was then Mayor, unsuccessfully offered the band money not to perform.,After the performance, the Council resolved to look into a system for rating concerts that used explicit language.",NEIL STRAUSS,"FEB. 27, 1999",City Council in Richmond Votes to Bar Pornographic Concerts,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/city-council-in-richmond-votes-to-bar-pornographic-concerts.html
"In Calcutta, when someone wants to be in a clean and safe place, where politeness is considered important and the beggarly, the ornery and the drugaddled are absent, he can go to the subway.,From Dum Dum to Tollygunge, during all 33 minutes from one end to the other, commuters travel along stations empty of litter and tunnels uninhabited by the homeless.,''Underneath it's a different world from the rest of Calcutta,'' said G. R. Madan, the proud general manager of the Metro, India's only subway. ''Things are orderly, things are clean, things work, no one pushes anyone. Our standards are high, and if anyone varies from the standard, people resent it. It's the users who police themselves.'',He is peppered with incredulous questions that some experienced New York subway riders would ask.,What about muggings?,''No, there hasn't been a robbery reported in 18 months,'' he said.,Why doesn't it stink?,''We don't allow food on the platform or in the trains.'',Where are the rats?,''We have rats in our headquarters building, but not in the subway.'',Why aren't there any ads on the trains for suicide hot lines, acne treatments, laser therapy by proctologists?,''We're very careful about who advertises on the trains.'',Calcutta, of course, is not known for its harmony and hygiene, even if things have been improving of late. Kipling called it ''the city of dreadful night,'' and some have argued that he must have been giddy with generosity.,For more than century, Calcutta, which now has a population of more than 11 million, set the international standard for every sort of urban odium, its name conjuring images of limbless beggars, starving children, wretched filth, teeming streets and insidious disease.,But Calcutta's subway, now 14 years old, has come to be regarded as a buried treasure. People speak of a rarefied ethic known as ''Metro culture,'' defined in one local magazine as ''crudity giving way to civility, littering to cleanliness, the usual jostling to politeness.'',Parmod Singh, a shipping clerk who uses the subway every day, said: ''In comparison to the other things in Calcutta, this is so clean and nice that you feel an obligation to keep it that way. If I see someone drop garbage, I tell them to pick it up.'',Barun Kumar Dey, who supervises an auto mechanics operation, slapped at a pouch he was holding under his arm. ''Calcutta is a city of pickpockets, but here I am carrying 15,000 rupees and feel perfectly safe,'' he said, referring to an amount worth more than $350.,Sutapa Bhowmik, a 20-year-old college student, said she never fretted about ''Eve-teasing,'' the far-too-nice euphemism that Indians use for vulgar groping: ''Metro is a gentle atmosphere, unlike other crowded trains where men take advantage of the skin-to-skin touching.'',Metro's class, some point out, has much to do with social class. The fare is between 7 and 17 cents, depending on how much of the 10-mile route is traveled. That is beyond the reach of the poor.,This is an odd thing, for Calcutta is in the state of West Bengal, which has had an elected Communist government for the last 22 years. The state, however, feels unable to lower the fare further. As it is the Metro, with 200,000 passengers a day, recovers only 37 percent of its operating costs.,''By and large, our clientele is the middle class, not even the lower middle class,'' said Mr. Madan, the general manager. ''Maybe 2 percent of our riders are daily wage earners.'',That raises the question of what in New York is called ''fare beating'' and here is known as ''free tripping.'' Metro turnstiles are surrounded by metal columns about four feet high, perfect for an easy boost over the top. A former New Yorker demonstrated this to a security guard, Joseph Kuttikadan, at the Chandri Chowk station, leaving him goggle-eyed.,''This you don't see here,'' he said. ''This is not a part of the Metro culture.'',Larceny does occur, with free-trippers cheating the system of an estimated $475,000 a year. For the most part, this is done by buying a ticket good for one zone and staying aboard into another. Someone caught doing this is fined the equivalent of $1.20.,Mr. Kuttikadan has been a subway guard for five years, one of only 100 men who patrol 17 stations. Just two robberies have been reported to him during his tenure, he said. As for loitering in the stations -- or using the trains as sleeping cars -- this is easily controlled because service stops at 9:53 P.M. Trains are emptied. Entrances are locked up.,''People are very decent down here, quite unlike up there,'' he said.,Complaints do exist, some because Bengalis are among the world's most enthusiastic protesters, others because the Metro is beginning to show age.,Several escalators and ticket machines have sat long enough in disrepair that their restoration seems improbable. Train breakdowns do occur, and with spare parts in short supply, they have become harder to fix.,Once, in 1995, Bengali excitability supplanted the Metro culture: when a rush-hour train was stalled for 20 minutes, normally patient commuters quickly melded into a mob, assaulting the station manager and ransacking the ticket counter.,Also, while the trains, platforms and entranceways are notably clean, they are not quite as clean as they once were.,''It's getting disgusting,'' Krishnendu Mita, an office worker, said as he sat in the subway. ''If I have to touch the glass, the dirt will spoil my hand.'',Smoking is not allowed, but food -- of a certain sort -- is making inroads. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have managed to place kiosks in some stations, though the beverages cannot be taken onto the platform.,More alarming is the irrefutable use of betel juice. Some Indians are fond of chewing betel leaves wrapped around lime and spices. A red juice is created and it is spit out rather than swallowed. Red squiggles, removable only with acid, have begun to cover the lower walls of some corridors, like the drip of splattered tomatoes.,Sasanka Ganguli, the station manager at Tollygunge, has decided to combat this troubling trend. He has removed all the garbage cans; by his reasoning, the very idea of garbage, while so inescapable in the streets, must remain unthinkable down below.,''Give people a garbage bin and they'll use it for garbage and spitting,'' he said. ''Take the bin away, the garbage will stay in their pockets and the spit in their mouths.''",BARRY BEARAK,"FEB. 27, 1999","Calcutta Journal; Yes, a Hole, But a Clean And Polite Hole It Is",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/calcutta-journal-yes-a-hole-but-a-clean-and-polite-hole-it-is.html
"Bond Prices End Decline, But Stocks Continue to Fall,Bond prices rallied, ending a three-day slide that sent interest rates to their highest levels since August.

"In October, Merrill Lynch & Company held an all-day marketing symposium at the Parker Meridien Hotel in Manhattan for more than 100 of its women brokers. At one session, panelists discussed an on-line forum, to begin the following week, in which investors could sign up to receive Merrill Lynch research if they agreed to be contacted by a broker. The program promised to generate thousands of solid client leads.,''How will these leads be distributed?'' one woman asked.,The brokers ''have already been chosen by their managers,'' a panelist said.,''Has anyone in this room been chosen?'' another woman asked.,Not one woman raised her hand.,''There was almost an insurrection,'' said one woman who attended the meeting. ''It was discrimination personified. We couldn't believe that all the leads were going to men.'',Merrill says that women were in fact well represented among the brokers selected, but for many at the meeting, the lack of hands rankled deeply -- if only because of the timing. Merrill was already embroiled in a sexual-discrimination suit. On Sept. 2, a Federal judge in Chicago had given final approval to a class-action settlement of a case filed by one current and seven former Merrill brokers who contended that the firm had discriminated against women in wages, promotions, account distributions, maternity leaves and other areas.,If anything, that October meeting helped build the numbers of women seeking redress. For even as Merrill Lynch was holding its symposium at the Parker Meridien, plaintiffs' lawyers were holding their own meetings at the nearby Waldorf-Astoria.,''It was an awakening, and the beginning of a groundswell in the number of people deciding to file claims,'' said Linda Friedman of Stowell & Friedman, a Chicago law firm representing the plaintiffs. ''We had expected a small turnout, but women kept coming over all day.'',Tuesday is the last day women can file a claim, and at least 900 are doing so, or 31 percent of those eligible -- a turnout far higher than expected, according to Mary Stowell, another lawyer representing the plaintiffs. Indeed, a typical response to a class-action call is about 3 percent, legal experts said.,The response has been strong at least in part because women at Merrill heard of the suit from co-workers; a consumer class action often involves a more disjointed group. And unlike some settlements, there is no limit to the amount the women can receive.,John L. Steffens, vice chairman of Merrill and head of its retail brokerage division, denied any pattern of discrimination at Merrill and said the firm had long been committed to improving its workplace. Many initiatives have benefited women, he said, including a 13-week paid maternity leave and a flexible telecommuting program. Since the end of 1997, two women have been named to the 18-member executive management committee.,''We are absolutely serious about making this a terrific place to work for a variety of diverse groups,'' he said. ''It's a little difficult for me to comment precisely since I haven't seen any of the claims. Am I going to do something when I get the facts? You can bet on it.'',Some do not regard the industry as terrific. ''It's the last bastion of testosterone gone wild,'' said Marybeth Cremin, the lawsuit's original plaintiff. ''This industry has been allowed to discriminate for years.'',Ms. Cremin, of Wilmette, Ill., said that after getting her master's degree in business administration, she was drawn to the brokerage business by the potential for a high salary and the flexible hours. Instead, she said, she was paid less than male colleagues, not given high-revenue accounts even after she felt she earned them, not sent to training seminars, and penalized when she was on maternity leave.,She said she was dismissed in 1995 after her fourth child, Maryclare, was born, though she had often brought in close to $500,000 in business annually. She filed her suit in 1996, then was joined by seven others the following year.,''I don't expect the cards to be stacked in my favor, I just want it to be an even playing field,'' she said. ''I hope Merrill and other firms will wake up and realize the resources they have in women employees and invest in training them.'',Some women in the Merrill case charge harassment, but most focus on what they see as a pattern of economic disparity. Among their chief concerns are how accounts from departing brokers, walk-ins, leads and referrals are distributed.,Janna Brattain spent 10 years as a broker for Merrill in Anchorage and has filed a claim. She said that after she complained that women did not have the same access to top accounts, she was later dismissed.,''The top men brokers were fed the pick of the business, while everyone else got the crumbs,'' she said.,The suit has Wall Street paying attention, especially since it follows the infamous ''boom-boom room'' case involving the brokerage firm then known as Smith Barney. In 1996, three women from its office in Garden City, N.Y., filed a class-action suit charging the firm with sexual discrimination; the office, they said, maintained a fraternity-house culture in a basement where a toilet seat hung from the ceiling and Bloody Marys were served. The suit, also handled by Stowell & Friedman, now includes 22,500 former and current employees. A settlement became final in July, and the claims process began on Feb. 1.,''It was a wake-up call to the industry,'' said Michael Schlein, director of corporate development at what is now Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup. ''Smith Barney saw this as an opportunity to increase the momentum for change.'',In 1995, 11 percent of its brokers were women; that rose to 15 percent by last year. The firm also agreed to a number of changes. It set a goal of having women make up a third of broker trainees hired -- reaching 31 percent last year -- and of raising the number of women and minorities in branch-manager posts.,Both lawsuits underscore how entrenched the obstacles still are for women on Wall Street. Women now account for about half the industry's work force, but relatively few have risen to top management.,''It's an old boys' network,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women. ''Changing the culture of the securities industry doesn't just happen because of the passage of time. It comes because of the women who are willing to push hard and the men who are willing to support them.'' The large number of women brokers at Merrill claiming bias, she said, ''gives the pendulum a big push.'',According to Catalyst, a group that monitors how women are treated in the workplace, stereotypes have held the brokers back. ''There's a perception that women are not aggressive or tough enough, that they're not business-getters,'' said Sheila Wellington, Catalyst's president. ''As firms determine that women constitute important new markets for them, they'll realize that there is a sound business reason for diversity.'',Under the settlement, the 2,897 women employed in Merrill's domestic retail brokerage business between Jan. 1, 1994, and June 18, 1998, can seek compensation. The process requires an investigation by the firm within 60 days and then mediation. If no settlement is reached, the claim will go to binding arbitration before a panel agreed to by both sides.,Merrill has long dominated the brokerage business, with 715 offices nationwide. But even as it has grown, the presence of women brokers has essentially remained steady. Of Merrill's 13,410 brokers in 1998, 2,114, or 15.8 percent, were women. In 1990, it was 1,609 of 10,464, or 15.4 percent.,Merrill has several ''clubs'' that recognize brokers producing more than $1 million, $1.75 million, or $2.5 million in annual revenue. In 1991, the firm said, women constituted 8.1 percent of the clubs' members; last year, the representation was up to 9.5 percent. Merrill, however, did not break out figures for how many women were in each club.,As part of the settlement, Merrill became the first firm to end mandatory arbitration for sexual discrimination and other civil rights claims. Employees with claims after July 1, 1998, may go to court. Paine Webber Group has adopted a similar policy.,''The securities industry has made an end run around civil rights laws by keeping its complaints out of the court system, so it's a step in the right direction,'' Ms. Friedman said.,About half of those filing claims are current employees, and many of those said they hoped to stay with Merrill. ''We wouldn't be taking this kind of risk if it was just about the money,'' said one woman broker with more than 10 years of experience. ''We want respect. And we're tired of going to work every day 10 steps behind all the men.'',Not all the eligible women plan to file claims. Subha Barry, who runs Merrill's Plainsboro, N.J., office, said she had had great success working from within. When her second child was born, Merrill set up a terminal in her home and added telephone and fax lines.,''Certainly, there were incidents of golf outings and baseball games where women weren't included,'' Ms. Barry said. ''So I went to my manager and said, 'Don't count me out just because I don't golf.' He ended up organizing golf lessons for the women.'',For his part, Mr. Steffens said that the firm was committed to diversity and two-way communication. ''I want to see us promote the best and the brightest,'' he said. ''It's the only way we're going to be able to compete.''",ANN WOZENCRAFT,"FEB. 27, 1999",Bias at the Bull; Merrill Lynch's Class-Action Settlement Draws a Crowd,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/business/bias-at-the-bull-merrill-lynch-s-class-action-settlement-draws-a-crowd.html
"The Arizona Diamondbacks finally traded for the leadoff man they wanted, getting Tony Womack, the National League stolen-base leader the last two seasons, from the Pittsburgh Pirates yesterday for a minor league outfielder and a player to be determined.,The Diamondbacks had been trying for weeks to get Womack, a second baseman. But a deal that would have sent him and outfielder Al Martin to Arizona for outfielder Bernard Gilkey fell through Tuesday when Gilkey refused to rework a contract worth $11 million in base salary and deferred payments in the next two years.,''I thought it was all over, and it felt like a great weight had been lifted off my shoulders,'' Womack said. ''It's disappointing to me. I like Pittsburgh. I like playing for the Pirates. No disrespect intended to the Arizona Diamondbacks, but I was happy where I was at.'',Womack, 29, will be asked to play right field with Arizona, a prospect that makes him apprehensive.

"When Sandy Koufax was asked today about his budding relationship with the Mets' left-hander Al Leiter, the Hall of Fame pitcher replied, ''There's an old saying in teaching: when the pupil is ready, the teacher will show up.'',And what better teacher than Koufax, who once traveled the long road from wild-armed bonus baby into arguably the greatest left-handed pitcher in baseball history?,''For him to be your teacher,'' Leiter said today, ''you'd better listen.'',Leiter spoke after Koufax had made a cameo appearance at the Mets' camp. For Koufax, it was the second spring in a row he had traveled here from Dodgertown. Last year, the former Dodger pitcher had come from Vero Beach, where he has a residence, to speak to the entire Mets pitching staff at the behest of Dave Wallace, a team executive and longtime Koufax friend.,This morning, Koufax worked almost solely with Leiter, jogging from field to field to watch Leiter throw batting practice and taking the 33-year-old pitcher to the side from time to time.,Timing, the 63-year-old Koufax later suggested, is everything. Today, he recalled his meeting with Leiter last spring.,''We were just talking and I said, 'You've been a good pitcher.' And he said, 'Not as good as I should be,' '' Koufax said. ''I thought: 'There's a guy who wants to be better. There's no better thing that can happen.' '',And so, over the last year, Koufax -- who was a late bloomer himself -- has become something of a mentor to the late-blooming Leiter.,This time, the timing was right.  Not so when Leiter first met Koufax more than 10 years ago. Then, Leiter -- who was a minor leaguer in the Yankee organization -- was awestruck by the pitching legend. Now, the two frequently talk on the phone. They meet, albeit less frequently, away from the ball park. Every now and then, the teacher shows up to give the pupil some one-on-one advice.,Like this morning.,Afterward, after Koufax had embarked on his 45-minute drive home, Leiter was asked if he thought his teacher had come along at the right time in his life.,''I think so,'' said Leiter, who won a career-high 17 games last season. ''The perspective and vision you have at 31, 32, 33 is so much broader than when I was in my early 20's.'',Said Koufax: ''With Al, I might have been in the right place at the right time for him. But he did it. He still had to go out and do it.'',Last season was a breakthrough one for Leiter in more ways than his victory total. Throughout his first 14 professional seasons, Leiter had relied almost solely on his hard fastball and cut fastball, both thrown on the inside part of the plate.,Although Leiter was plagued by injuries early in his career, he had experienced some success.,But even though he had won 16 games and thrown a no-hitter in 1996 and had started the seventh game of the World Series for the Florida Marlins in 1997, Leiter was still searching for ways to develop his craft.,Last season, spurred on by the success he had had in that Game 7, Leiter began to use the outer half of the plate, to use more pitches, to vary the speeds of his pitches more.,His spring session with Koufax last season was a revelation. The two became friends, and Leiter would sometimes go home after a start to find a blinking light on his answering machine.,''Last season, he'd leave me a message,'' Leiter said. ''It would say, 'When you get them set up for the outside, nail it.' Then, he'd hang up.'',Koufax has always been a man of few words, especially in the public domain.,''I really respect the privacy factor,'' Leiter said. So much so that Leiter is fearful that he will damage the relationship if he is too forthcoming about what he and Koufax talk about.,Leiter was wearing a microphone today for a coming segment on ESPN, but he turned it off whenever Koufax was near.,Still, Leiter revealed a brief outline of what he has learned from the Hall of Famer. In summation, Leiter said, ''The outer part of the plate; change speeds; use the curve effectively for a strike -- or bury it.'',It is almost as if after all these years of wandering, Leiter -- with a little help from his teacher -- has found the way.,INSIDE PITCH,The Mets expect the former Dodgers right-hander RAMON MARTINEZ, who is a free agent, to sign somewhere next week -- but not with the Mets. The Mets have expressed interest in Martinez, but at least one team has apparently offered a guarantee of $8 million over the next two years. Because Martinez is coming off major shoulder surgery, the Mets will not consider such a guarantee. Boston -- where Martinez's brother PEDRO pitches -- appears to be the front-runner, according to two baseball officials. The Dodgers may also be interested. . . . All the Mets arrived at their lockers this morning to find packages of Topps baseball cards on their stools. AL LEITER's pack contained a replica NOLAN RYAN rookie card when Ryan was a member of the Mets.

"Buckingham Palace guards should take their work as seriously as Roger Clemens does. Even as he threw batting practice for the first time today, the Yankees' new pitcher focused deeply on the glove of catcher Jorge Posada, staring ahead. Clemens did not notice all the reporters circled round the batting cage, all the photographers, or what caused the coach Don Zimmer to bend over in laughter.,Clemens reached into a crate of baseballs planted on the side of the mound, preparing to face the second batter of his session, and when he looked up, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was standing at the plate, ready to hit, wearing a full set of catcher's gear. Mask, chest protector, shinguards, bat in hands.,Derek Jeter, standing next to the cage, wore the same suit of armor as Knoblauch; it was their own special way of honoring Clemens for the many times he had hit them with fastballs before he became a Yankee.,Clemens did a double take, before his face split into a grin that might have spanned Tampa Bay. Then he did what any self-respecting intimidator would do: he threw a fastball over Knoblauch's head, and did the same to Jeter.,All the participants thoroughly enjoyed this rite of passage.,''I knew something like that would happen eventually,'' said Clemens, aware of Jeter's promise that he and others would exact revenge on the hard-throwing pitcher. ''For those two to step in with full gear like that did break the ice a little bit.'',There had been speculation that Clemens would have old scores to settle before being accepted. Clemens, after all, had thrown at Jeter so often that Jeter had wondered why, and Clemens had drilled Knoblauch and Scott Brosius and once stared down Joe Girardi. Heck, he probably had some sort of angry history with just about every position player in pinstripes.,But all is forgiven now that Clemens is with the Yankees. He will knock down opposing hitters in the months to come, no doubt, and his teammates will come to understand Clemens and understand why he does this; when an opposing pitcher drills a Yankee with a fastball, Clemens might hit two batters in response and the Yankees will be glad to have him. ''You like him,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said, ''once he's on your side.'',He is fitting in quickly, advising Hideki Irabu, teasing David Cone about his aversion to running, working with catchers Posada and Joe Girardi. Clemens likes to encourage his catchers, ''pump them up,'' Posada said today, and he's very precise in what he does. ''He's going to be a lot of fun to watch.'',And fun to make fun of: today's prank, Jeter said, was only the first payback for the many times Clemens had aimed at him and Knoblauch. Jeter took full credit for the idea of putting on the catcher's garb -- ''I thought of that one,'' he said, smiling broadly -- and shared it with Knoblauch earlier this week. Jeter borrowed shinguards, a chest protector and face mask from Posada, and turned around his own helmet; Knoblauch raided the locker of catcher Mike Figga for most of his equipment -- the first time Knoblauch had worn catcher's equipment since he was in Little League -- and had the honor of stepping in first against Clemens.,''I'll try to make you feel comfortable,'' Clemens yelled in to Knoblauch, between chuckles, and then threw a fastball a foot over Knoblauch's head, and then Jeter's. ''I thought he might hit me,'' Jeter said later.,After the pseudo beanballs, Clemens said with mock bravado, ''They swung like they always do against me.'' That is to say: poorly. Defensive swings, weak swings, mostly little fly balls to right field.,Clemens finished batting practice and completed his workout on a back field, where he had his first post-trade encounter with George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, who had wandered out of his Legends Field office. Clemens noticed that the pitchers' running seemed to get a little more tense with Steinbrenner around.,''Great to see you in uniform,'' Steinbrenner said.,''Great to be here,'' said Clemens, surviving another rite of passage, before moving on to another field.,INSIDE PITCH,A day after telling a reporter he was comfortable with his decision to retire, JIMMY KEY informed the Yankees he was not interested in their offer to return as a middle reliever. JOE TORRE, the Yankee manager, said that the team must look at the pitchers already in camp before determining if it is necessary to acquire another left-hander. . . . DARRYL STRAWBERRY had chemotherapy after Friday's workout, his first treatments since the opening of camp. Strawberry, who has experienced nausea the morning after chemotherapy, nonetheless expects to participate in Saturday's workout. . . . ANDY PETTITTE, who experienced some soreness in his elbow three days ago, expects to throw off a mound today. . . . DAVID CONE, who wore down at the end of last season, is feeling good. He is willing to ''try anything'' to help his shoulder, including a recent acupuncture session.",BUSTER OLNEY,"FEB. 27, 1999",BASEBALL; Clemens Is Amusing Yankees From 60 Feet 6 Inches Away,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/sports/baseball-clemens-is-amusing-yankees-from-60-feet-6-inches-away.html
"Eleven months ago in Oregon, a woman in her mid-80's took some pills prescribed by her doctor, sipped some brandy, lay back in bed with her family around her, and died. In that quiet way, after great debate across an aging nation, a new era began. Oregon had become the only place in the world in which assisted suicide was legal. Its voters had twice approved assisted suicide, its courts had let the people's decision stand, its public health bureaucracy had drafted 91 pages of rules to govern how it would work, and a woman in the terminal stages of breast cancer had met the requirements to go. She filled out a one-page form, ''Request for medication to end my life in a humane and dignified manner,'' and two doctors confirmed that she had less than six months to live.,She expired in the bosom of her family, but also in an atmosphere of lingering resistance and criticism. Some doctors and religious leaders in Oregon remained opposed, some pharmacists didn't want to write lethal prescriptions, some legislators threatened to revise the law. These worries were reinforced by disturbing stories from the Netherlands, where assisted suicide is technically illegal but has nevertheless been widely practiced for 15 years, supposedly governed by standards established by the Royal Dutch Medical Association. The stories suggested that some people had been given assistance in dying even though they had not requested it.,Now, thanks to two recent reports, the experiences in Oregon and the Netherlands can be compared. A report in the Journal of Medical Ethics strongly suggests that the conflict between law and practice in the Netherlands has created a fatal confusion. In one in five cases surveyed there, euthanasia was performed on patients who had not requested it, and on patients for whom other, untried treatments for their illnesses were still available.,In Oregon, by contrast, a report by the State Health Division found there had been no run on death, no confusion and no abuse. Only 15 people, 8 men and 7 women, were helped to die in 1998. Thirteen were cancer patients, and many, their doctors said, were decisive personalities, or people acting on long-held principles. A pattern had begun to emerge of people dying in gatherings of family after eating barbiturates in chocolate pudding.,The Roman Catholic Archbishop in Portland has denounced their deaths as cause for ''sadness and shame.'' Moral conscience is always grounds for disagreement. But Oregon seems to have shown, on this most personal and final of issues, that it is possible to make law and bureaucratic rules that allow people to take responsibility for themselves, without the state, or anyone else, abusing them. That is cause for relief.",,"FEB. 27, 1999","Assisted Suicide, in Practice",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/opinion/assisted-suicide-in-practice.html
"Ron Taritas was sitting in his office on the lake front in Chicago, phone in hand, dialing for donations. He was not having a very good day.,As one of four full-time food brokers at Second Harvest, the country's largest nonprofit clearinghouse for donations to soup kitchens and food pantries, Mr. Taritas has the job of reeling in the grocery industry's castoffs -- the mislabeled cans, outdated cartons and unpopular brands that will never make it to supermarket shelves.,But eight hours into this day, his best catch was 4,000 cases of Puffed Wheat, Raisin Bran, Honey Smacks and other cereals. Beyond that, all he had to show for his work was 32 cases of chocolate-crunch energy bars from a warehouse in Honolulu, 500 cases of bottled spring water from Tucson, Ariz., and 5,000 cases of Cremora from Columbus, Ohio.,''Some days,'' Mr. Taritas said, ''it's like catching smoke.'',These are anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of America's sprawling system of church-basement soup kitchens and food pantries. Over nearly two decades, that network has expanded to serve more than $1 billion worth of food each year to 20 million Americans. But now, as changes in welfare policy push many people away from the public dole, private charity is lagging ever further behind in its efforts to feed the lengthening lines.,Part of the problem, by the charities' account, is rising demand on a system that was never really able to keep up in the first place. Last year, Second Harvest calculated that it would have to double the flow of food to supply everyone seeking help.,But the supply side has begun to hit hard times, too. Most troubling to the charities is the cooling of their traditional symbiotic relationship with America's food-making giants, in which millions of tons of surplus food products has flowed to people in need.,From the first, the key to that relationship was the industry's propensity for waste -- and the charities' eagerness to make it go away, gracefully. But in the streamlining spirit of business in the late 1990's, the food makers are simply making fewer errors. And so there is less surplus food to pass along.,These days, a mantra of grocery manufacturers is ''zero defects.'' Chicken not good enough for cutlets is pressed into nuggets; scraps not good enough for nuggets are pulverized into pet food. Sales figures from checkout scanners are fed daily to manufacturers, allowing factories to fine-tune their output to match demand.,And in the last few years, heaps of dented or out-of-date cans and cartons have become the basis for an estimated $2 billion-a-year market in ''unsalable'' food. Instead of being donated, damaged goods are exported to developing countries or resold at sharp discounts in suburban flea markets, unlicensed stores in rural areas or warehouse-style outlets.,Certainly, the grocery makers still turn out a lot of surplus food. But over the last three years, after rising steadily for more than 15 years, the donations that are the core of Second Harvest's business have fallen 10 percent. And while a glut of pork and the Asian economic crisis allowed the Federal Government to kick in an unexpected burst of unsold meat and produce last year, demand is increasingly outstripping supply.,Although the drop is not enormous, it has already begun to reverberate across the far-flung charity network. From Second Harvest to the regional food banks and then down to the local outlets, the charities have been forced to devise all manner of new strategies to keep the food coming. They are cutting new deals with the grocery makers. They are reaching out to farmers and fishermen. Mainly, they are spending more of their time and scant money chasing additional, but smaller, donations from local sources instead of big corporations.,Some food pantries and soup kitchens remain relatively flush. But across the country, thousands of others are cutting hours, limiting the size and frequency of handouts, rationing coveted items like hot dogs and peanut butter and seeking unorthodox supplements like road-killed deer, according to state and local surveys and Second Harvest reports. Some are even having to turn people away.,Last year, half the food charities in New York City cut the size of handouts at least part of the year, according to a survey by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, a private group. Largely for lack of food, the coalition has begun counseling churches and synagogues against setting up new pantries and soup kitchens.,At the end of the emergency-food chain -- the men, women and children standing in line at the church-basement door -- that faltering flow of donations is calling into question the notion that private charity should, and can, soften the sting of losing public entitlements. These days, a lot of people in the food-banking business are worrying that a system created as a supplement to public aid is turning out to be an increasingly ineffective substitute for it.,The Charity Network,Source in a Crisis Is Now a Mainstay,Twenty-five years ago, the only food bank in New Jersey was Kathleen DiChiara, a homemaker from Summit who carted canned goods in her station wagon from food drives at churches to people in need. Around the country, food pantries and soup kitchens were almost unknown beyond Skid Row.,But as the deep recession of the early 1980's took hold, followed by the budget cuts of the Reagan era, growing numbers of people found themselves without adequate food. Dozens, and then hundreds, of soup kitchens and food pantries sprouted where none had been seen since the Depression.,Even so, Ms. DiChiara recalled, there was always a feeling that the crisis would pass: Congress would restore money for social programs; the economy would revive.,But while the economy rebounded and Congress provided relief for the poor, the demand for food handouts grew, along with the charity network. And by the late 1980's, people in the food-banking business had begun to realize that they were becoming a fixture on the American landscape -- more a secondary safety net than an emergency source of food.,Today, Ms. DiChiara runs one of the biggest food-banking operations in the country, the Community Food Bank of New Jersey, with a fleet of trucks that each month distributes a million pounds of food out of a 280,000-square-foot warehouse. New York City, which had only three dozen pantries and soup kitchens in 1980, had 600 in 1992 and now has about 1,100. Across the nation, the food network is more than 40,000 soup kitchens and food pantries strong, with more than 3,000 paid employees and 900,000 volunteers.,Almost from the beginning, the food network formed a tight alliance with grocery manufacturers. The charities offered a perfect outlet, allowing manufacturers and stores to dispose of damaged or unsold goods, cut dumping costs, gain tax breaks and get some good publicity along the way.,Soon, the relationship was institutionalized in formal agreements, and food company executives joined the boards of Second Harvest and its regional food banks. But all along, there was a queasy feeling that this cozy, co-dependent relationship could not last. Sooner or later, the food bankers knew, they would begin to pay for their reliance on the industry's prodigal past.,Soon after Thomas Debrowski became head of operations for the Pillsbury Company in 1991, the community relations people walked into his office in Minneapolis and presented him with records of the regular annual donation of several million pounds of flawed or unsold food to Second Harvest.,''They wanted to know if we wanted to increase it,'' Mr. Debrowski recalls. ''I said, 'Increase? My objective is to give them nothing next year.' '',To an executive charged with burnishing the bottom line, in a business climate where everyone was on the prowl for greater efficiencies, the idea that millions of pounds of food was either failing inspection or going stale in warehouses was not acceptable. And before long, like most of the big food companies, Pillsbury instituted economies up and down the production line.,On the line for Green Giant Niblets brand corn, where workers once picked out discolored kernels by hand, electronic eyes now detect the rejects, and a puff of air blasts the offending kernel from the conveyer belt. Shipping containers that tended to be crushed have been redesigned. At a Minute Maid Hi-C fruit punch plant in Wharton, N.J., the process has been streamlined so that the raw ingredients arrive just 6 to 10 hours before a batch of juice is packaged, maintaining freshness and reducing the chance of a bad run. Where previously juice was not tested for quality until it had been canned, continual checks are now made for factors like sweetness, flavor, color and vitamin content right on the assembly line.,Improvements in marketing have paralleled those in manufacturing.,In the wasteful old days, new products were tested according to the Darwinian laws of the marketplace: A company would blanket the nation with various new snack foods, for example, knowing that some were sure to fail. Only the fittest survived. The rest ended up in somebody's food bank.,Now, instead of ''pushing'' products out into the market, as industry argot would have it, the focus is on having them ''pulled'' into stores. That means doing research to gauge consumer interests, testing products in carefully dissected markets before distributing them widely and tailoring production to sales. The result is far fewer stacks of failed experiments and formerly fashionable foods, like the oat bran cookies and muffins that became a staple at the nation's food banks after the fad faded in the early 90's.,Over all, what this means is that after rising steadily until 1995, when they reached 285 million pounds, annual donations from the big national food companies dropped to 259 million pounds in 1998.,To a certain extent, the food charities had become their own worst enemy by making waste so identifiable, said Janet E. Poppendieck, a Hunter College sociologist and author of a new book, ''Sweet Charity: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement'' (Viking Press, 1998).,''No firm is going to continue to put labels on jars upside down so that there will be peanut butter at the food bank,'' she said.,'Banana Box Deals',New Competition For Flawed Goods,At the supermarket, the can or carton of soup or cereal that still fails to sell, or is dented after falling off a truck or store shelf, remains the biggest single source of food for the charity pipeline.,Now, in a shift that has the companies and the charities alarmed, more and more of these products are finding their way back out to paying consumers.,Over the last decade, a host of ''reclamation centers'' have evolved as a way for supermarket chains to tally damage and charge manufacturers for losses. At the centers, leaky packages are thrown out, and any usable products are repacked in the rectangular cartons in which bananas are shipped. Some are donated to Second Harvest, particularly if the manufacturer requested that option. But, more and more, the cans and cartons are sold, at pennies on the dollar, to wholesalers who sell them yet again.,One recent posting on a Web site for salvaged goods, by a Massachusetts company called I-ADA Merchandise Marketing, made this offer: ''Eight trailer loads of food from one of the leading department store chains in the U.S.A. All food is in date and has been gone through to discard any unmarketable merchandise. This is super clean merchandise. Packed in banana boxes. All boxes are full. You will not find a better banana box deal!!!!!'',In this trade, Second Harvest sees competition for a scarce resource. Companies like Lipton, Campbell Soup and Quaker Oats find themselves in a tug of war with their retailers over control of this damaged merchandise. With brand names they have nurtured for decades, the manufacturers fear liability and loss of consumer loyalty if a flea market shopper becomes ill after eating one of their products on this largely unregulated market. For their part, the retailers say the goods are their property to dispose of as they wish.,So far, this emerging market has not significantly slowed the flow of donated damaged goods to charities, but staff members at several large food charities project that it will. Indeed, clearly threatened by this booming trade, Second Harvest this year said it would enter the salvage business itself, offering to provide a secure final resting spot for damaged goods, distributing usable items only through its charity network and destroying anything that cannot be used.,Reinventing the Deal,Factory Runs For the Hungry,Second Harvest and smaller food charities are trying a host of other strategies as they scurry to keep goods on charity shelves.,''Everyone knew the charities were going to be expected to do more now,'' Ms. DiChiara said. ''What I'm finding is that we're expected to do more with less.'',Increasingly, they are being forced to reinvent their relationship with food makers.,Until two years ago, Golden Grain, a pasta maker, donated thousands of pounds of noodles each month to the Greater Chicago Food Depository, the second largest food bank in the Second Harvest network. But donations fell after the company figured out how to grind up substandard pasta and feed it back through its machines, said the food bank's executive director, Michael P. Mulqueen.,Ultimately, the food bank and the pasta maker came up with a way to compensate for lost donations by running the factory at times of low market demand to create noodles just for the food bank, Mr. Mulqueen said. Pillsbury's Thomas Debrowski instituted a similar practice several years ago, and Minute Maid has begun making juice for Second Harvest. Some other companies, like Kraft, have shifted to cash donations.,Charities are also approaching farmers to scavenge leftover crops, conducting the Biblical ''second harvest'' for which the national group is named. The Clinton Administration last year announced plans for an ambitious campaign to glean some of the mountains of imperfect produce that now go to waste each year.,And last year, Second Harvest began distributing tons of Pacific Northwest fish that is caught in nets but cannot be sold because of Federal regulations controlling some fish stocks. The program, created with Northwest Food Strategies, a nonprofit group in Seattle, now sends frozen salmon, halibut and other fish around the country.,As always, canned-food drives by scouting groups and religious congregations are being employed, but they provide a fraction of the total flow, and the assortment of goods often does not contain the foods that are most needed -- stew or cereal and the like. At the Neighbor to Neighbor food pantry in Greenwich, Conn., there is a ''gourmet section,'' which recently contained goose liver pate, lemon curd and bamboo shoots.,Over all, experience has produced a discouraging sense at Second Harvest and other food banks that whenever they identify a new source of food, it seems to dry up.,''You peck away,'' said James Barone, who is in charge of procuring supplies for Food for Survival, the main New York city food bank. ''And it's a constant battle.'',For several years, trucks and crews from Food for Survival have toured the Hunt's Point produce market in the Bronx each morning after the supermarkets or other retailers have bought their supply for the day, seeking donations of overripe tomatoes or wilted lettuce or whatever else is left.,But the city's greengrocers appear to have noticed, and they often now wait until the end of the morning sales period, then offer cash, at a lower-than-usual price, for goods that might once have found their way into the charity system.,Limits on Charity,Bare Cupboards And Saying No,At the food pantry in the basement of St. Raymond's Roman Catholic Church in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, the impact of the irregular flow of goods is apparent as soon as you walk in the door.,There is the large sign on a bulletin board: ''Alert. This food pantry is experiencing shortages. We reserve the right to limit quantities, limit the number of visits, extend the time between visits at any time and without prior notice.'',And there are the plastic bags of canned goods, rice and cereal handed out to a steady stream of old people, young women and a few young men. These days, the volunteers making up the grocery bags have less to choose from, because of a backlog of orders at Food for Survival.,Even basics like bread and juice are lacking lately, said Priscilla DiNapoli, the program's paid coordinator. When the Kellogg's Corn Flakes run out, as they inevitably do, the workers hand out Department of Agriculture crisp rice cereal printed with a message encouraging users to extend their other meals with cereal.,The flow of food was not coming close to keeping pace with rising demand, as many as 1,500 clients a month, Ms. DiNapoli said. So last spring, instead of letting people return every two weeks, the agency began limiting them to one visit a month, she said. ''We just don't have the food.''",ANDREW C.

"Twenty-one international monitors in Kosovo were detained overnight and most of the day by Serbian forces at the border with Macedonia, while other monitors were blocked from entering a village where Serbian troops were massing, an American diplomat supervising the monitors in Serbia said.,The monitors, from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, were detained by Serbian customs officers demanding to search their vehicles.,''It is a serious matter, holding on to our people for over 20 hours, some of whom sat in the car all night,'' William Walker, the American in charge of the monitors, said in an interview here today.,The monitors, from the Kosovo Verification Mission, refused the inspections because they have diplomatic status.,The customs officials then took the monitors' documents, preventing them from returning to Macedonia, where they are based. More monitors arrived to try to sort out the situation, and their documents were also taken away until 21 staff members were detained.,Belgrade appeared to ignore repeated requests by the European organization to allow the unarmed monitors to go. Finally the customs officials, who were armed, said they would use force to conduct the inspection and searched three of the eight cars.,The ordeal was over by late afternoon today, with no real explanation from Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It was a clear violation of the Vienna convention on diplomatic immunity, said Mr. Walker, who characterized it as typical of the Serbian authorities' lack of cooperation.,''This is an inconsistent message they are sending,'' Mr. Walker said. ''They say they are cooperating fully but at the same time they are harassing our people and using bureaucratic gimmicks. If they want to violate the Vienna convention, they will not win any friends in the international community.'',The incident comes at the same time as a heavy buildup of Serbian troops in the border area and raises doubts about Serbian promises to allow the 1,300 monitors to leave the country if NATO air strikes become imminent.,Monitors also were blocked from entering the village, Bukos, which has been surrounded by Yugoslav Army tanks and troop trucks and is being shelled by soldiers. Dozens of soldiers fanned out across the mountain ridges to flush out remaining ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters.,The Serbian troops refused requests to move the tree they had used to block the road.,The offensive, described by the army as a ''winter training exercise,'' has clearly developed into a major sweep by the army through a region of hills and villages parallel to the main railway line and road in northern Kosovo.",CARLOTTA GALL,"FEB. 27, 1999",Armed Serbs Detain 21 Monitors in Kosovo,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/armed-serbs-detain-21-monitors-in-kosovo.html
"Gen. Andre Devigny, a legendary figure in the French Resistance for his escape from the Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie's prison in German-occupied Lyons during World War II, has died at his home in Hauteville-sur-Fier, France. General Devigny, whose dash to freedom inspired the French director Robert Bresson's award-winning film ''A Man Escaped,'' was 82.,His family announced his death on Feb. 18, saying he was buried on Feb. 15.,On Aug. 20, 1943, General Devigny, then a French Army lieutenant, was taken before Mr. Barbie, who had been holding him prisoner for four months. Mr. Barbie told the prisoner he would be shot within days as a Resistance assassin.,Instead, Lieutenant Devigny escaped within days, in what apparently was the only breakout from the Gestapo's notorious Fort Montluc prison, which held 10,000 Jews and Resistance fighters during the war.,Thirteen years later, Mr. Bresson, who had once been held by the Germans as a prisoner of war, drew on General Devigny's memoirs to make  ''A Man Escaped.'' Using amateur actors and sparse dialogue but memorable sound effects to heighten the tension -- the rattling of jailers' keys, the slamming of cell doors -- it won Mr. Bresson selection as best director at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival.,General Devigny was an adviser for the film, which was shot in part inside the prison cell where he had been held. In 1983 Mr. Barbie was put into the same prison after being returned to France from Bolivia. He was convicted of crimes against humanity four years later and was sentenced to life imprisonment, and died in 1991.,In May 1940, Lieutenant Devigny was commanding French troops fighting the Germans in Belgium. While behind enemy lines, he was mistakenly shot by French soldiers. Wounded in the legs and buttocks, he was taken to a military hospital in Bordeaux, then sent to recuperate at his home in the Savoie region, where he had grown up as one of seven children in a farm family.,Two years later, Lieutenant Devigny was recruited by an intelligence network of former French officers run from Geneva by Col. Georges Groussard, the former commander of the French military academy Saint-Cyr and a follower of de Gaulle.,On April 14, 1943, Lieutenant Devigny and a fellow Resistance man shot and killed an Italian counterespionage agent who was working for the Germans in Nice. But another German agent had infiltrated their unit. Three days later, Lieutenant Devigny was arrested by the Gestapo.,He was tortured over two weeks and kept handcuffed in his 10-foot-square cell at the supposedly escape-proof Fort Montluc. But he was undeterred. He had learned to remove his handcuffs with a safety pin. Using a soup spoon he had ground down to a point on the cell's concrete floor, he found that he could remove the vertical wooden slats at the bottom of his cell and squeeze through the opening.,At night, when the guards were not  making their rounds, he would leave the cell and wander the halls, chatting with the other prisoners. Waiting for the right moment to attempt an escape, he fashioned a rope from his blanket and mattress cover and created a grappling hook from the frame of an old lantern he had found in the hallway.,On Aug. 24, 1943, he and another prisoner recently placed with him removed the cell's wooden slats, climbed through a skylight and made their way into a courtyard. Lieutenant Devigny threw a sentry to the ground, then stabbed him with his bayonet.,At 3 A.M., after a guard bicycling around the perimeter roadway had passed, he tied one end of his rope to the infirmary chimney and threw the attached grappling hook over the top of an outer wall. The two prisoners then swung themselves over a 15-foot gap and leapt to freedom.,Lieutenant Devigny eluded German search parties and dogs by hiding in mud flats along the Rhone and fled to Switzerland with the help of the Resistance.,He eventually joined a French commando unit in North Africa and took part in the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944.,At war's end, de Gaulle presented him with the Cross of the Liberation, a coveted decoration. De Gaulle later appointed him a senior official in  France's foreign-intelligence organization.,General Devigny retired from military service in 1971. He is survived by his wife, a son and three daughters.,He had considered entering politics. But he said in an interview with Reuters in 1997 that he rejected the idea ''when I realized the backstabbing was far worse than anything I'd ever encountered in secret warfare.''",RICHARD GOLDSTEIN,"FEB. 27, 1999","Andre Devigny, 82; Escaped Gestapo Prison",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/world/andre-devigny-82-escaped-gestapo-prison.html
"It began perhaps with ''Megan's Law,'' which taught legislators a lesson: one way to galvanize support for a bill, to distinguish it from the tide of others that flow every year through capitals across the land, is to name it after a victim. Instead of a title or provision that reads like unfathomable legal patois, there is an easily identifiable person whose plight is often the bill's catalyst.,In Albany last year, that law begat ''Jenna's Law'' and ''Jeremy's Law.'' Now under consideration are bills named after two women: Kendra Webdale, who was pushed to her death under a subway train, and Judy Packevicz, who died after a dispute with her H.M.O. over approving a liver transplant. And then there is ''Buster's Law,'' which pays homage to an abused cat.,While such labeling may seem frivolous, it can play an important role in battles in the Legislature. Last year, Gov. George E. Pataki and Republican allies repeatedly used the death of Jenna Grieshaber, 22, a nursing student who was killed by a parolee, as a potent symbol of the need to limit parole for first-time violent felons. The Democratic majority in the Assembly relented.,This year, the Democrats are seeking to turn the tables with ''Judy's Law,'' also known by its more pedestrian title, New York State Bill A1400. The measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, would give patients more rights to sue H.M.O.'s in disputes over coverage. The Assembly overwhelmingly approved it  this month, but it faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled State Senate.,Soon after Ms. Webdale's death, the new Attorney General, Eliot L. Spitzer, began writing legislation that would allow courts to order mentally ill people to take their medication. Ms. Webdale was pushed by a man with schizophrenia who went off his medication, the authorities say. Assemblywoman Elizabeth A. Connelly, a Staten Island Democrat, is sponsoring a similar measure.,''It not only helps politically because it focuses legislators' attention by personalizing the issue,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''but it also is a way of honoring a victim, and hopefully having something useful come out of what was a very personal tragedy for that family.'',''Buster's Law,'' sponsored by Assemblyman James Tedisco, a Schenectady Republican, would stiffen penalties for mistreating animals. Its genesis was the case of an 18-month-old tabby that was set on fire by a teen-ager. The cat died six weeks later.,A Candidate's Controversy,Mr. Pataki has been searching for a new health commissioner for several months, and he and his aides have interviewed a few candidates. One has drawn most of the scrutiny, and the reason sheds light on Mr. Pataki's sometimes uneasy relations with abortion rights groups.,The candidate is the former United States Surgeon General, Dr. Antonia Novello, who served in the Bush Administration. It is not clear whether Dr. Novello would accept the job if offered, nor whether Mr. Pataki wants to give it to her.,But some vocal abortion rights groups are protesting the possibility, saying that she opposes abortion and thus is not appropriate in a state where abortion rights are generally favored. They say that over his political career, Mr. Pataki has wavered in his support for abortion rights, and if he appoints Dr. Novello, he will be spurning their cause.,The Governor's aides declined to comment on candidates, but they emphasized that it is Mr. Pataki, not his health commissioner, who controls the administration's health policy, and that his views on abortion have not changed. He supports abortion rights, though he has said he would sign legislation that would ban the procedure that abortion opponents call ''partial birth abortion.'',Dr. Novello has not returned calls seeking comment. Among the other candidates Mr. Pataki is said to be considering are Dr. John Lumpkin, who is director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, and Dr. Russell Bessette, chairman of the State Public Health Council. They have not been identified by abortion rights groups as opponents of abortion.,Portrait of a Judge,In 1992, the state's Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, was arrested and later went to prison for harassing a woman with whom he was having an affair. It was an episode that jarred the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, and even now, the impact is evident. Mr. Wachtler is one of the few past judges in the court's history whose portrait does not adorn the walls of its chambers in Albany.,The seven-member court has long had a tradition of asking members who retire from its bench to sit for a painting.,It is not that Mr. Wachtler's portrait has been banned because of the shame he brought to the institution, said Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the court. Mr. Browne said Mr. Wachtler's successor, Judith S. Kaye, would like his portrait on the wall, but he had not agreed to be painted. And while Judge Kaye is hopeful that he will, she does not know when that will happen, Mr. Browne said.,Mr. Wachtler could not be reached for comment yesterday. He has taught in recent years at the law center at Touro College, and did not respond to two messages left there.,Meanwhile, in what Mr. Browne described as a coincidence, the court has been busy in recent years procuring the portraits of past judges who for unexplained reasons were not represented in the chambers. Among the newest additions: Charles Gray, who left the court in 1848, and Charles Ruggles, who heard his last arguments in 1853.",CLIFFORD J.

"''It's very sad for me to say tonight that after 100 singles and many albums, this man hasn't received any royalties off his music,'' said Judy Adams, the widow of the New Orleans singer Johnny Adams. Mrs. Adams spoke after her husband was honored at the Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation's 10th Annual Pioneer Awards on Thursday night at Sony Studios here.,If the Grammy Awards is a time for the music business to celebrate itself, then the Pioneer Awards, traditionally held the night after the Grammys, is a time for the industry to make reparations. In addition to keeping alive the memory of groundbreaking, chart-topping and often forgotten rhythm-and-blues musicians, the foundation was formed to help musicians and their families get royalties for their hits, erase longstanding debts to record labels and pay for everything from health insurance to funeral expenses. In 10 years, the foundation has given out over $2.5 million to musicians.,''The slavery was dressed up in a suit,'' Ms. Adams said of the record executives she said had exploited her husband with ''shake-hand deal slavery'' as the audience of 1,200 people (including many music executives) rose for a standing ovation.,Complaints and injustice, however, were just subplots in a ceremony that perhaps more than any other awards show was about revering and reveling in music. It had a warmth and immediacy lacking in the many other dinners, fund-raisers and awards shows surrounding the Grammys, perhaps because it was the only one that was not motivated by or dedicated to ego.,Some of those being honored had lost their master tapes, their publishing, their royalties, their concert revenue, their instruments, their families, their good will and even their band names because of bad business deals. But they still had their songs, if not on record or paper, at least in their hearts.,Honorees, presenters and the night's very funny host, Smokey Robinson, all found some way to sing, even if it wasn't a planned part of the show. ''I wish they'd let me sing, because that's what I do,'' said Charlie Thomas before he and Bill Pinkney, both recipients of Pioneer Awards for their work with the Drifters, bent over the podium microphone and sang an impromptu ''Under the Boardwalk'' with accompaniment from the quick-vamping house band (led by Maceo Parker) and the audience.,Many of the previous night's Grammy winners, including Lauryn Hill, Eric Clapton and Cissy Houston, joined those being honored on the stage. Recipients of the Pioneer Award, which comes with not just a statuette but also a check for $15,000 to $25,000, also included Brenda Holloway, Garnet Mimms, Barbara Lynn, Dee Dee Warwick, the Manhattans, Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles, Barbara Lewis, Mickey Baker, Joe Simon and the songwriting teams of David Porter and Isaac Hayes and Ashford and Simpson.,For many of them it was their first time being honored or even being paid respect by the music establishment, a moment in the sun after decades of darkness. ''You have made tonight the highlight of my career,'' the singer Barbara Lewis said tearfully after a cajoling, open-throated performance of ''Hello Stranger.'' ''I will remember and cherish tonight for the rest of my life.'',Though the careers of some of the award winners were resuscitated in recent decades, the honored artists were envoys from a pre-MTV age, when music fans knew the songs but not necessarily the faces. Even when the performers were rusty -- bumping into the microphone stand or struggling through guitar fingerings -- they displayed a depth of spirit that unlike much of modern pop (the very name of which implies a brief explosion) never dies. Neither, it seems, do old rivalries. In their first time together in 31 years, Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles began bickering onstage.,After apologizing repeatedly for her voice being down, Ms. LaBelle wailed and sustained stunningly from the very first note of ''You'll Never Walk Alone.'' She said afterward that this week she had turned down an invitation to the White House and had not bothered to show up to receive her Grammy Award, for traditional rhythm-and-blues vocalist, on Wednesday but the Pioneer Award was not an honor she was going to miss. It was presented to her by this year's Grammy darling, Lauryn Hill, who gushed, ''You are solely responsible for everything I do and everything I am.'',After Mr. Hayes and Sam Moore brought the audience to its feet during ''Soul Man'' and Ms. Holloway practically unhinged her jaws to belt her Motown hit ''Every Little Bit Hurts'' the musical highlight was the night's closing jam, with John Lee Hooker. (Mr. Hooker, 82, was not just a recipient of a lifetime achievement award but also a philanthropist who donated his $25,000 award to the foundation.) He picked, growled and stomped around the stage, coaxing solos out of his accompanists, who included Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Larry Graham, Keb Mo, Hubert Sumlin and 84-year-old Robert Lockwood Jr.,Emotional highlights included Ms.  Warwick's being presented with an award by her more successful sister, Dionne, who modestly thanked the foundation for recognizing ''the real singer in our family.'' Accepting her award, Dee Dee Warwick pledged, ''I promise I'll see better days.'',Mr. Baker, 74, who played guitar on countless hits from Joe Turner's ''Shake Rattle and Roll'' to the Shirelles' ''Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?,'' criticized himself for ''all the guitar solos that I threw away for nothing,'' elaborating that he had been paid only $10 to $70 for much of his work. Then he left the stage, concluding without a trace of bitterness in his voice, ''I'll just go away and die quietly.'' The audience members gasped: quietness was the last thing they wanted from any of these performers.",NEIL STRAUSS,"FEB. 27, 1999","Accepting Kudos and Cash, A Song in Their Hearts",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/arts/accepting-kudos-and-cash-a-song-in-their-hearts.html
"Cyrus Atefi, as I shall call him, was brought to this country from Iran in 1978, when he was a few months old. His father had been a bureaucrat in the Shah's intelligence agency, Savak, so the family fled after the Islamic revolution. The parents, two older children and Cyrus were given political asylum in the United States.,Three years later Cyrus's parents were divorced. His mother worked two jobs to support the children. As a teen-ager, Cyrus went downhill, cutting school, eventually dropping out, using methamphetamines.,In 1997 Cyrus was charged with possession of methamphetamines for sale. (He had bought some for himself and four friends.) He got the lowest possible sentence, a year on work furlough, and was released for good behavior after six months. He straightened out, went off drugs, worked full time and planned to head for dental school.,Last fall agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service went to Cyrus's place of work and took him away. The reason was that a 1996 law, the Illegal Immigration Act, defined his drug offense as an ''aggravated felony'' despite the low sentence, and made him deportable. Under the act his detention is also mandatory. He is being held for deportation to Iran.,If Cyrus is deported to Iran, he is likely to be arrested and tortured. His uncle, who stayed in Iran, was tortured and executed by the Islamic regime.,The case of Cyrus Atefi came to mind when I read about efforts being made by Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, to help another person targeted under the 1996 law. He is Robert A. Broley, whose father is treasurer of the Orange County, Florida, Republican executive committee.,Mr. Broley, who is 32 years old, is a former drug addict who served four years in a Florida prison on 13 felony charges of theft and fraud. When he got out of prison, last December, he was deported to his native Canada.,Representative McCollum has introduced a private bill that would relieve Mr. Broley of the 1996 act's consequences and allow him back into the United States. It had nothing to do with the political connection, the Congressman said; he hardly knew Mr. Broley's father.,Mr. McCollum strongly supported the Draconian 1996 immigration legislation. And he seemed icily unforgiving as one of the Republican impeachment managers in the Senate trial of President Clinton. So some in Florida have seen his sponsorship of a private relief bill for Mr. Broley as hypocritical.,But it could be something else. Congressman McCollum may be moved by the human consequences of the 1996 law now that he sees them. It is easy to be for harsh measures in the abstract. It is not so easy when you see the result in shattered lives.,''I don't believe,'' Mr. McCollum told The Orlando Sentinel, ''that somebody like Broley should be treated differently than anyone else simply because his parents are involved in local politics. I think his case should be judged on the merits.'',Exactly. But judgment on the merits -- mercy on the merits -- is needed not only for Robert Broley. Thousands of people have been deported or are awaiting deportation because of criminal offenses much less serious than his.,Deborah Aaron, who came to this country from Britain, has been married to an American for 22 years. She now faces deportation, and separation from her family, because at the age of 20, in London, she was fined 10 pounds (about $16) for a minor drug violation. She has tried to get members of Congress to introduce a private bill for her. They responded with sympathy but said they could not do so when drugs were involved.,Or think about Cyrus Atefi. He was younger than Robert Broley -- an infant -- when he came here. His crime was much less serious. And the I.N.S. wants to deport him not to Canada but to Iran.,What is needed is a regular procedure, in law, to waive deportation of deserving individuals when it would cause extreme hardship. That used to exist. The 1996 act seemed to have struck it out. But the Supreme Court has just indicated that the agency can call off a deportation ''for humanitarian reasons.'' One way or another, there must an escape valve. Without it, we have a system of random cruelty.",ANTHONY LEWIS,"FEB. 27, 1999",Abroad at Home; The Quality Of Mercy,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/opinion/abroad-at-home-the-quality-of-mercy.html
"DAHLMA LLANOS has a story to tell. Many people do, but work and family sap enough energy that the only phrase they commit to paper are two words that languish at the bottom of a to-do list: Write Book. Ms. Llanos has passed that first hurdle. She is writing a memoir during her weekends and summer vacations. Other obstacles persist.,''There's always the question if you're ready,'' she said. ''What makes my life so different? I'm a black, Puerto Rican, educated woman. That's something that doesn't seem to exist in American letters. I couldn't find anybody like myself writing when I was growing up.'',Ms. Llanos knows she has a book or two in her. She certainly has thousands around her, since she works as a high school librarian in the Bronx. Surrounded by all those volumes, she probably feels some sort of pull to coax her words out of her mind and on to the shelf.,That is the only pull that keeps her going, since she has no pull with publishers. It can be discouraging, especially when Ms. Llanos sees the $600,000 book advance given to Monica Lewinsky for telling her story to Andrew Morton, her authorized biographer. And don't forget the obligatory sit-down with Barbara Walters, television's official hagiographer for martyred celebrities. Some people call this news. Ms. Llanos would prefer to call it a day, at least when it comes to the supernova of hype on all things Monica.,''What else can she say?'' Ms. Llanos wondered. ''Her story is out there already. It's done.'',Sex and scandal sell, but they come at a price -- and not the one on the dust jacket. While the focus is on O. J. or Monica, there are countless American lives being ignored. Some stories are beautiful, others boring. But how many will go untold, even while Ms. Llanos's students search for books written by people who look and live like them?,''There are a lot of people struggling out here who think they have something to say,'' Ms. Llanos said. ''But there's no notoriety. Just people living quiet lives who grow up and pursue their story but don't have a publisher's ear. I don't begrudge Monica her success. I just think there is room for other voices.'',Ms. Llanos found a little room for herself at the Bronx Writers' Center, a quiet space with computers and books in the basement of the Westchester Square branch of the New York Public Library. She is enrolled in Write On Sistas, a workshop that teaches women writers how to apply for grants or to sell their manuscripts to journals and publishers.,ANGIE CRUZ, a graduate student in fiction-writing at New York University, leads the workshop, which is sort of a support group where emerging writers learn from each other and from published authors. Ms. Cruz, 27, is working on her first novel, a story about the lives and struggles of six Dominican women in Washington Heights.,''I was looking for my story, and that's when I started thinking about the different stories told in my home,'' she said. ''I wanted to write them for myself. Or, at least, so I wouldn't forget. Now I'm excited about writing something that someone reads and relates to.'',She has been too busy studying and writing to care about Monica's book. About the only thing that she remembers about it is the advance. She would rather see that kind of money go to support literacy efforts and turn people into critical readers. Then perhaps they would begin to question their media diet. ''Why are they trying to sell us this now?'' Ms. Cruz said. ''I'm like, whatever about Monica Lewinsky. Give me the money to do something that will help change the world.'',The only thing that Monica's book might change is her legal bills. The writers who are in Ms. Cruz's workshop have bills, too. Their only option is to work at jobs that can wipe them out by the time they get home to face a blank screen. Ms. Llanos, 49, relishes those elusive moments when she can work on her memoir or revise part of a novel.,''When I entered college I said I wanted to be a writer, and my mother said, 'Si, si. But how are you going to pay the bills?' '' she said. ''The whole business of being working class cuts across color lines. If you're a woman what can you do?'',Keep on working and writing, confident that you have something to say.,''I have to wait until I retire to do what I wanted since I was a teen-ager,'' she said. ''At first I was bitter. But then I realized, I'll have so much more to write about.''",DAVID GONZALEZ,"FEB. 27, 1999",About New York; Lone Voice Drowned Out By Media Din,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/nyregion/about-new-york-lone-voice-drowned-out-by-media-din.html

But during a routine review today of the sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992 to encourage the suspects' extradition, most members appeared to agree with Mr. Annan.,The Secretary General reported that he had sent a letter to the Libyan Government saying that Libya had already been granted all the ''explanations and clarifications'' it had requested.,The United States and Britain said they would soon ask the Council to commit itself to the 30-day deadline.,Libya's representative, Abuzed Omar Dorda, gave no indication how his Government would respond, saying only that Libya would study Mr. Annan's letter ''from a legal and a political point of view.'',Libya will seek assurances that all sanctions will be lifted immediately if it complies, he said.",PAUL LEWIS,"FEB. 27, 1999",A Warning At the U.N.

Contributions of all sizes poured into the fund, from incidental change to the largest single gift in the fund's history. Every cent is worth celebrating, and so is every contributor.,Each year The Times runs a series of articles inspired by the Neediest Cases Fund drive that are meant to put a human face on the drive, and to suggest some of the ways the seven charities it finances go about their work.

Tempting as it is to sum up the success of this year's fund drive in dollars, the real success is the way these charities translate money into relief, with unswerving commitment, startling ingenuity and the labor of many hands.,The end of the drive is not the end of the occasion for giving.

"With an energetic stride, Stephen DiBrienza, a City Councilman from Brooklyn, dashed from one news conference to another on a chilly morning the other day, offering impassioned musings on subjects ranging from the need for greater public access to City Hall's steps to the rights of citizens to use public space for community gardens.,Passion is the characteristic most often attributed to Mr. DiBrienza, a 44-year-old lawyer who has been a member of the Council for more than a dozen years. It is that trait, many of his colleagues say, that placed him at the center of a bitter confrontation with the Giuliani administration, a confrontation from which he emerged with something that has eluded many of his fellow Democrats: a victory over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. It was so significant a feat, in fact, that it has given an unplanned push to Mr. DiBrienza's hope of being elected the city's Public Advocate in 2001.,Mr. DiBrienza was the chief sponsor of a bill, passed by the Council, that changed procedures at the city's emergency assistance unit for homeless families and several other aspects of the city's policies on the homeless. Mr. Giuliani initially fought the legislation, saying it was intrusive and unrealistic, but the Council passed it over his veto.,The Mayor retaliated by threatening to evict five community programs from a building in Mr. DiBrienza's district, saying he would replace the programs with a homeless shelter. But the administration's plans drew outrage, and in a striking reversal, the Giuliani administration said last week that it would not evict the community programs.,Mr. DiBrienza said that the dispute with the Mayor was guided by reason, not politics.,''It's much more than a personal victory,'' Mr. DiBrienza said in an interview. ''It's a big victory for homeless advocates and for people who care how they treat the less fortunate. To me, the issue was fighting the administration's effort to disrupt the lives of wonderful, innocent people -- the mentally ill, the senior and the elderly.'',Still, there are decidedly political overtones, Mr. DiBrienza recognizes. At times, he sounds very much as if he has already started out on the campaign trail.,''I want to be the Public Advocate for this city,'' he said ''I think that in many ways, I have already been a public advocate. For me, it's the next logical step. It's the place that I think I can be most effective. I can look at why things work in government and why things don't. And I have a history of producing legislation that works.'',He added that ''the publicity has been terrific,'' but that ''for me, it was the whole package of helping the community that was important.'',How that distant race turns out for Mr. DiBrienza is, of course, anyone's guess. Although he was elected to the Council during Edward I. Koch's second term in Gracie Mansion, Mr. DiBrienza is not particularly well known outside of the neighborhoods he represents and within City Hall circles.,Furthermore, he does not enjoy a particularly warm relationship with the Brooklyn Democratic Party organization, a relationship that could be helpful to a candidate in a potentially crowded race for a post whose occupant is second in the line of mayoral succession. Some within the organization suggest that he operates too independently and that he often works stridently with others.,And there are other, older officials in the borough who recall his entry into politics in the early 1980's, when he ran, unsuccessfully, against Thomas J. Cuite, a native son of Brooklyn who at the time was the majority leader of the City Council.,Mr. DiBrienza grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and went into politics after completing law school. He said he was inspired to run for office after being heavily involved in neighborhood revitalization organizations.,''I felt that government was not listening to citizens and to communities,'' he said.,In 1985, Mr. DiBrienza was elected to the Council, where he represents a swath of Brooklyn neighborhoods from Carroll Gardens through parts of Park Slope and Sunset Park to Bay Ridge.,At City Hall, Mr. DiBrienza is best known because of his role as chairman of the Council's Committee on General Welfare, which looks at issues affecting homelessness, welfare and the city's services to children and people with AIDS.,He is also known for his booming voice, his aggressive questions during City Council hearings and fierce speeches in the Council chamber that can border on the hysterical. Occasionally, Mr. DiBrienza's questioning has been so confrontational that a witness before his committee -- Nicholas Scoppetta, for example, who runs the Administration for Children's Services -- has simply walked out of the hearing room.,But to many of his colleagues, Mr. DiBrienza is seen as a diligent champion.,''Steve is regarded by most of his colleagues as one of the hardest-working and most serious members of the Council,'' said Kenneth K. Fisher, a Councilman from a neighboring district in Brooklyn. ''He is passionate about issues. So he is somebody that people pay attention to, because he deserves it. And because he demands it.''",JONATHAN P.

"The New York Stock Exchange said yesterday that it was seriously pursuing a strategy that would allow it to trade the stocks of its archrival, the Nasdaq stock market, where some of the nation's major technology issues are traded.,After years of trying to lure Nasdaq's pre-eminent companies, such as the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, to the floor of the Big Board, officials at the world's largest stock exchange said that they might become a partner with an electronic trading operation that deals in Nasdaq stocks, or create their own electronic system that would operate side by side with floor traders to offer Nasdaq stocks.,The actions are a tacit acknowledgment on the part of Big Board officials that they need to make a sharper move into the growing field of electronic trading, and that they would desperately like to grab a larger share of the market in high-technology stocks.,The announcement is also another indication that smaller investors, who are trading on line and at significantly reduced prices, are forcing Wall Street to offer a greater variety of products with fast, electronic and streamlined operations.,Reports of the Big Board's intentions were first reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal.,''This recognizes that the world we serve is changing dramatically,'' Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, said in an interview yesterday.,In response, the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq stock market, said that it welcomed the competition. Some listed stocks are already traded on the Nasdaq system.,''We are up to the challenge,'' Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the N.A.S.D., said in a statement. ''In fact, this demonstrates what we have been saying, that Nasdaq's open-access, pro-competition market model is the superior place for large successful companies.'',To retain its supremacy in a rapidly changing market, the Big Board, which lists many of the world's largest companies, such as General Electric and I.B.M., and is a much larger marketplace than the Nasdaq, has plans to extend its trading hours beyond the regular 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. day and offer a greater range of products, particularly technology stocks.,Mr. Grasso said that these moves were part of a strategy that had been formulated over the last year, a strategy that includes a much stronger interest in electronic trading.,Mr. Grasso also said that the exchange had been in talks with several electronic communication networks, which are automated systems that match, buy and sell orders, and he did not rule out the possibility of an alliance with the Nasdaq.,But industry officials believe that a Nasdaq-Big Board alliance is unlikely, largely because of regulatory and antitrust considerations. Nasdaq officials say they are not currently in talks with the New York Stock Exchange about a merger, but would be interested in consolidating regulatory and less significant units.,Still, Mr. Grasso said that the Big Board was moving boldly to bring customers a wider selection of products, and talked often of branding products under the exchange name, perhaps even its own electronic system.,''We might decide to create our own brand, like AT&T created Lucky Dog,'' Mr. Grasso said, referring to AT&T's Lucky Dog campaign, which supports a new calling service, 10-10-345.,But Mr. Grasso insisted that all the plans would include floor traders, indicating that the Big Board had no intention of doing away with its floor-based auction trading in favor of a purely electronic format.,He said the new model would simply offer either electronic or floor trading in Nasdaq stocks: ''I would call it a new and creative way to trade those securities,'' he said.,As things now stand, most of the world's largest companies pay a price to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But the younger Nasdaq stock market offers trading in some of the best-known technology stocks, such as Amazon.com and Dell Computer.,The Big Board has a floor trading system, while the Nasdaq is largely electronic, with dealers entering and matching orders by computer. Both markets have seen explosive volume growth in recent years, but technology issues have been the fastest growing and the most volatile.,Richard Ketchum, chief operating officer at the N.A.S.D., said that the Big Board's announcement simply acknowledged that Nasdaq had great technology offerings. But he said the Big Board would have to explain to listed companies why the exchange was trading the stocks of unlisted companies that had not paid a high fee to list.,Nasdaq officials also used the opportunity to call for the Big Board to repeal its Rule 500, which makes it difficult for listed companies to joining the Nasdaq.,Both the Nasdaq and the Big Board, however, may be battling to create markets with heftier offerings and greater volume at lower costs at a time when at least one Electronic Communications Network is considering filing for status as a stock exchange that is largely electronic, and thereby very inexpensive.,What the New York Stock Exchange is trying to do, however, is find a strategy that allows it to trade more products at a lower cost, said Robert Forney, chairman of the Chicago Stock Exchange, which trades both Nasdaq and Big Board stocks.,''Why trade just New York stocks, why not trade Nasdaq to get the economies of scale,'' Mr. Forney said. ''Most people don't care if it's listed in New York or on the Nasdaq.''",DAVID BARBOZA,"FEB. 27, 1999",A Big Board Move to Trade Nasdaq Stocks,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/business/a-big-board-move-to-trade-nasdaq-stocks.html
"Horse meat brokers may want them for dog food and European dinner plates.,The Amish may want them for their buggies and carts.,And now, animal welfare groups are scrambling for money to outbid everyone when 27 abandoned horses go up for auction at a foreclosed farm in New Jersey this afternoon.,Though the days of fast-talking horse traders might seem like a thing of the dusty past to city dwellers, raucous livestock auctions have always been a part of life in the grassy dales of Salem County in the southwestern part of the state.,But what is new to the world of horse auctions, most horse traders  say, is the intervention of the animal welfare groups.,The plight of the horses came to light on Feb. 5, when officials of the United States Trotting Association, the equine equivalent of the American Kennel Club, received an E-mail message saying an Alloway Township farmer had been evicted from his land but had left his 27 standardbreds behind, said Ellen Harvey, a spokeswoman for the organization, based in Columbus, Ohio.,So working with the Standardbred Retirement Foundation, which finds adoptive homes for aging and injured racehorses, Ms. Harvey's group persuaded the county, which had taken responsibility for the horses, to sell them locally rather than ship them to a wholesale auction house in Pennsylvania. There, she said, the horses would almost certainly have been bought for meat; that prospect is less likely at a small, farm-based auction.,But the victory may still not keep the meat brokers away from the standardbreds.,''Word about the auction has apparently gone out through the killer-buyer community,'' said Ms. Harvey, using the term that animal welfare advocates reserve for the brokers. ''And we're very concerned that they're coming by to see if they can buy these horses cheap.'',To prevent that, the two equine groups have established a fund to save the standardbreds and plan to take their donations to the auction. Ms. Harvey said she did not know how much was in the fund. The horses are expected to fetch as much as $1,000 each, Ms. Harvey said.,Meat brokers typically pay between $600 and $800 for a horse, said Judith Bokman, executive director of the Standardbred Retirement Foundation of Freehold, N.J. If the advocates can boost the bid past 79 cents per pound, the going wholesale price for horse meat, they might be able to scare the brokers off, she said.,The auction, at Jo-Vin Farm, is expected to attract several hundred bidders. Others in the horse business said they expect several Amish from nearby Lancaster County, Pa., to travel east to make their bids.,''The Amish will definitely come over -- they're always in the market for fresh horses,'' said Kurt Lang, a horse trainer at the Brookledge Horse Transportation Company in Oley, Pa. ''They'll pick up some standardbreds as road horses, make 'em pull a plow or buggy for the rest of their lives.'',Workers at New Holland Sales Stables, a horse-trading post in Lancaster County, said they were unsure whether the Amish would attend the auction. They added that most Amish did not have telephones and could not be reached for comment.,The auction is being held to pay off a $62,000 debt that is owed to a Hackensack, N.J., mortgage company, the Kennedy Fund Inc., which foreclosed on the property in 1996. The farm's former owner, Dick Brooks, was evicted in January.,Mr. Brooks could not be reached for comment yesterday, and his attorney, Paul Van Embden, declined to comment on the case.,But Matthew Cole, vice president of the Kennedy Fund, said the sight of the horses, which were left in the paddocks with no more than a day's supply of oats, touched a nerve. The company has been paying people to tend and feed the horses, which remain on the farm.,''We're just not used to this,'' he said. ''We make loans for people as big as Bob Guccione. We don't sell livestock. But what are you supposed to do? Leave a bunch of horses there with nothing to eat?'',Horse meat brokers are a notoriously secretive lot, Ms. Bokman said. A handful of people she described as traffickers in the meat refused to discuss the auction yesterday.,One horse dealer, Frank Carper, owner of Camelot Stables in Cranbury, N.J., said he never bought horses expressly to sell them as meat but added that some horses he traded did indeed wind up in the slaughterhouse.,''Still, there won't be anyone down at this auction buying horses for meat,'' he said. ''Most will be bought up as saddle horses. The meat trade's dead. It's ancient history.'',But according to Nat Messer, associate professor of equine medicine at the University of Missouri in Columbia, about 100,000 horses are slaughtered for food every year in the United States and Canada. Most of the meat is used in dog food or in the horse stews and steaks that 3 percent to 5 percent of Europeans eat daily, Dr. Messer said.",ALAN FEUER,"FEB. 27, 1999",A Bid to Save 27 Abandoned Horses From Slaughter,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/nyregion/a-bid-to-save-27-abandoned-horses-from-slaughter.html

"A two-year investigation of deaths at Pennsylvania's largest state institution for the mentally retarded led to the filing of charges today against six doctors, including two who were charged with involuntary manslaughter.,The two doctors, Cesar Miranda and Hyunchel Shin, were charged in the deaths of three patients from the Polk Center, a 101-year-old institution run by the state in this northwestern Pennsylvania town of 7,400.,Prosecutors from the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office said that Dr. Miranda, 68, had failed to examine a man with a blocked intestine for hours and that he had directed a woman to obtain an X-ray even though she was vomiting and feverish and her skin had turned blue.,The prosecutors said Dr. Shin, 74,  had failed to get a brain scan of a patient, leading to his death.,Charges of assault and neglect were filed against the four other doctors: Samir Moussa, 47, former medical director at the Polk Center; David Byers, 53; Donald Stitt, 84; and Louka Makkar, 50.,Among other things, the four doctors and Dr. Miranda are accused of using sutures and surgical staples to close wounds without giving the patients anesthesia.,Charles Lakin, who tracks cases of abuse nationwide from the Institute on Community Living at the University of Minnesota, had this to say about case: ''It gives you shivers. I've never heard of anything like that. If that's not the regular treatment for human beings, obviously someone's under the perception that these are not human beings.'',Lawyers for all six doctors said their clients were not guilty. Five were arraigned today and released on $50,000 bail. The sixth, Dr. Byers, is expected to surrender on Tuesday.,The Attorney General, Mike Fisher, whose office began investigating in 1997 after the deaths of the three patients, called it ''a very sad and disturbing case.'',''These doctors were entrusted with the care of some of our most dependent citizens,'' Mr. Fisher added. ''Many of these residents could not express pain or discomfort to the doctors. However, that's no excuse for circumventing normal medical procedures.'',One defendant, Dr. Makkar, said hospital and state officials were aware that doctors at Polk had commonly used surgical staples without anesthesia if an injury needed immediate treatment.,''You judge which pain is worse,'' he said.,Jay Pagni, a spokesman for the state welfare department, which operates the center, said there was no policy directing doctors to treat wounds without anesthesia. Mr. Pagni would not comment further on Dr. Makkar's assertion.,One manslaughter charge against Dr. Miranda stems from the death of Eugene Rozgonyi, 62, who was mentally retarded because of injuries he suffered from surgical instruments at birth.,Mr. Rozgonyi, who lived at Polk for 55 years, became sick on March 6, 1997, with a blocked intestine that made his belly expand. He got worse throughout the day, but Dr. Miranda did not examine him until midnight, when his body temperature had fallen to 16 degrees below normal, investigators said. Dr. Miranda is also accused of waiting too long, four hours, to transfer Mr. Rozgonyi to a hospital, where he died six hours after being admitted.,Mary Ellen Fritz, a spokeswoman for the welfare department, said it had remedied problems at Polk and drafted stricter rules for doctors after the accusations first arose, in 1996. Four doctors resigned and three were dismissed. One dismissed doctor was reinstated after arbitration. It is unclear whether that doctor is among the six charged.,The center employs about 1,200 people and has 565 residents, some of them so severely disabled they cannot communicate.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"FEB. 27, 1999",6 Doctors Charged in Abuse Of the Mentally Retarded,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/27/us/6-doctors-charged-in-abuse-of-the-mentally-retarded.html
"Asserting that an ''inflammatory atmosphere'' has influenced and intimidated grand jurors, lawyers for three of the four officers involved in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo have asked a Bronx judge to delay the inquest and move it to a secret location.,The request, filed yesterday morning, comes as demonstrations continue almost daily outside State Supreme Court in the Bronx, which is only a block from where the grand jury is impaneled in the Criminal Courthouse. Those rallies, and the news attention they garner, have prejudiced the jurors against their clients, the lawyers say.,''We waited to make this motion to see if the drumbeat would continue,'' said Stephen Worth, a police union lawyer representing Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four officers involved in the shooting. ''As it has continued unabated, we felt we had no alternative but to try to stop the process at this time.'',Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx District Attorney, Robert Johnson, said his office was preparing a response that would be filed  Monday with Acting Justice Robert G. Seewald of State Supreme Court, who impaneled the grand jury. Mr. Worth declined to specify what the motion would say. Mr. Worth's motion will be decided Tuesday.,Legal experts said that such motions were fairly unusual in criminal cases, even among those with heightened media attention. They also said the motion was unlikely to succeed, though it would begin to lay the groundwork for appeals if the four officers were later convicted. If indicted, the officers could face charges from second-degree murder to criminally negligent homicide.,Randolph Jonakait, a criminal-law professor at New York University Law School, said that he had never heard of such a motion involving a grand jury. Gerald Lynch, a criminal-law professor at Columbia Law School, added, ''A cynic would say the whole point was to build a record for later on.'',Mr. Lynch said that a defendant might have a credible claim if his lawyer could prove that ''a lynch mob was outside the door telling the grand jury that they're in trouble if they don't do the right thing'' but that it would have to be ''a very extreme situation'' for a judge to diverge from the normal system of justice.,Although the lawyers hired to represent Officer Richard Murphy and Officer Kenneth Boss have joined in Mr. Worth's filing, Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Officer Sean Carroll, has declined to become a party to it.,Saying that he expected the four officers to be indicted no matter how or where the grand jury was impaneled, Mr. Kornberg reasoned that if the judge granted Mr. Worth's motion, the defense lawyers in the case would have a hard time later arguing that the situation outside the courthouse had ''tainted the grand jury.'',He added, ''And I want to make sure that if there is an indictment, that I can later argue that it was tainted by pretrial publicity.'',Mr. Kornberg, the only lawyer hired independently of the police union, is also the only lawyer who has yet to work out a joint defense agreement with the others. Although he said he had not been asked, he had some reservations about joining the group because ''my first interest is to my client and I don't know what a joint defense agreement means to them.'',Such agreements usually allow lawyers to sit down together and discuss the case against their clients without having to fear that the conversations will later be subpoenaed by the prosecution. There is the possibility that any agreement among the four officers could break down. They were not regular partners who had spent years together on the street. And since they are the only known witnesses to the incident, they could differ over who saw what at the time of the killing, how many shots each fired and who fired first.,The plainclothes officers fired 41 times at Mr. Diallo, 22, an unarmed street peddler, as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment building in the Soundview section of the Bronx on the night of Feb. 4. Some of the officers, through their lawyers, have said they believed that Mr. Diallo was reaching for a weapon. He was hit by 19 bullets.,Yesterday, Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced that he had met with members of the United African Congress, a national group that represents African immigrants, to work out ways to improve relations between the Police Department and minority residents.",KIT R.

"After an unpredictable second round that saw more top-seeded players fall like dominoes, the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship has been whittled down to 16 players, and most of the pre-tournament favorites are gone.,Forget about a Tiger Woods vs. David Duval showdown. Duval, seeded No. 2, was beaten by Bill Glasson, 2 and 1. Duval never led and he was not sharp, missing a three-foot putt on No. 12, and an eight-foot putt for par on No. 17 to end the match.,After a hard-fought, 1-up victory over Bob Tway today, Woods was informed that he was the only top 10 seeded player remaining in the once prestigious field.,''Am I really?'' asked Woods. ''Wow.'',Before the tournament, Duval predicted some surprises, and his early departure became one of them.,''I didn't play well, and you get what you deserve when you don't play well,'' said Duval, who plans to take the next three weeks off. ''Everybody knows I'm not the biggest proponent of this format, but beyond that, I don't want to say anything, because it makes it sound like I'm crying, and I'm not. I got beat.'',Join the club. Vijay Singh, seeded No. 8, lost to Bernhard Langer, 2 and 1. Nick Price, seeded No. 9, was eliminated by Jeff Maggert, 1 up, when Price bogeyed the final hole, missing a five-foot putt for par. And Justin Leonard, seeded No. 10, lost to Shigeki Maruyama of Japan, 4 and 2. Maruyama, who had a perfect 5-0 record at the President's Cup in December, has continued his match play assault on American players this week, eliminating Steve Stricker and Leonard.,So Friday morning's third round will feature Woods vs. Stewart Cink, Langer vs. Maggert, Glasson vs. Andrew Magee, Maruyama vs. Loren Roberts, Fred Couples vs. Steve Pate, Phil Mickelson vs. Eduardo Romero, Steve Jones vs. Jose Maria Olazabal, and John Huston vs. Patrik Sjoland.,One of those 16 will emerge Sunday as the champion and earn $1 million. But with 17 of the top 20 seeded players eliminated after two days, it is anyone's guess who will prevail.,''We knew there were going to be top seeds that lost,'' said Mickelson, who defeated Lee Janzen, 2 and 1. ''But we didn't expect 90 percent of them to lose.'',In golf, however, unlike tennis or college basketball, the difference between a No. 1-seeded and a No. 64-seeded player is a fine line, one that becomes even more vague under the pressure of match play.,Today at La Costa Resort and Spa, there were numerous momentum-changing shots, and most of them went in favor of the lower-seeded players. In the midst of the surprises, there was great golf and high drama. Woods was pushed to the limit. Tway came within an inch of tying the match at No. 16, barely missing a 20-foot putt for birdie that hung on the front lip of the hole. Then the final heartbreak for Tway came at No. 18. Woods hit a difficult chip shot badly near a greenside bunker at No. 18, giving Tway an opportunity to even the match with a 10-foot putt for par. The putt looked good right up until it slid just past the left edge of the cup. Tway closed his eyes in anguish, while Woods breathed a sigh of relief.,''To be able to survive a match like this and get to the next round, I am relieved,'' said Woods. He faces a difficult match against Cink, who beat Woods in match play in college. ''The field is so deep here. People have failed to realize that. And over 18 holes, anything can happen.'',While Woods looked ahead, Tway was in the clubhouse, trying to figure out how his putts on No. 16 and No. 18 stayed out of the hole. ''I thought both of them were in,'' said Tway. ''I knew I would be the underdog, but it didn't bother me. I knew if I played well, I'd have a chance.'',But others lost their chance today, including Greg Norman, who squandered a 3-up lead through 14 holes and lost to Romero on the third hole of sudden death. Romero extended the match with a terrific approach shot under pressure, hitting a 7-iron from 169 yards at No. 18 to within a foot of the hole. That led to a birdie.,''I think that was the best shot of my life,'' said Romero.,Norman almost lost on the second hole of sudden death when he pulled his tee shot off a cart path out of bounds, leading to a bogey. But Romero missed a five-foot putt to bogey as well. Romero clinched the match on the next hole with a 20-foot birdie putt.,''Congratulations to him,'' Norman said. ''He was a great competitor.'',When asked about his errant drive on the second playoff hole, Norman said, ''I pulled it, landed on the cart path, and it went o.b. That is nothing but bad luck.'',More twists and turns are in store for Friday, when the field is cut from 16 to the final four, with eight matches in the morning and four quarterfinal matches in the afternoon. Advancing to Saturday's semifinals may require playing 36 holes or more on Friday. Some players wondered how they would handle it.,''This is nerve-racking stuff,'' said Couples, who won a difficult 1-up match over Scott Hoch. ''Tiger won a close match because he played good. I won a close match because I was lucky. I don't even know who I play tomorrow. But this stuff makes me so nervous, I will be choking like a dog.''",CLIFTON BROWN,"FEB. 26, 1999","WORLD GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS: SECOND ROUND; Like Dominoes, the Top Players Fall",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/sports/world-golf-championships-second-round-like-dominoes-the-top-players-fall.html

"Twenty months ago, after more than a decade on public assistance, Ann McGinniss transformed herself from a welfare mother into a working mother.,She now follows the rhythms of suburban parenthood, rising before dawn to prepare her daughter and son for school, then driving from her home in Peekskill, N.Y., to her bookkeeping job at a nearby car dealership.,Her income -- $290 a week, take home -- means she is doing too well to qualify for food stamps. Yet after rent, car payments, insurance and utilities, she says, she has almost no cash left for food. So almost every weekend, she reverts to a ritual of poverty. She enlists her 12-year-old son to help her lug bags of groceries gleaned from food pantries in the basements of churches in their community 30 miles north of New York City.,She is 40 years old now. Work, she had hoped, would allow her to end a life of dependency. But she has simply come to rely on private largesse instead of public aid. ''I'm tired of always having to say, 'Please help me,' '' she said.,Ms. McGinniss is part of a stream of low-wage workers, retirees and refugees from public assistance who are swelling the lines at soup kitchens and food pantries across America.,Some, like Ms. McGinniss, are the welfare-to-work versions of an old phenomenon: the working poor caught in the middle -- too well off for public assistance but not well off enough to make it on their own. Some are immigrants, here legally but cut off from food stamps under new Federal welfare laws. Some are following a path of least resistance: rather than jump through hoops meant to tarnish the appeal of public aid, they are turning to private charities that ask few questions and require little in return for the food they give away. And some are lining up for free food simply because it is there.,Together, they are changing the face of food lines long occupied by the addicted, the disabled, the generally down-and-out. And they may help explain a puzzle confronting poverty analysts: Why have the lines kept growing when unemployment is at its lowest level in a generation and the economy has remained healthy for years?,Statistically, the picture remains murky. Neither the charities nor the Federal Government have done detailed year-by-year studies of food charities or their clientele. Even so, several states have measured a steady growth in the doling out of free food.,In New York, the number of grocery handouts and soup kitchen meals rose dramatically between 1987 and 1995, from 13.5 million to slightly more than 21 million. And officials believe the growth has continued.,Across the country in Arizona, the picture looks much the same. After holding fairly steady from 1990 to 1993, the number of meals distributed through the statewide food-charity network has since risen 50 percent. And a 1997 study found that 41 percent of the network's client families had at least one person with a job.,The reasons for this rising demand are not much more precise than its statistical dimensions. But on both sides of the ideological aisle, many agree that tough welfare policies -- and general squeamishness about public assistance these days -- have had some role in lengthening the food lines.,Most of all, attention has focused on food stamps: specifically, on a deep and unexpected drop in the number of people receiving them, from 28 million to fewer than 19 million over the last four years.,Federal food-stamp officials and advocates for the poor say this decline is far too steep to be attributed simply to welfare-to-work success. Many people, they believe, remain eligible for food stamps, but are shying away or being pushed away by overzealous local officials. And there is growing evidence, they say, that  significant numbers of them are finding their way to the food lines. Indeed, it was just that concern that late last year led the Department of Agriculture, which runs the food-stamp program, to commission the first Federal study of who receives private food handouts and why. Findings are expected in July 2000.,Nowhere, perhaps, is there a starker sign of such a shift than in New York City, where workers at certain welfare offices, rechristened ''job centers,'' began encouraging applicants last year to go to food pantries instead of seeking food stamps. Last month, a Federal judge ruled that this and other new welfare application procedures had improperly denied people prompt access to food stamps and health coverage.,But a far fuller accounting comes from Wisconsin, which recently released a study of its welfare-to-work program, generally seen as the most rigorous and far reaching in the nation. While the state has had great success in moving people into jobs, the study found that after leaving the rolls, families were 50 percent more likely to say they did not have enough money for food. In all, nearly a third reported such problems.,Some conservative groups that have helped shape new welfare policies say that while tighter rulesmay have lengthened the lines, the shift from public to private aid is overdue. Charity, they say, is the responsibility of communities, not governments.,Other conservatives, though, question whether the lengthening food lines reflect dire need. Indeed, some of them say, if the private charities followed the trend in welfare offices and required work or stricter means tests, the lines would shrink. In essence, they say, the food pantries and soup kitchens are the last bastions of the free lunch.,''You're always going to find recipients diverted to the most lenient welfare system,'' said Robert Rector, a welfare analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington. ''They are breeding their own clientele.'',But many liberal analysts and food-charity workers insist that, in most cases, the need is quite genuine. ''Most people who don't have a real need don't go stand in lines at soup kitchens,'' said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group in Washington.,Whatever their motivation, rising numbers are repeat customers, not just people seeking a one-time boost to get through a crisis. And the growing presence of working people is leading the charities to adjust their schedules and their style.,A year ago, the pantry at St. Joseph's Church in the Rockland County community of Spring Valley, N.Y., began opening up on Wednesday evenings; 5:30 on a recent Wednesday brought a virtual rush hour, largely made up of working immigrants from Haiti. By 6, more than 100 shopping bags loaded with canned goods, bread and snacks were gone.,And at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew's food pantry on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, food is now displayed on shelves like those in a supermarket, rather than simply handed out in bags. The new setup, workers there say, dulls the stigma of accepting a handout.,''We've seen demand triple in the last 10 years,'' said Doreen Wohl, executive director of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, which runs the dispensary. ''People who are working come more, now that it feels like a store.'',The Limits of Income,Enough for Rent, But Not for Food,On a chilly morning in Greenwich, Conn., as Range Rovers and Lincoln town cars rolled along tree-lined Putnam Avenue, an inconspicuous trickle of people made a different commute: down stone steps and through a metal door into the basement of Christ Church, where low-income families in this high-income town receive weekly handouts from a charity called Neighbor to Neighbor.,Even in a well-off town like Greenwich, they were a microcosm of today's food lines.,Margaret Porter, 65, was laid off four years ago from a customer service job at Valley Labs, a subsidiary of Pfizer. Now, her Social Security payments and small pension add up to $1,000 a month, enough for her public housing rent and other expenses, but not for food. Her town social worker calculated she could qualify for food stamps, she said, but only about $10 a month. ''It just wasn't worth it,'' Ms. Porter explained.,Many others had jobs. There was a cook from a local French restaurant, a construction worker, housekeepers from nearby estates who made the minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, and a woman who cared for the children of housekeepers.,For some, the free food was less a way to stave off hunger than to preserve a precarious rendition of suburban stability.,Ronald Culver, 45, a bearded, booted construction worker, stopped by on his lunch break to pick up groceries for himself, his girlfriend, their 20-month-old baby and her three children. Although his girlfriend works at a pharmacy, together they barely make enough to pay their utilities, car costs and $1,500-a-month apartment rent, not a lot in a town where studio apartments go for $1,000 a month.,The demand for free food in Greenwich grew so much last year that when Neighbor to Neighbor's roster of certified clients hit 85, Greenwich opened its own food pantry in an unmarked walk-in closet in Town Hall.,Many of those seeking food have moved from public assistance to low paying jobs, said Elisabeth Steinberg, director of adult and family services for Greenwich. And while Connecticut has a relatively high cost of living, the jobs obtained by people leaving welfare are mostly part time, often lack benefits and average $6.12 an hour, she said.,To accommodate people whose work schedules conflict with the pantry hours, two town social workers have begun making food deliveries on their own time.,One of them, Cynthia Bowser, piled plastic bags of groceries into the back seat of her car on a recent morning, then circled a parking lot in the center of town until she spotted a faded black Oldsmobile parked amid the Explorers and Lexuses. The car belonged to Traci Camacho, 32, a mother of three who makes $8 an hour as a baby sitter at the Greenwich Y.M.C.A. Her husband, Erik, fixes elevators in New York City, but it costs him $280 a month just to commute.,The family missed qualifying for food stamps by a few dollars, Ms. Bowser said. So once a week, Ms. Camacho leaves the right front door of her car unlocked when she goes to work, and Ms. Bowser discreetly leaves the groceries inside.,Perhaps the most comprehensive statistical sign of this shifting clientele came in a survey of tens of thousands of food pantries and soup kitchens released last year by Second Harvest, the nation's largest private network of food charities and the source of much of the food at the Greenwich pantries. The survey found that 60 percent of the 21 million recipients of Second Harvest food in 1997 said they had sought handouts because of a chronic food gap, and nearly 40 percent of the households had at least one person employed.,In contrast, when Second Harvest was created 20 years ago, most of those seeking food were at charity's door for a one-time handout, after their lives had been disrupted by a layoff or some other emergency.,In Homestead, Fla., on the fringe of the Everglades southwest of Miami, crowds gather once or twice a month when a local group, Farm Share, hands out canned goods and unsold produce collected from nearby farms.,On a hot Wednesday morning, drawn by fliers and newspaper ads, dozens, then hundreds, of people gathered at a public park, towing collapsible shopping carts or children's toy wagons, many bringing folding chairs to endure the long wait in 90 degree heat. Some arrived hours before dawn  to claim slips of paper with numbers marking their places in line.,Volunteers and a work crew from a nearby prison set out half-ton bins of tomatoes and sweet potatoes, stacks of boxed papayas, and cases of frozen turkey breasts that steamed in the humid air.,Kimberly Johnson, 29, a mother of three and the wife of a cook earning $19,000 a year, said a friend had told her about the handouts last spring. Ms. Johnson, who recently returned to college, said she was reluctant to go, never having relied on charity or public aid. But after exhausting every other option, she said, she began making the 40-minute drive to Homestead.,''I make my own bread, I buy dry beans, I stretch the budget every way I can, but I still have to come,'' she said. ''I'm embarrassed and shocked,'' she added, scanning the ranks around her. ''People I know volunteer here.'',Food Stamp Drop-Off,Issues of Access And Eligibility,At 10:30 on a recent weekday morning, a caseworker began her standard speech to several dozen jobless men and women at the Hamilton Job Center, a former welfare office in upper Manhattan.,She gave a grim description of the city's workfare program and the relative benefits of even a minimum-wage job. Anyone looking for immediate help with food, she told them, was basically in the wrong place:,''This is a job center,'' she said. ''If you need food, we have lots of pantries that give good meat, good food.'',One who was turned away was 25-year-old Lakisha Reynolds, who had sought food stamps and public assistance for herself and her 3-year-old son in December, seven months after losing a full-time job and then a series of temporary jobs. In an affidavit filed as part of the Federal court suit against the city, she described the contents of her kitchen when she applied for help: ''a piece of meat, two cans of vegetables, three tangerines, some hot cereal, a little rice, and some carrots.'' By the time she arrived at the food pantry that she was sent to, it had run out of food, she said.,The city is now formulating new procedures for the job centers, in an effort to meet the objections the judge made as a result of the suit. In the interim, it has changed the morning routine at the Hamilton center, trading the staff speech for a videotape that makes no mention of emergency food stamps. Jobless people who ask for immediate food aid are directed to the line for welfare benefits, where they must demonstrate their eligibility for food stamps.,New York City's welfare authorities have sought an extraordinarily hard line. But across the nation, there is growing evidence linking the huge drop in the food stamp rolls and the growing lines at the food-charity doors.,Part of that drop can be attributed to the cutoff of food stamps to legal immigrants that went into effect in the summer of 1997. Surging lines at food charities through the following winter eventually prompted Congress to restore food stamps for immigrant children, the disabled and the elderly, but hundreds of thousands of immigrants remain without food stamps altogether.,Many other people, like Ann McGinniss, have lost food stamps because they now make too much money; the limit is $1,138 in monthly net income for a family of three. But often, what with today's anti-welfare climate, the deterrent is simply an unwillingness to deal with the hassle or stigma, or a lack of understanding on eligibility.,In Wisconsin's recent welfare study, for example, a third of former welfare recipients incorrectly believed that having a job automatically disqualified them from food stamps. Altogether, 49 percent stopped receiving food stamps after leaving the welfare rolls, many more than could be accounted for simply by a higher income, according to the study. And in Wisconsin, as in New York City, people without enough food are often told to head to a food pantry or soup kitchen.,In the wake of the study, officials in Wisconsin say they are planning to intensify their efforts to improve food stamp access.,Perhaps the clearest statistical line away from government aid to private charity comes from Arizona, where the drop in food stamp use has almost precisely paralleled the rise in demand on the state's food charities: From March 1994 to July 1998, participation in the food stamp program declined more than 50 percent, according to studies by state and Federal poverty groups. In roughly the same period of time, there was a 50 percent increase in meals distributed through the state's charity network.,The Hunt for Meals,Full Refrigerators Turn Empty Again,The statistics translate into a subculture in which households float between work and welfare, food stamps and food pantries. Sometimes, the hunt for food can seem like a second job.,In Newburgh, N.Y., Yolanda Baptist and her boyfriend, Lawrence McGriff, both 30, have a strict routine to feed themselves and Ms. Baptist's three children. Following a guide distributed by a local ministry, they walk around town for handouts or hot meals, visiting different charities on different days.,Mr. McGriff's last job was at a Burger King, but he stopped working after he broke his ankle.  Ms. Baptist has been selling Avon products, but still manages to receive welfare benefits.,On the eighth day of every month, Ms. Baptist picks up and spends her food stamps. Recently, after a $130 shopping trip, she filled the refrigerator, which the day before contained nothing except a few leftovers and a small hunk of ham. Then she began filling a separate freezer the family had found on the street; they use it as a kind of savings account, for food instead of money. By the end of the month, the account would be drawn down nearly to zero again.,In Peekskill, Ann McGinniss's life got more difficult this month when her family lost its Medicaid benefits because of her income, adding medical bills to an already tight budget. To get a little extra food, she continues to tell the volunteers at some food pantries that she has four children, even though her two oldest no longer live at home.,With just $50 or $100 a month in food stamps, she said, ''I could make it.'' Still, if a life of handouts is the price of staying employed, it is worth it; anything, she added, is better than the years she lost on welfare -- a stream of soap operas watched from the couch, punctuated by fights with her longtime boyfriend, who has since fled to Florida without paying child support.,''One way or the other,'' she said, ''I'm not going back.'',NEXT: As demand for donated  food rises, supplies are lagging.",ANDREW C.

"Today's pop quiz: Was this full-page newspaper advertisement the handiwork of the Democratic or Republican Party?,In the advertisement, addressed to the American people, readers are told: ''We are committed to saving Social Security for today's seniors, tomorrow's baby boomers and for their children. As important as Social Security is for the nation's retirees, we also need to create the world's best schools for our children.'',And, in a nod to blue-collar voters, the advertisement says, ''Our plan to ease the tax burden will put more money in the pockets of middle-class Americans so they can provide more for their families, while making Government less wasteful and more efficient.'',With its Democratic buzzwords and its photographs of an African-American family, an elderly couple, a female teacher and a man in a military uniform, the advertisement looks and sounds like it came out of the White House public relations' shop -- or from the Democratic leadership in Congress.,Surprise, surprise. The advertisement was signed by Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, and the House Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, and paid for by the Republican National Committee. It appeared on Tuesday in USA Today, and the party sent it in the form of a ''letter to the editor'' to hundreds of newspapers nationwide.,The ''open letter'' is the latest demonstration of how Republicans are trying to repair their image after impeachment and to strike an accommodating tone with the public, and perhaps even with the Democrats.,Yet even some Republicans in the capital are grousing that the advertisement may as well have featured a white flag rather than an American flag in the background.,On virtually every issue cited -- whether the budget, welfare reform, crime, Social Security or education -- polls show that the public now trusts Democrats as much as or more than Republicans.,''It's quite a departure,'' said Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, who allowed that he, happily, could have signed the advertisement. ''Some are saying, 'Two or three years ago, we would have paid for an ad to run like that in the early Gingrich days.' '',James Carville, President Clinton's sharp-tongued political adviser, put it this way: ''There's not one thing in that ad that I'm not vehemently for. There's maybe a little too much class warfare even for me. The reverse would be the Democrats running an ad saying, 'The burden of regulation is stifling economic growth in America. And the tax code is so complicated that there are more words in it than the Bible and the Koran put together.' '',Deriding such critics, Mike Collins, a spokesman for the Republican Party, said, ''Since when do Democrats have a monopoly on working people? They're the ones who have been taxing working men and women 40 percent of their income. This ad was a way for the Republicans to ratify to the American people -- as we did in '94 -- what we were sent here to do.'',The advertisement was hatched by Representative J. C. Watts Jr., the new chairman of the House Republican Conference, who took the idea to Mr. Hastert, who then took it to Mr. Lott.,Mr. Carville's critique spurred Lauren Maddox, Mr. Watts's spokeswoman, to ask: ''Is James really going to join our party? The door's always open.'',Kidding aside, the advertisement unnerved conservatives who for years have accused Mr. Clinton and the Democrats of appropriating their issues.,''The underlying message,'' said William W. Pascoe 3d, political director of the American Conservative Union, ''is: 'We want to be bipartisan. We're not just the party of impeachment.' But I don't know that we have any issues left to drive wedges into the Democratic coalition. Nobody has a clue as to an agenda that will light a fire under the American people.'',The advertisement does contain clues that it was the work of Republicans. It offers more praise, for example, for the Republican-controlled Congress than for the Democratic White House. ''Congress has succeeded in implementing policies that work for the American people,'' it says. And it calls for strengthening the military, asserting, ''Shrinking defense resources have worn down our equipment and hurt troop morale.'' (But even in their oratory, Democrats like to toss in a line now and then about the importance of a vigorous defense.),Mr. Daschle was more concerned about what was not in the advertisement.,''Obviously, there are a lot of omissions,'' he said. ''They don't have some of the other things that we would want to protect Medicare, patient's bill of rights, minimum wage, campaign finance reform. But clearly the agenda that they've articulated is one that we're very excited about -- and have been pushing for years, if not decades.'',But Jorge Martinez, who works for a Republican consulting firm that put the finishing touches on the advertisement, warned that Democrats had better not gloat. ''They're jealous, of course,'' he said, ''because they didn't think of it.''",RICHARD L.

"Only two months after the New York Stock Exchange agreed to build a new trading complex on Wall Street, landlords and downtown civic leaders are waging a last-ditch effort to keep the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq from moving to midtown from the city's historic financial district in lower Manhattan.,They contend that the departure of the two stock markets and about 2,500 jobs would undermine the financial district and hurt the downtown office market, which only recently recovered from a devastating recession in the early and mid-1990's.,The American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which are subsidiaries of the National Association of Securities Dealers, have said they would like to move to a new trading floor and a combined headquarters in a proposed skyscraper a block from Times Square, although they are considering several spots downtown as well.,Last November, the city granted the two stock markets a ''portable'' $200 million package of tax breaks and other incentives that could be used anywhere in Manhattan. Stock brokers, real estate interests and government officials have been awaiting a formal decision on a site ever since, though few believe that there is much chance of a downtown location.,Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the N.A.S.D., is expected to make a final decision within 60 days. To complicate matters, Mr. Zarb has told city and state officials that he wants to reopen the negotiations in light of a far more generous benefits package granted to the New York Stock Exchange.,But while city and state officials struggled to keep the New York Stock Exchange in the financial district, they have taken a ''neutral'' position on a future home for the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Neutrality, downtown advocates contend, effectively encourages a move to midtown and subsidizes office space that is far more expensive than it would be downtown. The Downtown Lower Manhattan Association has also said that the city's position is at odds with the Giuliani administration's often-stated policy to stabilize the downtown area.,In December, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the city and state's $900 million deal to keep the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan was justified ''because it will keep the financial sector's center of gravity in lower Manhattan.'',James F. Gill, chairman of the Battery Park City Authority, which has a vacant parcel in lower Manhattan that could be developed for Nasdaq and the American Exchange, said: ''It makes sense to have them in the financial center. The downtown area would suffer. And it would be bizarre to see them at 42d Street and Sixth Avenue.'',Although Battery Park is controlled by the state, Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, has shown no inclination to push Mr. Zarb toward lower Manhattan. Mr. Gargano and Deputy Mayor Randy Levine have said the deal was a coup for the city because the National Association of Securities Dealers has agreed to move its headquarters to New York from Washington and to combine its existing operations in New York.,The exact location, they say, is up to Mr. Zarb. Nevertheless, the city and the state have expressed a willingness to use the condemnation process to help the developer, Douglas Durst, assemble a site at 42d Street and the Avenue of the Americas for Nasdaq.,''Zarb doesn't want to be in the shadow of the New York Stock Exchange,'' one financial executive who works with Mr. Zarb said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''He wants the forward-looking, go-go image he could get in Times Square.'',At the same time, Jerry Speyer, chairman of Tishman Speyer Properties, and John Zuccotti, chairman of Brookdale Financial Properties, which owns the World Financial Center at Battery Park City, have been wooing Nasdaq downtown and vying with each other to build the project.,The debate is only the latest chapter in a sometimes contentious history with the city's financial industry, which accounts for only 5 percent of the jobs in New York but the bulk of the tax revenues. Over the last four years, city and state officials have agreed to provide a total of $1.4 billion in tax breaks, cash and other incentives for four financial markets in Manhattan after each of them made a threat to move to New Jersey.,Despite signing an agreement with the city and the state in November, Mr. Zarb wants a better deal that would make it more economical to move to the midtown site owned by Mr. Durst. The New York Stock Exchange deal is worth about $200,000 per job, compared with about $80,000 per job for the smaller Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange. Two executives with knowledge of the negotiations say Nasdaq is seeking an additional $80 million to $100 million.,''As we go down the road, we're looking at the costs associated with any type of activity in New York and weighing that against the package that is on the table,'' said Michael Jones, chief administrative officer at N.A.S.D. ''At the end of the day, this has to make economic sense.'',But city and state officials said they would not renegotiate.,''As far as we're concerned, we've done our financial deal with Nasdaq,'' said Mr. Levine, the Deputy Mayor.,Real estate experts said a downtown project was not cheaper or more viable unless the city and the state provided additional incentives, or free land, that would function as yet another subsidy.,''We think it's great that the Governor and the Mayor attracted Nasdaq to New York,'' said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. ''We realize that the decision about where they locate is ultimately Nasdaq's. But we do hope that at the end of the day, they'll stay downtown.''",CHARLES V.

"Virginia Foster Durr, a well-born civil rights campaigner who was on hand when Rosa Parks was bailed out of jail where she was being held for not giving up her seat on a bus to a white man in 1955, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Carlisle, Pa. She was 95.,Mrs. Durr and her husband, Clifford, a lawyer, were New Deal veterans who were in the thick of the civil rights movement in their native Alabama in the 1950's and 1960's.,President Clinton said, in a statement: ''A white woman, born to privilege in the Deep South, Mrs. Durr refused to turn a blind eye to racism and intolerance in our society. Her courage and steely conviction in the earliest days of the civil rights movement helped to change this nation forever.'',In 1955 Mrs. Durr and her husband helped a black civil rights leader, E. D. Nixon, bail Mrs. Parks, a black seamstress active in the N.A.A.C.P., out of jail in Montgomery, Ala., said Dr. Patricia Sullivan, a historian and fellow at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute of Afro-American Research at Harvard University.,Mrs. Parks's action touched off the Montgomery bus boycott by blacks, which helped spur the civil rights movement and brought the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence.,Mrs. Parks said in a letter to the Durr family: ''I will miss you, old soldier, but the rich legacy you have passed to your children, grandchildren and great-grands lives on. We still have a long ways to go, but you, my friend, have made it easier for all of us.'',A native of Birmingham, Ala., Virginia Foster was reared there in the traditions of the Old South. She was a debutante, was prominent in the local Junior League and attended Wellesley College.,She moved to Washington in the 1930's, when Mr. Durr was on the staff of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In the Washington of the 1930's, many New Deal Young Turks clustered around the couple. Her personal liberalism found expression in those years, and she was a founding member of the interracial Southern Conference for Human Welfare, which opposed segregation.,Mrs. Durr also helped Eleanor Roosevelt generate support for legislation to end the poll tax, which helped prevent many Southerners from voting. In 1948 she was an unsuccessful candidate of Henry A. Wallace's Progressive Party for the Senate from Virginia.,Three years later the Durrs moved to Montgomery, where they supported the bus boycott and other civil rights activities. In 1954 she was summoned before the Senate's Internal Security Subcommittee after being accused of harboring Communist sympathies. She testified that she did not belong to the Communist Party and had not attended any party meetings.,As Rosellen Brown, a novelist, has put it, ''While the majority of Alabamians considered Virginia and Clifford Durr traitors, not heroes, they represented to many of us the best of the white South, its native strength: they were sensible, outspoken, committed and only accidentally heroic.'',Mrs. Durr won applause for her autobiography, ''Outside the Magic Circle'' (University of Alabama, 1985)'' edited by Hollinger F. Barnard. Dr. Sullivan is also editing a  book of Mrs. Durr's letters.,The Durrs were married in 1926. Mr. Durr died in 1975.,Mrs. Durr is survived by four daughters, Ann Durr Lyon of Harrisburg, Pa., Lucy Durr Hackney of Philadelphia, Virginia Foster Durr of Sweden, Me., and Lulah Durr Colan of Milwaukee; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.",ERIC PACE,"FEB. 26, 1999","Virginia F.

"A coalition of nuclear-weapons experts called on the Clinton Administration today to revive stalled arms-control negotiations with Russia by making a series of bold and, if necessary, unilateral gestures to reduce nuclear stockpiles and build confidence.,In a report issued here, the Committee on Nuclear Policy, which represents a variety of arms-control organizations and research groups, said the Administration was losing the initiative by waiting indefinitely for the Russian Parliament to ratify the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start II, before taking new steps to reduce nuclear weapons.,Instead, the experts recommended, the United States and Russia should each begin to reduce total  stockpiles to 1,000 nuclear weapons, including strategic and battlefield warheads. At the peak of the cold war each side had more than 10,000 warheads, but the total number of nuclear weapons -- bombs or missiles -- has never been made public.,The experts -- who include the former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster, a former NATO commander -- also said both sides should take more missiles off alert and remove from their war plans options that call for massive nuclear strikes.,Although the committee said that the United States and Russia should work together on these objectives, it concluded that the Administration could by itself give new impetus to arms control and reduce what the experts view as dangerous instability in Russia's nuclear forces.,''To continue to rely solely on the stalemated Start process is to needlessly increase the costs and risks of maintaining U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals at levels well in excess of what is needed to deter an attack,'' the committee's report concluded.,Under Start I, signed in 1991, the United States and Russia have reduced their strategic nuclear warheads from more than 10,000 to about 6,000. Start II would reduce each side's arsenal to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads. The Senate approved the treaty in 1995, but it has languished in Russia's Parliament for six years.,Although President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government supports ratification, votes have been repeatedly postponed, mostly recently in the wake of December's American-led raids on Iraq, which Russia opposed.,Robert G. Bell, special assistant to the President for defense policy and arms control at the National Security Council, said the recommendations were ''well intentioned'' but went too far. ''At the end of the day, the proposals are too ambitious and too idealistic,'' he said.,But the coalition, coordinated by the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, cited President Bush's sweeping, unilateral decision in 1991 to remove tactical nuclear weapons from overseas bases and from surface ships and to take 1,000 warheads on B-52's and some missiles off alert. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev quickly reciprocated, clearing the way for the Start II agreements.,Michael Krepon, president of the Stimson Center, an independent military research organization, said the Administration -- and Congress -- had not paid enough attention to the extent of the deterioration of Russia's nuclear forces, driven by its collapsing economy.,''They'll become very focused on this problem after something terrible happens,'' he said.,The committee also called on the Administration to spend far more to improve safeguards for Russia's nuclear arsenal. Mr. Clinton has proposed increasing such spending to $4.5 billion over the next five years, from the $2.5 billion now budgeted.",STEVEN LEE MYERS,"FEB. 26, 1999",U.S. Urged to Reduce Nuclear Arsenal to Revive Russian Talks,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/us-urged-to-reduce-nuclear-arsenal-to-revive-russian-talks.html
"On the eve of a review of economic sanctions against Libya, the Clinton Administration has asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to handle all communications with Tripoli about the turnover of two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan American flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, Mr. Annan indicated today.,The Administration has also asked Mr. Annan to discourage efforts by two envoys from Saudi Arabia and South Africa to give Libya further assurances about the trial, the treatment of the suspects or sanctions if the men are handed over, according to Administration officials and diplomats involved in the consultations.,The decision to narrow the mediation effort reflects what one diplomat and American officials called growing concern that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, might be receiving ''mixed messages'' from Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, and Jakes Gerwel, an emissary from the South African President, Nelson Mandela. Each envoy has made more than one trip to Tripoli trying to break the impasse between Libya and the Security Council over where and how the suspects should be turned over and tried, and the fate of sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992.,An Administration official said that as the sanctions review approached and efforts to resolve the crisis intensified, there was ''growing concern'' in Britain and the United States that Colonel Qaddafi might be hearing assurances that neither the United States nor Britain would agree to.One diplomat expressed concern that ''we were not all reading from the same script.'',Mr. Annan confirmed that he had met with Prince Bandar and Mr. Gerwel on Tuesday in Washington. He said he was ''very appreciative'' of all that the envoys had done at his request to help clarify the procedures under which Libya would hand over the men for trial in a Scottish court in the Netherlands.,While refusing to disclose specific content, Mr. Annan said that he had told the envoys that the issue was ''in the final stages before a decision.'',The Libyans, Mr. Annan said today, had asked for reassurances on one or two issues, which he refused to disclose, but which diplomats said involved the eventual lifting of sanctions. But he said he believed that the time for further clarifications and assurances had passed. ''It's decision time,'' Mr. Annan said. Libya, he added, ''must decide based on all the explanations they have heard whether or not to move forward.'',Last December, the Secretary General traveled to Libya, diplomats said, after Colonel Qaddafi suggested through emissaries that he was prepared for a breakthrough if Mr. Annan made the visit. There was considerable disappointment in Washington and New York when Mr. Qaddafi continued seeking further clarifications and assurances instead of turning over the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.,This afternoon, Mr. Annan met with Abuzed Omar Dorda, Libya's Ambassador to the United Nations, apparently to emphasize his view that the time for a decision had come, diplomats said.,Peter Burleigh, the American representative at the United Nations, said the Administration agreed. ''The time for procrastination is over,'' he said. ''We need action now from the Libyans.'',But immediate action is not likely, despite President Clinton's recent promise to seek stronger measures against Libya if it doesn't comply with demands that the men be handed over. On Friday Mr. Annan is expected to report to the Security Council on the issue.,But diplomats here said there was little chance that the Security Council would approve stronger measures Friday. Instead, the officials and diplomats said, the Council is expected to ask Libya to provide a definitive answer about whether it will turn over the suspects within a specified time period, which some said would be 30 days.,Officials familiar with the Libyan consultations say that Colonel Qaddafi's major concern is whether the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Libya will be lifted. A Security Council resolution approved last August states that as soon as the Council has been informed that the suspects have safely arrived in the Netherlands, sanctions are to be ''suspended immediately,'' and 90 days later could be formally lifted.",JUDITH MILLER,"FEB. 26, 1999",U.S. Seeks to End 'Mixed Messages' Over Lockerbie Suspects,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/us-seeks-to-end-mixed-messages-over-lockerbie-suspects.html
"Who are all these 43.4 million Americans, at the Census Bureau's last count, who do not have health insurance? Who runs the least risk in going without it? (Children.) Who runs the most, medical and financial? (Sick people approaching 65.) Who is most likely to have it? (People over 65.) Not to have it? (Adults who work for low wages.) Who doesn't care? (Invincible youth.),For more than a decade, an average of a million Americans a year have either lost their health insurance or failed to obtain insurance for which they became eligible. The reasons vary: prohibitively priced premiums, reduced employer coverage,  the welfare overhaul.,But whatever the causes, the growth in the number of uninsured is a startling anomaly in an economy that has been able to subdue inflation, unemployment and budget deficits. Much to the dismay of advocates for the uninsured, the United States, despite its bounty, stands almost alone among industrial nations in not providing free basic health care for all.,''The number is going in absolutely the wrong direction,'' said Grace-Marie Arnett, president of the Galen Institute, a conservative health and tax policy organization. ''It shows something is wrong with the system.'',And with the rise in the cost of insurance and health care outrunning wage gains, said Paul Fronstin, an analyst at the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute, ''this is going to get worse unless something is done about it.'',The what to do about it, long primarily the concern of liberals, is now being weighed by politicians across the political spectrum. The still evolving proposals range from expansion of government insurance programs to tax breaks helping more people buy coverage.,But while there is debate on how to help the uninsured, few experts disagree on who they are.,To begin with, not many are among the elderly or the seriously disabled, most of whom are covered by Medicare. Another group, some five million to six million, have family incomes exceeding $75,000 a year and can usually afford the insurance that, for any number of reasons, they do without.,Almost 11 million are children, from families that range from indigent to well off. But children are a less compelling concern to many health system analysts than are large numbers of the other uninsured. First, they are generally healthier than adults and less expensive to treat. And second, alone among the uninsured, they have already been singled out for help, under a $24 billion, five-year program for non-Medicaid-eligible children that was approved by Congress in 1997.,That leaves the rest of the uninsured, those who need coverage most: 25 million to 30 million people who have the greatest chance of becoming ill and cannot pay for care when they do. Demographically, they run the gamut.,''Some work, and some don't,'' said Katherine Swartz, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''Some don't work because they're sick. Some are very young adults not covered by their parents' health insurance. They take jobs serving latte in coffee shops that are not likely to have health insurance. They just don't think about the risks.'',The income of many is so low that  they cannot afford to buy insurance,  Professor Swartz said, but not so low that they qualify for Medicaid. Others may qualify but fail to apply, because of ignorance, language barriers or a general sense of intimidation.,Most of the uninsured in the greatest need of coverage ''are working adults who are not quite in the middle class,'' said David B. Kendall, health policy analyst at the Progressive Policy Institute. ''They are the folks who don't have a job that's going to be there for a lifetime.'',Minority groups account for a disproportionate number of the uninsured, Mr. Kendall said. Hispanic Americans, nearly half of whom under 65 lack insurance, are only 11 percent of the population but 21 percent of all the uninsured. Experts say there are several reasons, among them that Hispanic immigrants tend to be healthy and in addition may be intimidated by language and cultural barriers from applying for Medicaid or other assistance.,The travails of the uninsured are often dismissed because the law assures them the last-resort, safety-net care of emergency rooms, says Drew E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. But by the time they call the ambulance, Mr. Altman notes, many have gone without the preventive care that might have averted the crisis.,A survey of adults under 65 by Kaiser and the Commonwealth Fund found that in a single year, 24 percent of the uninsured declined to fill a prescription that had been given them by a doctor, compared with 6 percent of those who had insurance. Fifty-one percent had encountered difficulty obtaining care, as against 10 percent of the insured. And 42 percent had not seen a doctor during the prior year, compared with 17 percent of the insured.,As a result, the uninsured are sicker than others, according to research last year by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a group supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The study found that 16.3 percent of uninsured people under 65 were in fair to poor health, compared with 10.6 percent of all people under 65.,One explanation for the rise in the uninsured is the shift of people from welfare to work. More than six million have left the welfare rolls in the last five years, many for low-wage jobs with employers that do not offer any insurance or that charge a lot for it. For these workers, there is help for a while from Medicaid, the Federal-state insurance program for the poor, which is automatically granted welfare recipients. In most states, families can remain on Medicaid for a year after leaving the cash-assistance rolls.,But then, said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families U.S.A., a consumer advocacy group, ''their reward is the loss of health insurance.'',Another reason for the swelling in the number of uninsured is the rising cost of health care -- for hospital stays, visits to the doctor and prescription medicine alike. It is climbing faster than workers' wages, and,  on top of the general increase in the cost of care, employers are asking workers to pay a larger share of that cost.,In 1985, nearly two-thirds of all businesses with 100 or more employees paid the full cost of a worker's care, a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found. A decade later only a third did so. Kaiser also says  employers who ask workers to pay part of the cost through payroll deductions had raised the workers' share to 22 percent on average by  1996, from 13 percent in 1988.,As a result, a survey by the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research found, one in four workers who were offered employer-subsidized insurance in 1997 declined to sign up. A decade ago, only one in ten declined.,These changes, analysts say, have spawned the largest segment of the uninsured, the working poor.,Young adults -- some poor, some not -- are another large group of the uninsured. Of 65 million up to 34 years old, nearly 25 percent are uninsured (compared with 13 percent of the rest of the population), and they account for nearly 40 percent of all the uninsured.,Of the youngest among them, those 19 to 24, the Center for Studying Health System Change says, 30 percent are not offered insurance through their jobs. Of those who are offered it, typically for a few hundred dollars a year, 30 percent turn it down.,Some who reject it are working poor and cannot afford it. Others, feeling invincible, simply spend the money on something else. But in forgoing regular care, the youngest appear to pay a toll as they age. The center reports that nearly 18 percent of the uninsured from 25 to 34 years old are in fair to poor health, compared with 10 percent of all people their age.,However much some young adults feel they can do without insurance, the nation has an incentive to help them buy it, analysts say. Like safe drivers who never have accidents and yet are required to buy car insurance, these young people, by paying health insurance premiums, would help defray the cost of care for people who are frailer and older. This process of subsidizing one group whose purchases then serve to subsidize others is called cross-subsidizing.,Among the beneficiaries of cross subsidies would be a not so obviously needy group of the uninsured: the poorer and sicker, often retired and homebound, among the 23 million  Americans who, age 55 to 64, are not yet eligible for Medicare.,According to the Center for Studying Health System Change, people in that age group have average family incomes of $45,800 a year, about $4,000 more than the average for all families and enough to permit nearly 90 percent of them to pay the age group's high premiums of close to $3,000 a year, even if the employer pays no share.,But the three million among them who are uninsured earn an average of only $18,000. The center reports that a third of them are in particularly perilous straits: these one million are in ill health and have average incomes of just $9,600, which puts private coverage far out of reach.,President Clinton has revived a proposal he made last year that would allow 55-to-64-year-olds the option of joining Medicare by paying $300 to $400 a month. But for these one million people in late middle age, even this plan would leave insurance  out of reach. At $400 a month, they would be spending half their income on Medicare.",PETER T.

"History will judge the Clinton Administration's foreign policy record partly by its success in helping Russia reduce the nuclear remnants of the cold war. Nothing would do more to protect American security in the decades ahead than insuring that Russia's immense stockpile of nuclear weapons and materials is diminished and adequately controlled. The modest amount of money needed to achieve these goals now could save Washington many billions of dollars in the future to deal with the Russian nuclear threat if it is not reduced.,Moscow still has 6,000 nuclear warheads poised for long-distance delivery. Weapons-grade plutonium from dismantled warheads is stored in poorly secured buildings, vulnerable to theft. Russia also has tens of thousands of underpaid weapons scientists and workers in 170 scientific institutes and 10 closed cities that house the Russian nuclear weapons complex. If President Clinton hopes to leave an enduring mark in international affairs, he will work on these problems in the remaining 23 months of his term. Specifically, he should look for innovative ways to further reduce nuclear weapons and speed the conversion of Russia's nuclear establishment to civilian activities.,The last nuclear arms reduction treaty, negotiated more than six years ago, has yet to be ratified by Russia's Parliament. That treaty alone would cut nuclear weapons totals nearly in half. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov recognizes the treaty's value for Russia, both in foreign policy and budget savings terms. Mr. Clinton should work closely with President Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Primakov to achieve ratification.,But hopes for deep nuclear cuts need not depend on Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament. In coordination with Russia's leaders, Mr. Clinton should initiate steps that go beyond the treaty, including parallel nuclear reductions and taking more weapons off hair-trigger alert. Such methods proved effective when tried by Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev a decade ago.,Shrinking Russia's nuclear infrastructure also requires expanding the cooperative programs developed under legislation originally sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar. These efforts have already supported the dismantling of some 5,000 Russian warheads. Additional work is needed now to safely convert as much of the plutonium and enriched uranium from these bombs into less dangerous forms and to store what remains under much more secure conditions. The Administration rightly seeks large spending increases in these programs in next year's budget. It is essential that Congress approve these requests.,Washington should also press ahead with its efforts to re-employ Russian weapons scientists in civilian work. Two American programs managed by the Energy Department are designed to achieve that goal. One, begun in 1994, is aimed at Russia's scientific institutes. A newer program deals with the closed nuclear cities. The scientific institutes program has succeeded in re-employing thousands of Russian scientists at home and keeping them out of the reach of terrorists or countries eager to make nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. But a report prepared for Congress this week by the General Accounting Office called attention to some problems, including taxation by Russia of some of the aid money and allegations that some assistance went to institutes and scientists still engaged in weapons work. However cash-starved the Russian Government is, taxation of American aid money is unacceptable. Nor should American subsidies support Russian weapons development.,The G.A.O. report calls for slowing down the  nuclear-cities program until the problems in the  institutes program have been resolved. That would be a mistake. The nuclear-cities agreement is more carefully drawn than its predecessor and already provides for exemption from Russian taxation. Tightened project review procedures are in place to make sure that Washington is not inadvertently subsidizing new Russian weapons development. These programs, along with Washington's contributions to Russia's plutonium and uranium conversion and security programs, should go forward as part of a coordinated drive to substantially eliminate Russia's cold-war nuclear infrastructure before the Clinton Administration leaves office.",,"FEB. 26, 1999",Unfinished Cold-War Business,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/opinion/unfinished-cold-war-business.html
"As Alice struggles to hang onto the squirming flamingo she is using as a croquet mallet, the hedgehog acting as the ball makes a face and curls itself into a perfect round shape. In this mad croquet game, the flamingos and hedgehogs are from Jim Henson's Creature Shop, and they are among the dozens of delightful puppets and animatronic characters that populate NBC's version of Wonderland.,Miranda Richardson strolls around as the screeching Queen of Hearts, her painted-on eyebrows and hair making her look as if she were, in fact, a playing card come to life. And in an inspired bit of casting, Robbie Coltrane and George Wendt turn up as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. With all that color and invention, why is NBC's three-hour ''Alice in Wonderland'' so flat?,When this Alice (Tina Majorino) follows the White Rabbit underground, it's as if she emerges in a theme park. Along for the ride, viewers glide past each episode as if watching vivid tableaux: there's the mad tea party, there's the Cheshire Cat! The film is a series of pretty set pieces that are never engaging.,There's a reason Lewis Carroll called his most famous book ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'' Though his dream world creates one of the most memorable and eccentric populations ever captured in one book, it is above all an adventure; its most energetic action, though, is a matter of storytelling and imagination. Adventure is missing from more than the title of NBC's ''Alice in Wonderland,'' a quasi-faithful version that preserves the shell but not the essence of Carroll's tale.,The film is, however, a triumph of design and smooth computer effects. With a look based on John Tenniel's classic illustrations, right down to Alice's pinafore and striped stockings, it leaps off the screen. Playing cards paint white rose bushes red; Alice grows taller than the trees, then shrinks to the size of a mushroom with magical ease.,This ''Alice'' roughly follows the outline of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' from her tumble down the rabbit hole to her presence in the  kingdom where the Queen of Hearts shrieks, ''Off with their heads!'' on a whim. The episodic structure of Carroll's tale allows the film to comfortably bring in characters from the book's sequel, ''Through the Looking Glass.'' Tweedledum and Tweedledee, those bizarrely overgrown bratty boys, are the best of those ''Looking Glass'' exiles. The croquet game may be the film's highlight, but other episodes stand out. It is impossible to ruin a mad tea party, especially when Martin Short plays a Hatter who dances on the table. Gene Wilder is touching and funny as the sad Mock Turtle, singing ''Soup of the evening/ Beautiful Soup.'',But while the film is a feast of casting, other characters are less successful. Ben Kingsley plays the hookah-smoking Caterpillar, changed here into Major Caterpillar. With gold braids on his red military jacket, he looks more like Sergeant Pepper. Whoopi Goldberg's face appears on the computer-generated, here-and-then-gone body of the Cheshire Cat, drawn in shades of black and white that create an eerily unreal effect. But like so much in this star-laden ''Alice,'' the Cat is less likely to inspire wonder than the recognition, ''There's Whoopi.'',Another problem comes from the frame tacked onto Carroll's story in this version, written by Peter Barnes (a co-writer of ''Merlin,'' last year's far more enchanting NBC special by the some producers). At the start, an unhappy Alice is being forced to sing at her parents' garden party. Fleeing in panic, she falls asleep under a tree and dreams of Wonderland, which is filled with variations of the party guests. In the garden, Ms. Richardson had been playing croquet and Mr. Short wearing an outrageous hat. The frame itself is not a terrible idea; Carroll himself invented the ''Alice'' characters as playful versions of people that he and his inspiration, Alice Liddell, knew.,The problem is that the device turns Alice's underground journey into one long anxiety dream. Every now and then she stops to remember she doesn't want to go back to reality and sing. Near the end, Alice declares, ''I am confident.'' The White Rabbit replies, ''Then you don't need us anymore,'' and she returns home. Playing therapist is not a natural role for the Rabbit, however Freudian a context some people choose to impose on ''Alice.'',The film keeps much of Carroll's language, but even on the page that language requires savoring and scrutiny; here it flashes by too quickly even to register as gleeful nonsense verse. And though Ms. Majorino is sometimes as petulant as Alice should be, more often she is pallid, traipsing through Wonderland without a sufficient sense of wonder.,''You've too much to say for yourself, Alice,'' the King of Hearts warns her, mere seconds before the house of cards tumbles all around her. If only he were right.,ALICE IN WONDERLAND,NBC, Sunday night at 8,(Channel 4 in New York),Robert Halmi and Robert Halmi Jr., executive producers; Dyson Lovell, producer; Nick Willing, director; written for television by Peter Barnes, based on the book by Lewis Carroll; music by Richard Hartley; Giles Nuttgens, director of photography.

"Raising a new objection to Donald J. Trump's plans to build the tallest residential tower in the world across the street from the United Nations building, opponents maintained yesterday that unless the height of the tower is reduced, residents of the upper stories would face dangerous levels of air pollution.,A report commissioned by the Beekman Hill Association, a group that includes a number of prominent East Side residents, asserts that the upper floors of the proposed 72-story building, on First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets, would lie in the path of a plume from Consolidated Edison's Waterside power plant. Levels of sulfur dioxide exceeding Federal limits would endanger the elderly, children and people suffering from asthma, the report said.,Mr. Trump said he had not seen the report, but he called the pollution argument ''totally ridiculous'' and pointed out that Con Ed announced last week that it planned to sell the site at First Avenue and 39th Street where the Waterside plant is situated.,But those plans would not eliminate the hazard, the report said, because the plant could not be closed until the capacity of another electricity-generating plant at 14th Street was increased sufficiently to compensate for the loss in power from Waterside, a process expected to last several years beyond the completion of the proposed Trump World Tower.,In a letter sent yesterday to the Department of Buildings and the Department of Health, the Municipal Arts Society, an influential citywide group that has joined the battle against Mr. Trump, said the pollution report showed that the project should be stopped. The step represents a departure for the civic group, which has cooperated with Mr. Trump on his Riverside South development on the West Side.,In the report, Daniel Gutman, an environmental engineer, said dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide combined with pollution from other sources would envelop the building at 650 feet and above, in violation of Federal air quality standards. The study was based on mathematical modeling methods used by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.,These findings show that the building would violate city building and health codes, Michael B. Gerrard, a lawyer representing the Municipal Arts Society, wrote in his letter to the city agencies.,Mr. Gutman, who also worked on Riverside South, said the air quality argument had been used successfully in the past to exact some concessions at Riverside South and Manhattan West, another residential complex, which are near a Con Ed plant on the West Side.,Asked about the Municipal Arts Society's decision to take on its former ally over Trump World Tower, Mr. Gerrard said, ''This is not directed at Trump personally but rather results from deep concerns: his proposed building and the lack of public review that preceded its approval.'',Mr. Trump said work had begun on the building's foundation. Construction is expected to take two years, he said.,Earlier this month, the Beekman Hill Association accused the Buildings Department of wrongfully allowing Mr. Trump to transfer development or air rights from other properties on the block so that he could make his new building taller. The association's members include Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citibank, and Walter Cronkite, the former television news anchorman.",TERRY PRISTIN,"FEB. 26, 1999","Trump Tower Would Lie in Path of Pollution, Critics Assert",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/trump-tower-would-lie-in-path-of-pollution-critics-assert.html

"After a year of slowly intensifying courtship, the Yankees and the Nets announced their plan yesterday to merge into a company called the YankeeNets and promised that each team would continue to operate separately.,''George Steinbrenner has made it clear that he won't run the Nets,'' said his spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, who spoke for both teams when the owners decided against talking to the news media. ''If he's asked his opinion, he'll give it.'',A definitive agreement has not been signed. The teams signed a letter of intent to create the YankeeNets, in which each team will be equal partners in a company designed to maximize the sale of local cable television rights, sponsorships, luxury suites, tickets and advertising.,To create their 50-50 partnership, the teams will exchange some stock and the Nets owners will contribute at least $350 million from outside investors.,One source of capital is to come from a group led by Allen & Company, an investment firm that is renowned for its entertainment industry deals. A second source of money could be Tishman Speyer Properties, the real estate developer.,Donald R. Keough, the chairman of Allen & Company, and Jerry I. Speyer, the president of Tishman Speyer, were named to the YankeeNets board of directors.,Although there are 14 individual owners or ownership groups that control two or more teams in the four major sports, including Time Warner (the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and the National Hockey League expansion Thrashers), the Walt Disney Company (the Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks) and Mike Ilitch (the Detroit Tigers and Red Wings) this is the first instance of two teams merging into one company.,In any case, the expansion of multiple-team ownership has occurred less for sporting reasons than for television and marketing advantages. Ultimately, it may not matter that the Nets have not won a championship since 1976, when they were in the American Basketball Association, and have started the lockout-shortened season with a spate of injuries and a 2-9 record.,''The record is temporary,'' Rubenstein said. ''They have very good ballplayers. With the drive these owners have, the Nets will be competitive.'',The news that the champion Yankees would combine with the Nets, a team with a far less hallowed history, stunned Roy C. Boe, who bought the Nets for about $100,000 in 1969 and owned them until 1978.,''Wow!'' Boe said from his home in Connecticut. ''Holy smokes! This is mind-boggling. I'm shocked they kept it a secret. It's hard to imagine the Yankees would merge with the Nets, but there must be things we aren't aware of yet.'',He speculated that Steinbrenner sees the wisdom in linking up with a National Basketball Association team, even after the lockout and despite the Nets' not having the marquee value of the Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers or Boston Celtics.,''The N.B.A. has made such incredible strides here and around the world,'' said Boe, who sold Julius Erving in 1976 before the Nets joined the N.B.A.,The main benefits of the merger for the Yankees seem to be the cash infusion from the new investors and the leverage a second team could create in talks to renew the teams' cable television deals with Cablevision's local sports channels: the MSG Network, which carries Yankees games, and Fox Sports New York, the Nets' channel.,The YankeeNets could also form their own sports channel or make a deal with ESPN or Time Warner to create a channel to compete with Cablevision.,But what the creation of the YankeeNets makes apparent -- at least for now -- is the death of talks with Cablevision to buy the Yankees, talks which had broken down last November.,Yesterday, James Dolan, Cablevision's president, said in a statement: ''Cablevision has enjoyed a longstanding, productive relationship with both organizations and we look forward to continuing those relationships.'',Those relationships could end soon. The Yankees' MSG deal ends after next season and the Nets' contract concludes after the 2001-02 season. If the Yankees leave, MSG could be badly hurt, without crucial, highly rated spring and summer programming.,''Had Cablevision bought the Yankees, they could have linked them up with the Knicks and Rangers, which would have been a better package than the Yankees-Nets,'' said Jeff Phillips, a vice president at Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, a Chicago investment bank that specializes in sports finance. Cablevision's ownership of Madison Square Garden includes the Knicks, the Rangers and the arena.,The talks between the Yankees and Nets began about a year ago when Steinbrenner, during meetings with Jerry L. Cohen, a member of the old and new Nets ownership groups, spoke about ''the potentials of the two clubs,'' Rubenstein said. Some of those talks were television-related, as Steinbrenner sought a way to build leverage with Cablevision, said one executive with knowledge of the early discussions.,Rubenstein said Steinbrenner ''was not negotiating in two places at once'' and described the early Nets talks as ''casual and friendly.'' With the apparent demise of the Yankees' talks with Cablevision, serious negotiations began between Steinbrenner and the Nets' new owners, including Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz, who took over the team in late October for $150 million.,Chambers's and Katz's 38 percent ownership share of the Nets belongs to a charitable trust that has said it will funnel all its profits toward inner-city youth programs in New Jersey. The trust, the Community Youth Organization, will remain in place and will own 20 percent of the YankeeNets. Bill Cosby, the entertainer, is a team investor and chairman of the trust.,In a statement, Steinbrenner said, ''Over and above the obvious business reasons for the partnering of the two teams, I was moved by the Nets' commitment to youth.'' Although it was not announced, the Nets' charitable efforts are expected to be extended to areas of New York City.,Rubenstein was unable to say precisely what impact, if any, the merger of the teams will have on the Yankees' pursuit of a new home in Manhattan or New Jersey, or whether they will stay in the Bronx at a new or renovated stadium.,''Steinbrenner is retaining all options, including New Jersey,'' Rubenstein said, adding that Steinbrenner is intrigued about whether the South Bronx area surrounding Yankee Stadium could become an empowerment zone, which would make it eligible for Federal assistance. ''If a lot can be done to rehabilitate the neighborhood, not just put in a new stadium, he'd be very interested.'',The Nets, meanwhile, have proposed moving to a new arena in downtown Newark from Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands Sports Complex.,''We don't think this will affect the Nets-Newark proposal or our plans to redevelop the Continental Arena,'' said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the arena's owner. ''And we haven't taken action on the baseball front in a long time.'',Rubenstein offered a ''no comment'' when asked whether the YankeeNets might sell stock in an initial public offering. Shares in the Boston Celtics, Cleveland Indians and Florida Panthers are now publicly traded.,With teams from two sports combined into one entity, Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College, cautioned, ''It's possible that Steinbrenner could shift revenues around to avoid additional revenue sharing in baseball or even shift around some N.B.A. revenues.''",RICHARD SANDOMIR,"FEB. 26, 1999",They're the YankeeNets: A Marriage Made for the Tube,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/sports/they-re-the-yankeenets-a-marriage-made-for-the-tube.html
"Hell has no colors in the infernal world of ''Not About Nightingales.'' In the director Trevor Nunn's enthralling interpretation of this tormented, long-lost drama by the young Tennessee Williams, which is only now making its New York debut, existence has been sapped of all hues but gray, black and white.,The island prison in which this work takes place, as conjured by the designer Richard Hoover in the intense, vivid production that opened last night at the Circle in the Square Theater, transmutes even an American flag, a child's rubber duck and a woman's blouse that is said to be chartreuse into the same bleak grisaille. Color is found only in real life, and what's going on in the tomblike, airless environment of ''Not About Nightingales'' is an antilife, composed, as one character puts it, of ''memories, shadows, ghosts.'' It is just one step away from death. It is even closer to madness.,Thomas Lanier Williams 3d, who would soon adopt the nom de plume Tennessee, was still waiting for his life to begin when he wrote this fascinatingly conflicted melodrama at age 27. He was staying, miserably, with his parents in Depression-era St. Louis, in the attic room of a house that had become, he wrote, frightening to him, and he had little hope in his future as a writer.,His journal entries from that time are filled with images of incarceration and escape, of claustrophobia and birds in flight. It was in this state of mind that he composed the play that at one point had the working title ''Hell.'' ''It may be very good or very bad,'' he wrote. ''I don't know.'',It is, in fact, both. ''Not About Nightingales,'' inspired by newspaper accounts of atrocities in a Pennsylvania prison, is the work of a man still unsure of his voice, writing to meet contemporary tastes in the polemical manner of Clifford Odets. (He submitted the play without success to Odets's producers at the Group Theater in New York.) On one level it closely follows the formulas of gritty, behind-bars movies like ''The Big House'' (1930), formulas that were already growing stale. There are definitely moments to wince over in ''Nightingales''; in the wrong hands it could emerge as a shrill piece of camp.,Yet just as the prisoners in the play chafe against the oppression of an inhuman institution, Williams twists and turns within the self-imposed confines of his generic plot, finally breaking through it with an agonized lyricism that is all his own. The young Tom Williams, whose beloved sister had recently been committed to a mental home, knew what it was like to feel shut out by life and to fear the loss of reason. A feverish, full-strength compassion for people in cages makes ''Nightingales'' fly toward a realm of pain and beauty that is the province of greatness.,Any hint of condescension or academic irony would destroy ''Not About Nightingales,'' as surely as the unicorn figurine in Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' is shattered by a clumsy visitor. That danger is carefully avoided by Mr. Nunn, his actors and his production team, who match Williams's empathy with unconditional commitment and passion.This loving, careful and precisely gauged interpretation nurtures the work into the full-blown life it deserves. If there were a Lazarus award for acts of resurrection in theater, this production would surely take the prize of the decade.,''Nightingales'' was first seen at the Royal National Theater in London, where Mr. Nunn is the new artistic director. The rights to the work had been acquired by the Moving Theater, which was created by Corin Redgrave, who stars here as the brutal warden, and his sister Vanessa, who tracked down the manuscript after finding references to it during research for her role in Williams's ''Orpheus Descending'' in the 1980's. This staged version is a collaboration among the National, the Moving Theater and the Alley Theater of Houston, where I first saw this production last year.,It was a revelation then, but in the succeeding months the show has taken on an even greater fluidity and dramatic momentum. Any stiffness or self-consciousness within the cast, a mixture of American and British performers, has been shed.,The actors make no wry apologies for characters who are, at least in their outlines, potboiler cliches. Even when the play drifts into the threadbare conventions of melodrama, and it does again and again, you are never tempted to snicker. The members of the ensemble here seem to believe so utterly in what they're doing that you have no choice but to go along with them.,As in so many prison melodramas, a hunger strike is the pivot of the plot, initiated here in response to an unvarying, ptomaine-inducing diet of spaghetti and meatballs. It is carried out by the usual lineup of cellblock archetypes, overseen by Mr. Redgrave's despotic warden.,There's Butch O'Fallon (James Black), the tough, domineering self-appointed leader of the strike; his strapping, less dynamic lieutenant, Joe (J. P. Linton), and the cock-sure, soon-to-be-crushed new boy, nicknamed Swifty (Mark Dexter). There are also the good-hearted Ollie (Dion Graham), sent to prison for stealing food to feed his family, and the sensitive and effeminate inmate, inevitably named the Queen (Jude Akuwudike), who delivers the quintessentially Williams declaration that ''all my life I've been persecuted by people because I'm refined.'',Before these disparate men looms, in addition to the habitual beatings administered by the guards, the threat of consignment to ''Klondike,'' a boiler room lined with steam radiators. (In the real-life events that inspired ''Nightingales,'' four men were cooked to death in such a chamber.) Klondike is the ultimate metaphor in the play's chain of images of suffocation, entombment and isolation, and the climate of fear it engenders is what gives the play its toxic life's blood.,In this increasingly claustrophobic world of deprivation, where the music of a passing cruise ship named the Lorelei drifts sirenlike through the prison windows, a taunting embodiment of freedom, no one is sure of his own senses anymore.,The specter of Sailor Jack (Matthew Floyd Miller), who has already gone ''stir-bugs'' when the play begins, hovers as an omen of an all-too-possible destiny for everyone in the play.,Another convict, Jim Allison (the excellent Finbar Lynch), a self-taught intellectual and the warden's flunky, finds his hands shaking from repression. The warden's pretty, plucky young secretary, Eva Crane (Sherri Parker Lee), will be driven to attempt suicide before the evening is over.,Even the lecherous, sadistic warden, Boss Whelan (Mr. Redgrave), has a moment in which he contemplates the degree to which his mind has been poisoned by his profession.,This inescapable, haunted anxiety is what makes ''Nightingales'' more than a lurid pulp tale on the one hand or a rancorous soapbox oration on the other. And the actors here unfailingly locate the fracturing crack in their characters' plaster personas. This is by no means an imposition but an elucidation of what is indeed in Williams's script.,Unlike similar heroines of the same era, Eva, played with refreshing straightforwardness by Ms. Lee, is able to admit her fascination as well as her repulsion for the predatory Whalen, anticipating the sexual ambivalence of the Blanches and Almas to come in the Williams canon.,Mr. Black gives convincing life to the poetic longings within Butch, embodied by the dream apparition of his dance hall sweetheart (Sandra Searles Dickinson), as well as his self-admiring machismo.,Mr. Redgrave and Mr. Lynch, as the respective embodiments of the play's social evils and its social conscience, are outstanding. Mr. Redgrave tempers Whalen's bilious cruelty and sinister, good-old-boy glee with a sweaty, humanizing anxiety.,And Mr. Lynch infuses every gesture with a sense of suppressed, self-cannibalizing energy that gives a startling credibility to even his baldest thematic speeches. If you want to grasp the soul of the play, you need only focus on Mr. Lynch's sharp, restless eyes, which bespeak an intelligence that is as much a curse as a blessing.,I have never known the awkward theatrical space that is Circle in the Square to be used as effectively as it is here, with the prisoners marching in lock step through the aisles and the guards suddenly materializing at your side. Mr. Nunn's staging extends the prison's boundaries to embrace the audience, further inhibiting any safe sense of a spectator's distance.,You're stirred, against your will, when Mr. Graham rises to his feet to lead the prisoners in a hymn of protest at meal time. When a searchlight interrupts a sexual tryst between Jim and Eva, you somehow feel personally violated.,Rendering the play visually in shades of black and white is a masterstroke, carried out with devious subtlety not only in Mr. Hoover's single, ingeniously versatile set but in Karyl Newman's period costumes and Chris Parry's crepuscular lighting, in which even the shadows have oppressive substance. The color scheme and the use of projected scene-setting supertitles bring to mind old movies and newspaper photographs, an acknowledgment of the play's status as artifact.,Yet as the evening proceeds, it seems to overflow with colors set pulsingly in relief by the stark frame of its setting.,Williams's palette was never monochrome. The emotions, both savage and painfully delicate, that saturate his work are arguably more rich and varied in tone than those of any American dramatist.,The colors are in the voices of Williams's entrapped nightingales, which are what these characters are despite the demurral of the title. They are colors that refuse to fade when the play is plunged into its concluding darkness.,NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES,By Tennessee Williams; directed by Trevor Nunn; sets by Richard Hoover; costumes by Karyl Newman; lighting by Chris Parry; associate director, Stephen Rayne; sound by Christopher Shutt; music by Steven Edis; fights by Malcolm Ranson; general manager, Florie Seery; technical supervisor, Aurora Productions; production stage manager, Michael Brunner; associate producer, Phyllis Wattis.

"Two gay men break up. One gives bisexuality a try with a woman he met at a publishing lecture; the other takes a shot at transvestism, in some divine 1950's fashions. Meanwhile back in the 1930's two sisters at Radcliffe are very upset about their college's nude posture photos.,''Triptych,'' Richard Willett's funny, insightful new play, ties those stories together and throws in references to ''The Best of Everything'' (the 1950's movie about young women in Manhattan with pathetic publishing jobs and dastardly boyfriends), runaway mothers, Tourette's syndrome, erotic strangulation and the art of repotting houseplants. Strangely enough, most of it works. The play is a little taken with its own cleverness at times and never coheres into an overall lesson or view, but there are plenty of laughs and thought-provoking lines along the way.,Opening a scene with sexual moaning and a couple in bed in the dark hasn't seemed daring or clever since Stephen Sondheim's ''Company'' 29 years ago; Mr. Willett's script does it several times. But at least he treats it as a running gag.,That the characters in ''Triptych'' seem complex even when their behavior is a little over the top is a tribute to Eliza Beckwith's direction. Patricia Randell is particularly good as Rosemary, the woman whom Carey (Bill Dobbins), the New Age half of the gay male couple, has an affair with. ''I'm sorry,'' says Rosemary after throwing a glass of cheap white wine in Carey's face. ''I'm working something out.'',Later she explains why she's hesitant about forging a relationship with a gay man: ''I mean the guys who like women are hateful enough.'',Bernard (Charles Loffredo), Carey's ex-boyfriend, and Dennis (Joseph Jude Zito), the liquor salesman who whisks him away to the suburbs and a new identity as Bernice (think June Cleaver played by Joan Crawford, with a martini cart), have something to say about gender roles. Dennis wants to live with a traditional, feminine 50's ''wife'' because, as he observes, with contemporary women concentrating on their own strength and independence, it seems that ''everybody now is supposed to be a man.'',But, as Bernard-Bernice discovers well into the relationship, nothing is that simple: ''I never knew being female could be so aggressive.'',The 1930's nude-photograph plot, which involves modesty, shame and sexual trauma, makes an interesting contrast to the physical abandon of the 1970's (Carey's childhood) and the intense self-examination of the 1990's.,Plays like this could make an audience wonder: Are we really up to figuring out this whole gender thing in our lifetime?,''Triptych,'' which contains brief scenes of full frontal nudity, continues at the Home Grown Theater through Monday.,TRIPTYCH,By Richard Willett; directed by Eliza Beckwith; producer, Will Siss; lighting by Beth Turomsha; sets by Kenichi Toki; sound by Ian P.

"Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.,+ means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth last weekend for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.,Broadway,*+ ''THE BEAUTY QUEEN OF LEENANE.'' The English-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh has come up with something exotic in today's world of self-conscious, style-obsessed theater: a proper, perfectly plotted drama that sets out above all to tell a story as convincingly and disarmingly as possible. This work is on many levels an old-fashioned, well-made play. Yet it feels more immediate and vital than any new drama in many seasons. The basic plot sounds familiar, like a bucolic cousin to ''The Heiress'': a plain middle-aged woman, trapped in a life as a caretaker for her infirm but iron-willed mother in rural Ireland, is offered a last chance at love. But Mr. McDonagh and the director, Garry Hines, are masterly at building up and subverting expectations in a cat-and-mouse game with the audience. There's not a single hole in the play's structural or emotional logic, yet it constantly surprises. And even as the plot grips and holds you, the performances engage you on a darker, deeper level (2:10). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $25 to $60 (Ben Brantley).,* ''DEATH OF A SALESMAN.'' In the harrowing half-century anniversary revival of Arthur Miller's masterwork, you walk right into the mind of its decimated hero, played with majestic, unnerving transparency by Brian Dennehy. Robert Falls's shadow-shrouded, powerhouse staging never looks down on Mr. Miller's deluded Brooklyn dreamer or looks ennoblingly up to him as a martyr to a success-driven country. Instead, it demands that you experience Willy's suffering without sociological distance, that you surrender to the sense of one man's pain. Yes, there's no avoiding the clunky speechifying and symbolism. But this interpretation is, above all, committed to the work's tragic, conflicted familial love story. Even as it expertly conjures Willy's grimly distorted world view, the production lets us see clearly his effect on those around him. Led superbly by Elizabeth Franz, who redefines the role of Linda Loman, and Kevin Anderson, as Willy's rudderless elder son, those people express, in highly personalized portraits, the genuine pity and terror given more abstract voice by the choruses of Greek tragedy. (3:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 rush tickets may be available the day of show (Brantley).,*+ ''ELECTRA.'' The foul deeds of ''Electra'' may have been recorded nearly two and a half millenniums ago, but in this masterly modern-dress version, they are as raw as the lead item off the police blotter. The portrait of a family convulsed by violence and betrayal is so potent and harrowing, it leaves you dazed and weirdly giddy. A daughter plots murder; a mother is butchered; a son is up to his elbows in blood. And you couldn't be more delighted. With the astounding Zoe Wanamaker in the title role, giving the proverbial performance of her career, this ''Electra'' is the most significant restaging of a classic on Broadway since the revisionist ''Doll's House'' with Janet McTeer. It's a provocative evening that re-acquaints you with the potent, unprocessed power of Greek drama; you're swept along by the narrative, majestic in its directness and simplicity (1:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $35 and $60; student rush tickets available on day of show, $20 (Peter Marks).,+ ''YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN.'' Translating the neurotic, philosophizing children of the long-running ''Peanuts'' comic strip into flesh and blood would seem to be impossible. Nonetheless this transformation is said to have occurred blissfully when Clark Gesner's musical revue ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' opened Off Broadway in 1967. ''Almost everything works,'' wrote the critic Walter Kerr, ''because almost everything is effortless.'' Effortless, alas, is exactly what the new Broadway version, directed by Michael Mayer, is not. ''Charlie Brown'' was created for an intimate space. This revised version, with additional songs by Andrew Lippa, generates an uneasy feeling of dead air that the adult actors, led by a miscast Anthony Rapp in the title role, must work way too hard to fill. Songs conceived as droll, low-key character portraits have been reinvented as show stoppers, and the numbers' winsome little bodies just aren't up to it. The best reason for adults to see this show is Kristin Chenoweth who, as Charlie Brown's sister, Sally, finds a mega-volt show-business energy in one little girl's frustrations with life (2:00). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Sundays at 1 and 5:30 P.M. Tickets: $30 to $75 (Brantley).,Off Broadway,* ''ASHES TO ASHES.'' If you doubt that there's still major theatrical life to be derived from Harold Pinter's version of Woman as Sphinx, you need only see Lindsay Duncan's quiet, shattering performance in this exquisitely mounted production, directed by Karel Reisz. Though the show is already notorious for being only 40 minutes long, connoisseurs of acting will surely find sustenance and savor in the clouded radiance of Ms. Duncan's portrait of a mysteriously damaged woman. ''Ashes to Ashes,'' a domestic dialogue that mixes the cryptic psychodrama of ''Old Times'' with the political outrage of Mr. Pinter's plays of the 1980's, recycles elements from the dramatist's earlier, fuller works in ways that sometimes shade into self-parody. And the usually excellent David Straithairn, as Ms. Duncan's husband, definitely falters here. But Ms. Duncan keeps pulling out fresh, suggestive layers of meaning from the merest flickers of expression, bringing emotional clarity to the shifting darkness of Pinter Land. (40 minutes). Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23d Street, (212) 777-4900. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 P.M.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 P.M. Tickets: $48; $24 student rush tickets may be available on the day of the performance (Brantley).,* ''BEAUTIFUL THING.'' The generosity of spirit abundantly evident in Jonathan Harvey's script, and the well-matched, down-to-earth performances by Matt Stinton and Daniel Eric Gold are the principal assets of this endearing, lopsided smile of a British comedy about a boy who falls for the boy next door. The production is not without shortcomings, particularly in the attempt to render realistically, a la Mike Leigh, a slice of London life among the hard-pressed and depressed. Yet despite some distractions, ''Beautiful Thing'' is worth your attention, because even when Gary Griffin's direction falters, Mr. Harvey's characters hold their own. The offbeat love story unfolds so authoritatively, and in such sweet fits and funny starts, that you quickly grow comfortable in the young men's world. And more than that, the young men at the center of the story are teen-agers you're happy to root for (2:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 and 7 P.M. Tickets: $45 to $47.50 (Marks).,*+ ''KILLER JOE.'' A terrifically tasty potboiler by Tracy Letts about a homicidal low-rent family with short tempers and even shorter attention spans. The material could easily register as white-trash Gothic with a comic-book spin, a sort of ''Tobacco Road'' according to Wes Craven. Yet while ''Killer Joe'' is often deeply funny, it is cheap in neither its humor nor its shock effects. This is partly because Mr. Letts's Texas trailer-park dialogue sounds so natural. The characters seldom invite your sympathy in any traditional way, but they're compulsively watchable. Directed with wit and authority by Wilson Milam, ''Killer Joe'' has the enjoyable hairpin turns of the standard mystery thriller. But it's the skewed, shifting relationships that keep you hooked. The new cast includes Fairuza Balk, Paul Dillon and Jan Leslie Harding (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 5. Tickets: $47.50 (Brantley).,*+ ''JAMES NAUGHTON: STREET OF DREAMS.'' Mr. Naughton is a gifted pop-jazz  crooner in a tradition that includes Bing Crosby, Johnny Hartman and Joe Williams. He is  also a polished after-dinner raconteur. And in ''Street of Dreams,'' an elaboration of the cabaret act he introduced last June at the Manhattan Theater Club, he spins music and storytelling into a seamless, entertaining evening. Backed by a first-rate pop-quintet, he  saunters confidently through material that ranges from ''Star Dust'' to ''Are You Lonesome Tonight?'' (in tribute to Elvis Presley) to two Randy Newman dramatic monologues.  What's missing is a certain vulnerability. No matter how impassioned the song, Mr.  Naughton maintains a suave, studied distance from his material (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays, 2 and 8 P.M.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets: $50 (Stephen Holden).,Last Chance,*+ ''COLLECTED STORIES.'' Watching the great Uta Hagen in Donald Margulies's two-character play about a venerable fiction writer and her too-eager disciple, you don't experience that self-conscious feeling that often arises in the presence of living legends. At 79, Ms. Hagen invests her role with the concentrated focus and energy of a rising young star in a make-or-break performance. The play is a lesser effort from the author of such fine, probing works as ''Sight Unseen'' and ''The Model Apartment,'' and, in the maestro's hands of Ms. Hagen, the effect can suggest a 150-watt bulb screwed into a small reading lamp. Still, one happily takes Ms. Hagen wherever one finds her. And under William Carden's direction, she and her talented young co-star, Lorca Simons, provide an intensity and conviction that burn right through the clunkier dialogue. It is, finally, impossible not to be moved (2:15). Through Sunday. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets: $37.50 and $49.50 (Brantley).,+ ''PARADE.'' Solemn, high-reaching and dreary. Inspired by the story of Leo Frank, a Jewish man who was lynched in Marietta, Ga., in 1915 for the murder of a 13-year-old girl, this musical provides a painstakingly rendered chart of the wheels of injustice. And it never lets up in its insistence on the innocence of its protagonist and the moral blindness and corruption of his persecutors. That the result is often more lectern-thumping screed than compelling story is in itself a heartbreaker. ''Parade'' is a show of promising scope and aspiration, assembled by an imposing team: the playwright Alfred Uhry, the young composer Jason Robert Brown and the titanic director Harold Prince. The play features the fine Brent Carver as Leo and Carolee Carmello, in an emotionally rich performance, as his wife. But the evening gives off the iconic, two-dimensional qualities of a religious mural, and everybody seems claustrophobically trapped within. Even Mr. Brown's songs keep you at an intellectual remove, while seemingly whispering ''J'accuse'' with every knell-like chord (2:40). Through Sunday. Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets: $50 to $75 (Brantley).,Long-Running: Broadway,Here are summaries of Ben Brantley's and Peter Marks's theater reviews:,* ''RENT.'' This landmark rock musical about love and death East Village style seems to have benefited from the inevitable cast changes. A sentimental triumph of a show  (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M.; Sundays at 2 and 7 P.M. Tickets: $35 to $80; $20 tickets by lottery on the day of the show at the box office.,* ''STOMP.'' Though it recently celebrated its 2,000th performance, this wildly creative percussive show, danced to the music of clanging bric-a-brac you find in your garage, is as crisp and exuberant as if it had opened yesterday. The performers remain an exhilarating precision marching band of working stiffs (1:30). Orpheum Theater, 126 Second Avenue, near Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 477-2477. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 P.M.; Saturdays at 7 and 10:30 P.M.; Sundays at 3 and 7 P.M.

"After two days of testimony from psychologists, law-enforcement officials and the killer's weeping father, an East Texas jury decided today that the world would be better off without John William King in it.,The seven men and five women on the jury -- its sole black member, a corrections officer, as foreman -- decided in just under three hours that Mr. King, a white supremacist, should die by lethal injection for the murder last year of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man whose body was torn to pieces when he was dragged behind a pickup truck down a rough rural road in the pine woods east of Jasper.,''Any prosecutor who enjoys getting a death penalty has just got something wrong,'' said District Attorney Guy James Gray. ''You temper your enthusiasm. But I am proud that my community stood up and did what was right.'',On his way out of the 110-year-old courthouse, where reporters and several dozen onlookers awaited the decision on the lawn, Mr. King was jeered by some, with taunts of, ''Bye-bye!'' and, ''Rot in hell!'' Asked if he had anything to say to the Byrd family, Mr. King smirked and responded with an obscenity.,''I wouldn't expect him to say God bless the Byrd family,'' said Mary Verrette, one of the murdered man's sisters. ''It just sums up the total personality of this young man.'',After voting on Tuesday to convict Mr. King of capital murder, the jurors had only two choices today: death or life imprisonment. Under a life sentence, Mr. King, 24, could have been eligible for parole in 40 years.,Only one white man has ever been executed in Texas for killing a black person: a farmer who killed another white farmer's favorite slave in the 1850's.,In voting for the death penalty in the Byrd case, in which two other men have yet to be tried, the jury today rejected defense arguments that Mr. King would not pose a threat to society if given life in prison and that the virulent racism that led him to the murder was caused by the conditions in Texas prisons, where he served a two-year sentence for burglary in the mid-1990's.,The jury decided that the evidence was too strong that Mr. King committed the murder and was unrepentant. The foreman, Joe Collins, said the jurors had used the written instructions issued by Judge Joe Bob Golden of State District Court to guide them, step by step, through their deliberations. Each of the four times the judge's instructions told them they needed to make a decision about the facts, they talked it out and then voted, until finally they were left with the ultimate votes of whether to convict and how to punish.,Every one of the votes, Mr. Collins said, was unanimous on the first try.,''The evidence was overwhelming,'' Mr. Collins said.,The decisive factor in voting for the death penalty, he added, was an eight-inch homemade knife that Jasper jail officials recently found in Mr. King's cell.,''Obviously, the man still had a lot of hatred in his mind,'' Mr. Collins said.,Karen Flowers, another juror, said: ''He showed no signs of remorse for his actions. It's so terribly sad. When I first came here, I kept looking at him, how young and handsome he is. I have a son about the same age. I wanted to find something to save him.'',In the end, Ms. Flowers said, she could not.,Sheriff Billy Rowles of Jasper County said Mr. King had a rough night in jail before today's decision. ''He was cussing and throwing things around,'' Sheriff Rowles said. ''I think probably reality hit him sometime in the last 24 to 36 hours.'',Mr. King, usually a talkative prisoner, was moody and silent today on the way to the county courthouse.,''He was not a happy camper this morning,'' Sheriff Rowles said.,On Wednesday, when Mr. King's father tearfully begged the jury to spare his son's life, Mr. King had asked to be taken out of the courtroom. He returned after his father's testimony with red, swollen eyes.,''That was a sign of humanity,'' Ms. Flowers said. ''It was the first we had seen.'',Mr. King was hustled out of town immediately after the sentence was announced, and by early afternoon was already at the James Byrd Diagnostics Unit -- named for a former warden, unrelated to the murdered man -- in Huntsville. From there, he will join 451 other Texas prisoners on the state's death row.,Prosecutors said that Mr. King, an avowed white supremacist whose arms and torso are covered with racist tattoos, had killed Mr. Byrd, whom he did not know, after picking him up after midnight on June 7, 1998. With Mr. King, prosecutors said, were two other white men, Lawrence Brewer, 31, whom Mr. King met in prison, and Shawn Berry, 23, whom Mr. King has known since high school. Trial dates for the other two have not yet been set.,Mr. King, who had joined a racist group called the Confederate Knights of America while in prison, had written his own constitution and bylaws for a chapter he hoped to start in Jasper, to be called the Texas Rebel Soldiers. The murder of Mr. Byrd, prosecutors said, was to bind the three white men together and to gain enough notoriety to attract more members to their group.,The trio picked up Mr. Byrd, who was walking home from a party and was partially intoxicated, and drove him to a remote area east of town, where he was beaten, chained around his ankles and dragged behind Mr. Berry's pickup truck for about three miles, prosecutors said.,A pathologist testified that Mr. Byrd had been alive and probably conscious until he hit a roadside culvert that sheared his body in two.,The elder Mr. King had been present for all of his son's trial, but decided he was not up to staying to hear the sentence today. Instead, early this morning, the father and son were allowed a moment together in the courthouse. The Rev. Ron Foshage, pastor of St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church in Jasper, accompanied the father to the meeting but stayed out of earshot.,He said the father and son embraced and talked quietly together for a few moments.,''I think both of them know it was probably the last time they would have physical contact with each other,'' Father Foshage said.,After the death sentence was announced, Father Foshage read a statement from the elder Mr. King.,''Please pray for the Byrd family, who have endured unimaginable pain and loss,'' he read. ''Please pray for these jurors, who have shouldered a terrible burden. Please pray for our town of Jasper, a community that remains strong though scarred by this unspeakable act.'',The younger Mr. King also left a written statement behind as he was taken away to prison. Neatly written on lined paper and handed to his lawyers, it read:,''Though I remain adamant about my innocence, it's been obvious from the beginning that this community would get what they desire; so I'll close with the words of Francis Yockey: ''The promise of success is with the man who is determined to die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly.'

"A New Jersey teamsters local once ruled by the mob through fear and violence was released from a 13-year Federal trusteeship yesterday after the Government stipulated that the union had broken the racketeers' hold, elected independent new leaders and replaced its culture of corruption with a nascent democracy.,In a ruling that Government and union officials hailed as historic, Judge Harold A. Ackerman of Federal District Court in Newark lifted the trusteeship imposed in 1986, when Teamsters Local 560 was run by mobsters of the Genovese crime family who had looted pension and welfare funds, made a mockery of union meetings and elections and crushed members' dissent with threats and reprisals.,For a union that had once been a plaything of Anthony Provenzano, a Mafia don convicted of murder and extortion, who died in prison in 1988 and has been linked to the 1975 death of the teamster president James R. Hoffa, the decision signaled a new beginning of self-government, open meetings and free elections.,And it seemed to reaffirm a Government strategy that, after years of all but ineffectual prosecutions of individual mobsters, has decimated organized crime ranks and cut their grip on unions and businesses in the last decade by using racketeering laws and trusteeships to reform the leadership and cultures of corrupt enterprises.,''It's a very gratifying moment,'' said Pete Brown, a onetime truck driver and the leader of a reform movement who was elected in December as president of Local 560, which represents 4,400 truck drivers, warehouse workers and factory employees at many businesses.,As his members celebrated at union headquarters in Union City, Mr. Brown noted with irony that James R. Hoffa Jr., recently elected to his father's old job as president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, would swear him in on March 19. ''This is the local they know is responsible for his father's death,'' Mr. Brown said, ''so that in itself will be an historic moment.'',While ending the monitoring and investigative role of Edwin H. Stier, the trustee, Judge Ackerman did not free the local from all oversight. He directed it to name Mr. Stier a trustee of its $550 million pension and welfare funds, ordered its leaders to avoid organized crime associations and continued the court's jurisdiction for four more years to insure that reforms are maintained.,But for practical purposes, the judge -- acting on the recommendation of Mr. Stier and the United States Justice and Labor Departments and Federal and state investigators -- acknowledged that Local 560, once one of the most corrupt labor unions in the country and the first to be placed under a Federal trustee, had finally been turned around and was strong enough to resist new mob intrusions.,''It is clear that Local 560 has freed itself from its corrupt past,'' Mr. Stier told Judge Ackerman. After years of struggle to oust mob associates and clean up the union, he said, the last crucial step was taken in December with the election of a slate led by Mr. Brown -- the first union vote in a decade.,Mr. Brown and others on the local's seven-member executive board, Mr. Stier said, had demonstrated ''the integrity, ability and membership support to build an honest, effective union of which all its members can be justly proud.'',Recounting the sordid history of Local 560 in court and in an interview later, Mr. Stier said the union had been dominated for 25 years by mobsters, especially by Mr. Provenzano, known as Tony Pro, whose portrait hung in the union hall long after he was dead.,Under Mr. Provenzano and his associates and successors, union members who dared to question the leaders were intimidated into silence by violence and reprisals, jobs went to those who played along and dissenters were shut out. Pension and welfare funds dwindled, apparently looted or waywardly invested.,By 1986, Mr. Stier said, ''Local 560 was the most thoroughly corrupt union in the country,'' and it was the first to be placed under a trusteeship by the Federal court. Mr. Stier, who had been a Federal prosecutor and New Jersey's first director of criminal justice with a mandate to fight organized crime, was appointed trustee in 1987, with complete authority over the union.,For 18 months, he and an associate, Frank Jackiewicz, a retiring teamster official, superseded the union's leadership and ran Local 560 themselves, negotiating contracts, processing grievances and even leading strikes and walking picket lines.,While mob elements were then still strong in the local, Mr. Stier said he was never threatened with physical harm, though there were many verbal bouts and tense confrontations. He reinvested the pension and welfare funds, established contract negotiating committees, a union newspaper and an open-door policy so members could bring problems directly to him.,He also encouraged participation by dissenters and investigated what he called the heirs of the mob legacy, including Michael Sciarra, who was later barred from running for union office and subsequently expelled from the union after he was found to have associated with Genovese crime family members.,By late 1988, he said, he had begun to make progress, with many members realizing that they had been exploited under the old regime. He decided to let members elect new leaders. ''I felt it was the only way we could wean the union away from dependence on a trustee,'' he said.,For the first time, he recalled, vigorous campaigns were run, and members began to discuss the organized crime history of their local. ''A fragile but healthy democratic atmosphere had been established,'' he said. While Michael Sciarra was barred from running for the presidency, his brother, Daniel, was elected, Mr. Stier said.,Over the next decade, Mr. Stier closely monitored the union leadership's conduct and associations, and gradually forced Daniel Sciarra and others out of power, using turnovers and appointments on the executive board to change its composition in favor of independent leaders.,Two years ago, Mr. Brown was appointed president of the local, and Mr. Stier, who had watched him rise through the ranks, was delighted.,''He was the first president to begin to develop a real political following within the local -- it was clear that the shop stewards and members were looking to him for responsible leadership,'' Mr. Stier said.,Mr. Brown's reform slate won 55 percent of the vote in the recent election, and local members like James Cirillo, 52, of Wallington, N.J., a teamster for 35 years, were awed. ''Elected officials!'' he said yesterday.,Like many, Tony Valdner, 54, of Bayonne, a local member for 25 years, had distrusted the trusteeship, but changed his mind. ''They were the Government, taking over a private enterprise,'' he said. ''I knew there were problems, but I thought it should have been up to the union to solve them. But I'll tell you something. Boy, was I wrong. If it wasn't for the Government, this local union would be nonexistent today.''",ROBERT D.

"My Favorite Martian,Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels, Elizabeth Hurley, Daryl Hannah, Wallace Shawn,Directed by Donald Petrie,PG  88 minutes,On day No. 85 of a Mars probe, the camera aboard a mini-golf cart peters out one boulder short of revealing a big, jumping city. Yes, there is life on the red planet, though still unbeknownst to everybody on Earth.,Back in California, a space shuttle blasts off with the remains of Jerry Garcia. Headed our way is an unidentified flying object. ''Scramble the F-16's!'' cries a dispatcher in Mr. Petrie's moderately diverting update of the 60's CBS sitcom.,The incoming craft buries itself in a deserted stretch of beach. The only witness is a dumbfounded television reporter named O'Hara (Mr. Daniels), who fails to notice that a three-eyed Martian has circled behind him and hopped in the trunk of his car.,At O'Hara's place, the Martian transforms into the human Uncle Martin (Mr. Lloyd), an enthusiastic and rather urbane fellow of about 60 with a great build for a man his age and a wildly excited expression that reminds one of Mr. Lloyd's Doc Brown in the ''Back to the Future'' movies. At certain junctures, however, Martin reverts to his Martian appearance, which is both upsetting and thrilling to O'Hara.,Very gradually the two get to know each other. But there's trouble. The Government is on to Martin the Martian and so is Brace Channing (Ms. Hurley), a dim but manically ambitious rival of O'Hara's. And if Martin doesn't get his space ship fixed, it will self-destruct and strand him forever.,When Martians get depressed, they fall apart physically, trailing red body parts like leavings from a lobster dinner. Here's hoping that the alternator Martin appropriates from O'Hara's car gets him back up and planet-hopping.,VIOLENCE The Government's main man (Mr. Shawn) threatens to spray gunfire and there is other rough stuff, but it is mild and comic.,SEX Nothing happens, but Brace Channing turns up the innuendo to hot and heavy.,PROFANITY None.,For Which Children?,AGES 3-5 They're awfully young, but there's nothing too untoward and many children will get enough of the gist to follow along.,AGES 6-10 Bull's-eye.

Kennedy's speech regarding Soviet missiles in Cuba sends Calvin Webber (Mr. Walken), a very mad scientist, and his wife, Helen (Ms. Spacek), pregnant and hugging a warm pot roast, diving for the elaborate fallout shelter Calvin has prepared for just such an occasion.,Moments after the steel doors have closed over them, a plane accidentally crashes into their house. Hearing an explosion above them, Calvin is convinced of the worst: to survive the radiation, they must remain entombed for 35 years.,It could be worse. Little Adam (who grows up to be Mr. Fraser) is a healthy, obedient child fed a steady diet of his parents' 50's gee-whiz pluck and amiability. The shelter looks much like home and is equipped like a small town. While Helen turns to drink and retires for private screaming sessions, she carries on nobly. Calvin stays Calvin, puttering with shelter mechanical systems and imbuing true-blue values in his son.,And then comes liberation. Outside lies a world that to them is as alarming as if they popped out into a civilization of atomic mutants. Their immaculate backyard is now an adult book store in a blasted-out part of town whose crazed inhabitants immediately start a cult at the sight of Calvin in a gas mask.,By now Adam is a handsome, excruciatingly pleasant young man. Not unreasonably, he wants a girl and soon encounters Eve (Ms. Silverstone), a cynical but decent young woman ever on the rebound from her latest rotten relationship. At first the riotously out-of-date Adam puzzles Eve and everybody else with his thunderstruck reactions to his surroundings and outlandish explanations of his origins. Can she come to terms with a man from a hole in the ground?,VIOLENCE Dad taught Adam to use his fists (a 50's skill), and he does so briefly to discourage an abusive former boyfriend of Eve's.,SEX None is performed, but there is a lot of talk about sex.,PROFANITY Quite a bit.,For Which Children?,AGES 3-9 Not for them.,AGES 10-12 This is a catchy story with appealing characters and, on balance, nothing very harmful.,AGES 13 AND UP This is a film for teen-agers.,October Sky,Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, William Lee Scott, Chris Owen, Chad Lindberg, Natalie Canerday, Laura Dern,Directed by Joe Johnston,PG  100 minutes,In the straight-shooting 50's, Sputnik flashes across the sky above a West Virginia coal mining town and a high school boy named Homer Hickham determines to build a rocket of his own, only smaller and more along the lines of something you'd present at a science fair.,Homer is a glowingly earnest lad, but his plan puts off his stern father (Mr. Cooper), a hidebound mine foreman who feels the boy belongs down a shaft with his nose to the coal seam. Fortunately, Homer has a supportive science teacher (Ms. Dern), cooperative school friends and some sympathetic experts on metals and welding at the mine to help him build an increasingly advanced series of baby rockets.,Everybody is impressed except, of course, Homer's dad. Eventually, though, the man (who is the film's most interesting character) gives resigned approval. From there it's on to the science fair circuit, where Homer wins prizes, presses the flesh with the rocket scientist Werner Von Braun, and readies for a career in the NASA space program.,VIOLENCE Men are carried off after mine mishaps, but nothing is graphic.,SEX None.,PROFANITY None.,FOOTNOTE It may sound a little too feel-good, but the film is based on a true story, and there are clips from home movies of the real-life characters to prove it.,For Which Children?,AGES 3-5 Like the rockets, the story will pass over the heads of most little ones.,AGES 6-10 This is a good age.,AGES 11 AND UP Set in a simpler era, the movie is unfortunately quite a bit too simple for most older children.",PETER M.

"The citizens of this graceful but impoverished city have a message for the West: Hand over your money, or we'll shoot.,Just a decade ago, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, Lviv was a prime supplier of Moscow's tanks, bombsights and military electronics. When the Soviet Union vanished, so did Lviv's weapons orders, scores of thousands of factory jobs -- and then, bit by bit, the city's hope for a capitalist future.,The question now, says its young Mayor, Vasyl Kuybida, is whether the capitalists want to do anything about it. And what Lviv will do if the West does not help out in converting factories to nonmilitary production.,''Either we find international sources to finance the conversion of these factories,'' Mr. Kuybida said in an interview this month, ''or we'll be forced to return to arms production on the level of France, Germany, Great Britain and so on.'',''There are not moral standards just for us,'' he said.,Whether bluff or threat, that captures a gnawing worry among some political leaders and intellectuals here that Ukraine's best opportunity to fix itself firmly in Europe -- maybe its last for a long time -- is in danger of slipping away.,The trappings of a Western democracy are all in place. Ukraine can hold free elections with the best of them, and its leaders say they are committed to laissez-faire capitalism and enlightened self-rule. But too often, it is a shell concealing an Eurasian core. Outsiders say the bureaucracy still shows its Soviet genealogy. Communist legislators block the most crucial reforms. The basket-case economy remains lashed to its Russian past, and the longer it stays there, the tighter the bind becomes.,How tight could be decided as soon as October, when Ukraine will hold its third presidential election since independence in 1991. With eight months to go, the pro-European incumbent, Leonid Kuchma, is in trouble, unable so far to raise living standards and unwilling, by some accounts, to uproot endemic official corruption.,More tellingly, he has largely failed to overhaul Ukraine's Soviet-era economy. Major industries remain under state control, and land has still to be privatized. Few companies have looked beyond Moscow either for raw materials or for customers -- 60 percent have business ties with Russian companies -- and so Russia's crash in August stopped Ukraine's economy cold. In fact, it may add two more years of recession to the three Ukraine already has endured.,For a nation still spending comparatively huge sums to address the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster almost 13 years ago, the economic problems are backbreaking. Fiscal experts say the country will be hard pressed to pay its foreign debt this year.,As in Russia, the Government has deferred some pensions and salaries to workers at state-owned industries. The citizens have usually been stoic, but not always. Recently, one unpaid coal miner died when he set himself afire in protest. A half-dozen other miners slit their wrists, but survived.,The fault is not all Mr. Kuchma's. Ukraine's 450-member Parliament, a fistfight-prone body with a corruption problem, is swayed by current and former Communists who have blocked land privatization and an overhaul of the crippling tax system. But the President is getting the blame. And were the election held tomorrow, many analysts say, voters might dump him for a candidate from the Socialist and Communist left.,Most Leftists Favor Closer Ties With Russia,A leading contender, they say, would be Oleksandr O. Moroz, a Socialist Party leader seen by many as the least radical of the leftist candidates.,If voters feel the same way this fall, it could change the course of Ukraine's young democracy. Most leftists favor still closer political and economic ties with Russia. And more are warming to the notion that Ukraine should join an emerging alliance between Russia and their mutual neighbor Belarus, where power is in the hands of an eccentric Soviet-style dictator.,''It all depends on whether the West has any strategy,'' said Vira Manivska, who heads the International Center for Policy Studies, a Kiev group dedicated to improving Ukrainian governance. ''If things go their own way here, I don't think we have many chances of being independent of Russia. The only thing going for us is that Russia doesn't have any strategy, either.'',Ukraine has done some things right. Its central bank handled the August crash far more deftly than Russia did, with the result that its banking system has survived largely intact and its creditors are mostly satisfied. The Government is moving to reduce taxes, a big barrier to foreign investment.,[After threatening to halve its aid because of Ukraine's lack of progress toward economic reform, the United States said on Feb. 19 that it was releasing $195 million in assistance this year, in part because the business climate had improved.],The country also boasts something no other former Soviet state has: a second freely elected President. If it is poor, Ukraine is also stable, democratic and -- for the moment, at least -- insistent on remaining sovereign.,Larger but Poorer Than Its Neighbors,Ukraine's problems cannot be ignored. Its western neighbors -- Poland, Hungary and other former Soviet satellites -- see it as the main buffer between them and an increasingly wobbly, untrustworthy Russia. Potentially, it is a formidable ally or rival. Ukraine is far larger in area than Poland and Hungary combined, its military is nearly as big as theirs, and with 50 million people, it is just as populous.,But the superlatives end at economics. The average Ukrainian earns $40 a month; a comparable Hungarian makes eight times as much. Foreign investors have sunk $2.7 billion into Ukraine during eight years of independence; in Poland, they invested three times that last year alone. In dollar terms, the average Pole produced four times as much as an average Ukrainian last year.,Poland, Hungary and the nearby Czech Republic are joining NATO in March and, almost certainly, farther down the road, the European Union. Ukraine is not even on the waiting lists.,''To adapt our military system to NATO requirements, we'd have to spend $1.7 billion a year, maybe more,'' said Oleksandr V. Razumkov, the deputy secretary of Ukraine's national security and defense council and the country's liaison to Russia. ''You have to understand that the actual budget for all Ukraine isn't more than $8 billion.'',As for membership in the European Union, ''it's not realistic for 10 or 15 years,'' he said.,How adjacent nations could take such divergent courses is as much a matter of mentality as geography. Poland has had centuries of independence in the course of its history, well before it became a Soviet satellite after World War II. When the Soviet empire crumbled, Poles knew precisely what they wanted next.,Ukraine, on the other hand, did not exist in its current borders until Stalin cut an ill-fated land-for-peace deal with Hitler in 1939. For centuries before that, it was split among empires -- the eastern half ruled by Russia's czars, the western by the Poles and the Austrians.,Eastern Ukraine, with the capital, Kiev, and most of the people, took on a Eurasian cast and, thanks to the Soviet Union, an assemblage of smoky industries. The western part became decidedly European and poor. Even now, the two halves often seem to share little beside a language.,That Ukrainians wanted their freedom was a given. But deciding what to do with it has been a problem -- all the more because their only practice in governing came at the feet of Moscow.,''For eight years this country has been unable to define its orientation,'' said Taras Steckiw, a member of Parliament from Lviv and a leader in the centrist People's Democratic Party. ''It can't last forever. Either we'll be an element of a Slavic union, or we're the forepost of Western civilization. Or we're the bridge.'',Few places feel the competing East-West tugs more acutely than Lviv, a museum-piece city of 850,000 set on the Ukrainian flatlands, just 40 miles from Poland. Ukrainian here is dappled with Polish suffixes and inflections, and the town with Gothic cathedrals, Renaissance squares and Austrian coffeehouses (the Austrians, who ruled here until 1918, called it Lemberg).,Many Factories Have Shut Down,Lviv produced Ukraine's first independence movement, in 1848, and its first independent state, Ruthenia, born at the end of World War I and subdued by Poland a few days later. Lviv spawned most of Ukraine's anti-Communist dissidents, its first anti-Communist protest, and its first modern political party. No Ukrainian city is more European or more democratic.,And few are poorer.,''How can we survive?'' asked Natasha Cedovina, a young widow with a daughter. ''There's nothing for gas, nothing for electricity. It's a circle without end.'',Ms. Cedovina was eyeing the prices in a battered one-room shop just outside Lviv, in the village of Zhorkva. Beneath a lithograph of the Virgin Mary, the store's four shelves were heavy with bottles of Slava vodka, coffee, chocolate bars, jars of pickled pigs' feet and cucumbers, most of it well beyond her budget.,The state gives her a monthly window's pension and allowance for her child that comes to $11.22. She has no job; the glass factory where she once worked shut down after Ukraine's independence.,''Which plant is operating? No plant is operating,'' she said. ''Ask us which plant hasn't closed.'',The six or seven other women in the shop nodded agreement and began to chime in. ''My child has diabetes,'' one said. ''There's no money for medicine.'',The eldest, a stout, red-faced woman missing several teeth, was plaintive. ''Can you help me get my pension?'' she asked. ''Six months I'm without a pension.'',The story in Lviv proper is much the same. By conservative estimate, 135,000 workers lost their jobs when the city's military-oriented plants became idle.,Mayor Kuybida says close to a third of all workers are unemployed, initially because the break with the Soviet Union severed business ties, but now because the factories have been unable to adjust to a market economy.,In no small part, that is Kiev's fault.,A Large Minority Is Ethnic Russian,Ukrainian experts say the Government has been hard put to change its ways because it remains saddled with Soviet-era bureaucrats and Soviet ways. And that reflects the lineage of virtually all senior officials: from President Kuchma on down, Ukraine is run largely by men from the Russified east.,Twelve million of Ukraine's citizens -- nearly a quarter -- are ethnic Russian, and most live in the east. During the Soviet era, some came to work in heavy industry; many others headed south to Ukraine for retirement, much as Americans flock to Florida.,Most of these Russians are at best indifferent to integration with the West. In fact, while it is hard to find anyone in Lviv who is not ardently pro-Western Europe and anti-Communist, no more than one in five Ukrainians say in polls that they favor turning to the West. More than that -- a third, in one poll -- favor closer ties with former Soviet states or outright reunification with Russia.,The same polls show that the strongest support for a Western-oriented Ukraine lies among young people, regardless of where they live.,''Ukraine doesn't have a generation yet,'' said Bohdan Kravchenko, a former government official who founded and heads a public-administration training institute. ''The entrepreneurial class is by and large extremely young.'',What troubles officials like Mr. Kuybida is whether Ukraine has a generation's time to waste.,With the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, ''market forces won,'' adding: ''But it just can't happen that people go to bed Communist and get up the next morning with democratic ideas. If people see for seven years that they have no job, no reform, no expectations for the future, then they'll start thinking that they made a mistake.''",MICHAEL WINES,"FEB. 26, 1999",Struggling Ukraine Teeters Between East and West,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/struggling-ukraine-teeters-between-east-and-west.html

"Investors have been paring the amount of money they put in stock mutual funds this month, after pumping $15.7 billion into the funds in January, fund companies reported yesterday.,The pace of money moving into bond and money-market funds in February has also been lower than in January, when $8.43 billion went into taxable and municipal bond funds and a record $60.8 billion poured into money-market funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry's trade association.,''We're estimating that stock fund flows were about half what they were in January,'' said Carl Wittnebert, research director at Trimtabs.com in Santa Rosa, Calif., which tracks fund flows. ''Bond funds have suffered outflows in recent days as the Treasury market slumped.'',The month of January typically has higher fund flows than February because it's the month when the highest number of 401(k) retirement plans are established. In January 1998, about $14.1 billion was invested in equity funds compared with the record $28.5 billion in January 1997.,Among fund companies, Vanguard Group, America's second biggest, said overall flows into its funds were down about 20 percent, to $6.1 billion, in February compared with a record $7.8 billion in January.,T. Rowe Price Associates, the 10th-biggest fund group in the United States, said that flows to the company's domestic stock funds were down this month and that investors continued to pull money out of international stock funds.,Among individual funds, the $19.5 billion Janus Twenty Fund was the top seller in January followed by the $79 billion Vanguard Index 500 Fund, according to the Financial Research Corporation, which monitors fund flows. The top-selling bond fund was Pimco Total Return.,Last February, the Investment Company Institute reported, $24.2 billion was invested in stock funds -- about three times what Trimtabs estimates will be invested this month.,Stock funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, like the Vanguard Index 500, and other benchmark equity indexes are increasingly becoming the investment of choice.,These days, about $360 of every $1,000 invested in stock funds is going to funds that mimic the S.& P. 500, according to Financial Research, which is based in Boston.

"The Supreme Court of New Jersey has cleared the way for a 25-year-old man to file an age discrimination suit.,On Wednesday, the court overturned a lower-court ruling that had thrown out a suit filed by Michael Sisler against Bergen Commercial Bank after he was fired as vice president of credit card operations. The lower court had said that the state's Law Against Discrimination was intended to apply only to workers age 40 or older.,In allowing Mr. Sisler's suit to proceed, the Supreme Court ruled that while the state's discrimination law was intended mainly to protect older workers who have historically been discriminated against, it is also broad enough to allow reverse age discrimination cases brought by younger employees.,''We find it entirely consistent with the underlying purposes of the Law Against Discrimination to infer that the Legislature would have intended to protect, for example, a 23-year-old schoolteacher who, despite her outstanding performance in the classroom, was discharged by a school board because they believed she was too young to teach,'' the court said in its unanimous opinion. ''Moreover, if we have mistakenly construed the legislative intent, the Legislature remains free to amend the L.A.D. to specify a minimum qualifying age for the law's protection.'',Mr. Sisler said that shortly after he accepted the job as vice president in 1994, the bank chairman took him to lunch, asked him his age and ''appeared shocked'' to learn he was only 25. About five months later, Mr. Sisler was fired after bank officials told him the position simply was not working out. He tried suing the bank, claiming that his age was the reason he was dismissed.,Angelo Genova, a lawyer representing the Bergen Commercial Bank, which is based in Paramus, said, ''This decision will only invite even more employment litigation than presently exists and will particularly invite wholesale claims for age discrimination.'',But Kevin Kiernan, a lawyer for Mr. Sisler, said it would be wrong to think that this decision would prompt a spate of new lawsuits by younger employees.,''We're not opening any floodgates,'' Mr. Kiernan said. ''This is a rare occurrence,'' he said, adding that his client was a young man with ''experience beyond his years.'',''If someone out of college goes to apply to be C.E.O. of General Motors and gets turned down, can someone seriously infer that there was an age discrimination case? I don't think so.'',The Supreme Court anticipated such criticism of its ruling.,''We note but reject expressed concerns that our holding will undermine protections for older workers and force employers to fill vacancies for high-level executive positions with unworldly 18-year-old applicants,'' the court said in its opinion.,New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination was enacted in 1945 and amended in 1962 to include age among the characteristics protected under the law. Unlike the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which limits its protections to workers who are at least 40 years of age, the state law does not spell out such age limits.,Mr. Sisler's case will now go back to State Superior Court in Bergen County for trial.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"FEB. 26, 1999","State's High Court Lets Man, 25, Sue on Age Discrimination",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/state-s-high-court-lets-man-25-sue-on-age-discrimination.html
"A half-mile stretch of open road was all that separated Serbian police forces patrolling a checkpoint and Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas staked out in the village of Studencane.,The road between was empty but for two farm tillers that the guerrillas had placed as improvised road blocks. They were the only indication of the tense standoff that has been dragging on all week and preventing villagers from coming home.,The Interior Ministry police were insisting they would resume patrols along the road to two Serbian villages beyond. The rebels, led by Comdr. Drini, one of the six zone commanders in Kosovo and who is known only by his nom de guerre, had said they would fire on any police vehicle that came through.,Commander Drini described it as a ''game of nerves.'' With tensions raised in Kosovo since peace talks in France failed to reach a final agreement, and with increased Serbian troop movements around the region, the brinkmanship was potentially lethal. It had the foreign monitors in the region, led by Brig. Gen. Michel Maisonneuve of Canada, working all night to avoid a clash.,''I was feeling pretty bad last night,'' General Maisonneuve admitted. By morning, though, he had persuaded the police to wait another day, and the rebels to let the patrols resume on Friday.,To try to return to normal the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, which oversees the monitor program, would accompany the police on Friday, he said, and the guerrillas would stay hidden from the road while the patrol passed.,In a gesture of compromise, the rebels brought out tractors to drag away their improvised defenses from the road.,Commander Drini, 38, a former officer of the Yugoslav People's Army, surrounded by some 20 guerrillas, said, ''It is a chess game, and we have to sacrifice something.'',Asked if he felt vulnerable, he said his anti-tank grenade launchers were nearby. With a glance toward the Serbian forces facing him, he said, ''I do not think they are so brave.'',The day was nevertheless a success for the international monitors who had defused the tension for another day. ''We are getting across to both sides that it is in their interests to reduce tensions during this period and bring the villagers back,'' General Maisonneuve said. Yet he warned that the situation could change quickly. ''It just takes one negligent discharge,'' he said.,Military observers are concerned about the increased movement of large numbers of Serbian troops and armor in Kosovo. Much of it appears to be exercises as the Serbian military practices evacuating bases and barracks in the event of NATO air strikes.,There has also been a buildup of troops along the southern border with Macedonia and the army is reported to have mined a bridge near the frontier. The heavy troop presence could easily block the departure from Kosovo of foreign monitors, one observer said.,It could also block the arrival of a NATO peacekeeping force for Kosovo, which would probably arrive from Macedonia, where the NATO extraction force is already based.,The greatest fear is, however, that the Serbian military is planning an offensive against the rebels and the ethnic Albanian villages under their control. The Serbian army announced it was conducting a ''live-firing exercise'' around the village of Bukos in northern Kosovo today, but a reporter who gained access said the army was firing mortars on the village.,The brinkmanship in Studencane was an illustration of how both sides are trying to inch forward to increase the area they control, while a peace settlement remains uncertain.",CARLOTTA GALL,"FEB. 26, 1999",Stamping Out Sparks Near Kosovo Powder Keg,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/stamping-out-sparks-near-kosovo-powder-keg.html
"WHERE? This is the biggest journalistic question of all, as the famous Yankees and the infamous Nets agree to agree.,The potential half owners of the Yankees are Jersey guys, whose record of social commitment leaves context clues that this just might be a good deal for the South Bronx.,The word from inside is that this is a specifically 50-50 deal, which means George Steinbrenner is going to have to learn to work well and play well with others, that old kindergarten criteria. And just where is the Yankees' sandbox going to be located after the lease runs out at Yankee Stadium in 2002?,These new owners of the Nets have kept their roots. Lewis Katz has put his money into Camden, his hometown. Ray Chambers, born in Newark, has sponsored young people in private schools and donated money to the arts. Finn Wentworth and Bill Cosby and the other new owners have shown an impulse for tying the Nets into the community.,The biggest clue about the future of the Yankees may come from the way the new owners of the Nets have talked of building an arena in the heart of Newark, as troubled as it may be.,The Nets (and Devils and Giants and Jets and MetroStars) currently play in the Meadowlands, a complex in the swamplands, still unreachable by rail transportation -- undoubtedly on purpose, to keep poor people out.,The Man From Tampa has often displayed a Sun Belter's abhorrence of the South Bronx, but political developments have caused his team to be locked there like a car caught in traffic on the Major Deegan. George couldn't get downtown because New York taxpayers would revolt against Mayor Giuliani's unfocused fantasies. George couldn't get across the river because of Governor Whitman's principled stand against spending public money on a baseball team.,Now George has been rescued from his major problem of needing instant cash. In his own overbearing way, he is a throwback, whose main business is his baseball team, a latter-day Stoneham, a latter-day Griffith. With this deal, George can settle his estate and still leave half the team to his heirs, without having to get out of baseball the way the O'Malleys did.,This is potentially a much better deal for the public than the one that was being discussed with Cablevision, until George smarted off and said he would always have control of the Yankees. As it is, there are too many sinister overlaps of television and team ownership, eh, mate? George now has credible allies in his hopes to build a new stadium. Except for building a great team, he has left precious little personal or philanthropic mark on New York.,The first assumption was that George's new pals would envision a short train ride from Manhattan or suburban New Jersey to a new stadium in Newark. They could probably even get away with calling it Yankee Stadium, given the history of the Yankees' AAA farm team, the Newark Bears, playing downtown in Ruppert Stadium when the Yankees were tromping with hobnailed boots over the American League in the 30's and 40's.,(Please don't think I'm not being overly romantic. Given baseball's alarming tropism toward luxury boxes and waiter service, for goodness' sakes, the poor people of Newark would be as hard-pressed to buy tickets as the poor people of the Bronx.),However, the proposed deal does not signify a tilt to New Jersey, insists Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations man who will be a minor partner in the deal. Rubenstein said the Yankees still have three options -- the Bronx, Midtown or New Jersey. And New Jersey could be either the Meadowlands or Newark.,This could all be a ploy to squeeze New York to build a new Yankee Stadium for the new owners. People who know development say there is enough space between the Harlem River and the immovable hills for a new stadium, parking, restaurants and shops, as well as megastores that would provide jobs.,The old Yankee Stadium could stay just where it is, a living museum, a world-level field of dreams.,With their record in New Jersey, the potential owners seem quite capable of making their own judgment that a social gesture is just as important in the South Bronx as it is in Newark. Neighborhoods are neighborhoods. People are people.,They also do not want to be known -- forever -- as arrivistes who moved the Yankees out of New York. What is most needed is vision, activism, a feel for old cities, a true sense of roots. The Yankees have needed that more than they needed Roger Clemens.",GEORGE VECSEY,"FEB. 26, 1999",Sports of The Times; Nets' Owners Could Help South Bronx,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-nets-owners-could-help-south-bronx.html
"EVERYONE wants to know what Stephon Marbury is going to do: is he going right? Going left? Will he stay put in Minnesota with the Timberwolves? Jump ship and join the Bulls' cleanup campaign? Or will the league's best young point guard submit to a trade that brings him home to New York City?,What's he going to do? Dribble or shoot?,For the last two months, he has been noncommittal. After last night's performance, which was highlighted by a shot that sent a lost game into overtime, Marbury made a comment that revealed that his interest in New York was more than a passing one.,When someone asked him about his battle last night with Charlie Ward, the Knick point guard and the player he would presumably replace, Marbury said: ''He played great tonight. If he can play like that every night, you all won't need a point guard.'' Then he added: ''But what's the chances?'',Earlier in the day, he all but said he would never end up in New York.,''There is no way that that will happen,'' he said. ''I couldn't see it.'',What about being signed by Minnesota and traded?,''They don't have anyone that Minnesota would want for me; I don't think Kevin McHale is that stupid,'' Marbury said, referring to the Timberwolves' vice president for basketball operations.,We're about to see how savvy McHale is.,Now Marbury is blossoming as a player and a commodity. This week he was named the National Basketball Association's player of the week after becoming the fifth player in league history to record at least 40 points and 10 assists in a game without a turnover. Last week he averaged 24.3 points and a league-high 11.8 assists and shot 55 percent from the field as the Timberwolves won 3 of 4 games. Minnesota is 8-3, the best start in team history. Last night Marbury's errant pass with 53 seconds left allowed the Knicks to take a lead late in the fourth quarter, but his jumper with 2.2 seconds to go in regulation sent the game into overtime. His shot at the end of overtime was blocked and Minnesota fell, 115-113.,Teams are obsessed with Marbury. The Lakers need him to break a cycle of the blind leading the blind in pursuit of a championship; the Bulls need him to clean up the mess created by cleaning house; the Knicks, in their strip-mining approach to discovering a championship, need Marbury the way a furnace needs coal.,What's best for Marbury? Chicago is a disaster waiting to happen, New York is a well-heeled trap. How many hometown heroes have done well in New York early in their careers? Bernard King came to the Knicks in midcareer and flourished. Mark Jackson began here on a high note but was traded, Rod Strickland became disgruntled and was traded.,Marbury's thoughts change as rapidly as the business. At 22, he still tries to balance the romance of the game he felt in high school with the finance of the game.,I watched Marbury on Wednesday evening when he sat courtside at the Garden watching St. John's roll to its 23d victory of the season. Marbury had a fling with college -- one season and out at Georgia Tech. He said he did not miss the college environment, preferred the honesty of the pros where the game is about money and performance and everyone knows it. What he loves about the Garden are memories that go back to Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. The Garden was the scene of two bitter setbacks  as his team lost its bid for the city championship his sophomore and junior years.,But even in defeat there was a subtle victory. In 1994 a seat-throwing melee erupted following a preliminary game on the night Lincoln played for the Public Schools Athletic League title. School officials asked Marbury, a junior, to get on the Garden's public-address system and ask for calm. After he spoke, there was no further disruption. Lincoln lost the championship, but Marbury gained a new sense of himself.,A year later Marbury scored 28 points against Paul Robeson High School and won m.v.p. honors as Lincoln won the long-sought city championship. Marbury sank to his knees, pressed his face to the hardwood and cried.,''People always ask me about the most memorable game I've ever played in,'' he said. ''I always say the city championship games. People say, 'Well, what about the Bulls?' But there really is no comparison. To grow up here and to play in the city. You have to live in the city and play in the P.S.A.L. to understand it.'',He grew up a Knicks fan. Last year he suggested that his desire to be a Knick had as much to do with fulfilling a childhood dream as it had to do with money. Back then he complained about the Minnesota winters, the deserted streets of downtown Minneapolis. Back then he said: ''Me thinking about playing for the Knicks isn't a fantasy. That's reality.'',Yesterday he hinted that he had loosened his grip on childhood dreams. ''By me getting older, I'm just getting adjusted to Minnesota, it's starting to become part of my life,'' Marbury said. ''I'm starting to see that it's more like a business. When I finally realized that it was a business, I looked at my options and said to myself, 'I'm working right now and I have my free time in the summers.' I'm able to look at Minnesota totally different.'',But his post-game comments about Ward and about New York City suggest that he is still looking at the city where he grew up. ''I love New York,'' he said. ''There's no place like New York. This is my home.'',Someone suggested that he might be better off staying away from New York, growing up away from home where mistakes would be less public, less of a weight. Marbury brushed that aside.,''I've been walking with the world on my shoulders since I was a little kid,'' he said. ''It won't make a difference to me now.'',Everyone wants to know what Stephon Marbury is going to do. Dribble or shoot?",WILLIAM C. RHODEN,"FEB. 26, 1999","Sports of The Times; Marbury a Knick?

"MICHAEL JORDAN'S number, 23, is on his golf bag. And when Shigeki Maruyama was in Chicago two years ago, he shopped at the Michael Jordan store.,The cheerful Japanese golfer called it one of his happiest moments. ''I bought my shoes and clothing and I ate a cheeseburger there,'' he said through an interpreter. ''It was delicious.'',Did you get to meet Jordan?,''No, I have never met him,'' he said, ''but I am desperate to meet him.'',So why is Jordan's number on your golf bag?,''When I became a pro, I was 23,'' said Maruyama, now 29. And, he noted, Jordan also turned pro in his early 20's.,''So I really feel close when I hear about him and his interviews,'' he said. ''I really feel close to him because of the different reasons.'',How many strokes would you give Jordan in golf? ''Handicap?'' he said. ''Half, 5. Total, 10.'',And as the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship moved into today's third round, Loren Roberts might wish he could get a stroke or two from Maruyama, who had six birdies yesterday in a 4-and-2 elimination of Justin Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion.,''Shigeki's the best player in Japan and he's played great all over the world,'' Leonard said later. ''So it would be hard to call what happened an upset.'',Maruyama, who is 5 feet 7 inches and 185 pounds, burst into the golf world's consciousness two months ago in the Presidents Cup in Australia, winning all five of his matches for the International team, including a 3-and-2 triumph over John Huston in the singles.,As No. 42 in the world golf ranking, Maruyama easily qualified for this first of three World Golf Championship events this year.,''Everybody is checking the rankings,'' Davis Love 3d, who was No. 4, said not long ago, ''to see who's going to draw Maruyama.'',As it turned out, Steve Stricker, No. 23, drew Maruyama and lost, 3 and 2, in Wednesday's opening round before Leonard, who is No. 10, lost yesterday.,Of the world's top 10 ranked players, only Tiger Woods, No. 1, is among the 16 survivors after the departure of David Duval, Vijay Singh, Nick Price and Leonard yesterday. If Maruyama were to defeat Roberts, No. 30, this morning and then the Bill Glasson-Andrew Magee winner in the afternoon, he suddenly would be in tomorrow's semifinals.,''I used to play match play a lot when I was in the university, and also when I became a pro,'' he said. ''I won the Japan Match Play. I have lots of confidence. I really love match play.'',Why? ''Two points,'' he said. ''The first is, I can focus, just one person, instead of worrying about the whole big tournament. It is just concentrating, fighting with one person, and I like that concentration.,''The other is, in each hole, the result comes up right away. So, when I make a mistake or something, I can just switch into gearing up for the next hole and I can change my mood and just keep going playing.'',What would it mean if he were to win a tournament in the United States?,''It would mean a lot to me,'' he said, ''because the reason I wanted to become a pro is when I saw Tom Watson winning the Masters in 1981, and it just has that much closer meaning to me and how I decided to become a pro.'',How recognized is Maruyama in Japan?,''A lot more Japanese people are interested in baseball than in golf,'' he said. ''So unless I win really big-time, it is not going to mean that much. I don't really care how I am going to be recognized in Japan. At this point, it really means a lot to me and my self-esteem.'',But considering his success, should the American golf pros fear Maruyama?,''No problem,'' he said. ''I want everyone to think I am a really funny guy.''",DAVE ANDERSON,"FEB. 26, 1999",Sports of The Times; A Master of Match Play With Jordan's Number,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-a-master-of-match-play-with-jordan-s-number.html
"The Yugoslav Army has massed 4,500 heavily armored troops on the Kosovo border, the Pentagon said today, threatening to undermine the fragile progress toward ending the conflict there and challenging Washington to enforce an agreement that limits Yugoslav forces in the rebellious province.,Serbian commanders have also moved 60 tanks, 50 armored personnel carriers and 70 artillery pieces to the Kosovo frontier, in positions that would allow a major assault on rebel fighters, the Pentagon said.,''We don't know why they've moved these troops or exactly what they plan to do with the troops that they have marshaled around the borders of Kosovo,'' a spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth H. Bacon, said.,But another senior Administration official said the buildup was an ominous development that not only threatened to scuttle additional peace talks between President Slobodan Milovesic's Government and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but also plunge the Clinton Administration and NATO into a new crisis on dealing with a Serb offensive.,Despite the provocative maneuvers, which were made in a hiatus in the negotiations that are to resume on March 15 in France, the Administration backed off its threat to use force to enforce the troop levels negotiated in October between the United States and Mr. Milosevic.,Under that accord, Mr. Milosevic agreed to reduce Yugoslav forces in Kosovo at least to the levels of last February. That would have meant reducing the 18,000 Yugoslav Army troops who were there in October to 12,500 and paring the 11,000 Serbian paramilitary police officers to 6,500.,Asked whether NATO would strike if Yugoslavia poured fresh troops into Kosovo in violation of the accord, Mr. Bacon said:,''We will take appropriate and necessary action to protect people from humanitarian disasters, and we will also take any needed action to promote peace. Beyond that, I don't want to get into any specifics about hypothetical operations.'',When pressed, he added, ''The conduct of the troops is much more important than the numbers of the troops at this stage.'',Indeed, Pentagon and State Department officials acknowledged today that Belgrade had never fully complied with the original force withdrawal. In addition, the Serbs have deployed inside Kosovo about 70 tanks, 70 armored personnel carriers and 50 artillery pieces. Mr. Bacon said more than two times those forces were in garrisons. Administration officials said the levels also violated the October accord.,The United States has not publicized the violations or threatened aerial attacks to enforce the agreement, perhaps fearing that such strikes could wreck the peace negotiations, Administration officials said.,When asked what level of violations would draw a NATO response, Under Secretary of State Thomas A. Pickering said today at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee: ''I do not want to draw a series of maps with red lines for the Serbs. We need to avoid that very, very carefully.'',Mr. Pickering said any Serb violations of the cease-fire pact ''would clearly have grave and substantial risks.'',Senate Republicans, in the hearing room and on the Senate floor, attacked the Administration's Kosovo policy. ''Our troops are very expensive peacekeepers,'' Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, said on the floor. ''I'm very concerned we're going to be there a long, long time. I don't see an exit strategy.'',Senators' anger was stoked further when Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe told the committee that if the warring parties reached an agreement, the cost of contributing 4,000 American troops to the 28,000-member NATO peacekeeping force would be $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year.,The United States has already spent $10 billion to support American forces in Bosnia since 1995, and it is budgeting $2 billion a year for that peacekeeping. Spending an additional $2 billion a year for another indefinite military mission in Kosovo did not go over well today.,Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican who is on the Armed Services Committee, said:  ''What we're dealing with here is another open-ended commitment. Not to say that it doesn't merit our commitment. But I don't think we are prepared to acknowledge the extent to which we will have to commit thousands of men and women from our armed forces once again, and billions more in expenditures for an undetermined period of time.'',The Administration officials responded that the Kosovo crisis threatened stability in Europe, tested NATO credibility and could undercut the halting progress in Bosnia.,As for deadlines, President Clinton predicted three years ago that American troops would be out of Bosnia in a year. That did not happen, and his aides are not repeating that mistake. Instead, they say, progress in Kosovo should be measured by milestones like when security forces withdraw and elections are held.",ERIC SCHMITT,"FEB. 26, 1999","Serb Army Masses 4,500 Armored Troops",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/serb-army-masses-4500-armored-troops.html

"Sir Anthony Nutting, a Deputy Foreign Secretary who sacrificed a potentially brilliant political career by resigning over Britain's involvement in the 1956 attack on Suez, died of heart failure at his home in London on Tuesday. He was 79.,He had been the youngest member of Winston Churchill's Government after World War II and was a rising figure in the Conservative Party when he attended a fateful meeting of high-ranking British and French officials on Oct. 14, 1956.,Israel was about to attack Egypt, which under President Gamal Abdel Nasser had nationalized the Suez Canal. Sir Anthony learned at the secret gathering that Prime Minister Anthony Eden, his mentor, and the French had agreed that once fighting began they would send in their own paratroopers. The public justification would be the need to separate Israeli and Egyptian forces, but the true purpose, the leaders agreed, would be to support Israel, seize the canal and undermine Nasser.,Sir Anthony, who two years earlier negotiated the final steps of the treaty with Nasser under which British troops withdrew from Suez, believed that the mission was mistaken and deceitful. When British planes took to the air on Oct. 31, he decided to quit. For security reasons, he did not give the customary resignation speech to the House of Commons, and his unexplained action proved so unpopular that his constituents forced him to give up his seat in Parliament.,Harold Macmillan, who would later become Prime Minister himself, had urged him not to resign, saying that ''you will lead the party one day.'' Instead, Sir Anthony, at 36, found his political career in ruins.,He later wrote of feeling suddenly ''bereft of friends, a castaway adrift on a sea of anger and recrimination, an object of distrust, torn between loyalty to principle and loyalty to friends and associates.'',The British action ended up convulsing Parliament, speeding the end of the Eden Government, damaging the country's standing in the United Nations, straining London's relationship with Washington and complicating the West's attempt to obtain condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Hungary days later.,Sir Anthony kept his silence until 1967 when in his book ''No End of a Lesson'' he explained that backing the Suez action would have put him in the position of lying to the House of Commons and the United Nations.,''Either I had to tell the whole story as I saw it, or say nothing at all,'' he wrote. ''And as long as any of the chief protagonists of the Suez war still held high office in Britain, it would clearly have been a grave disservice to the nation, which they still led and represented in the councils of the world, to have told the whole story.'',Harold Anthony Nutting was born into a wealthy family in 1920 with estates in England and Scotland, and he was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied agriculture and kept a pack of hounds. He was unable to serve in World War II because of a steeplechasing injury, and he entered the Foreign Service. Both of his elder brothers were killed on active duty.,He was working at the British Embassy in Paris when France fell to the Germans, and from 1940 to 1944 he was assigned to the embassy in Madrid, where he organized escape routes for Allied servicemen caught behind the lines.,He won his parliamentary seat in 1945 and quickly became chairman of the Young Conservatives. He led the British delegation to the United Nations General Assembly and Disarmament Commission in 1954 and 1955. He was an internationalist, an Arabist and an early enthusiast for British membership of the European Economic Community.,In his later years, still a political outcast, he divided his time between writing biographies and histories in London, hunting in Shropshire and  gentleman farming in Scotland. He is survived by his third wife, Margarita, and a daughter and two sons from his first marriage.",WARREN HOGE,"FEB. 26, 1999","Sir Anthony Nutting, 79, Dies; 'No' on Suez Cost His Career",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/sir-anthony-nutting-79-dies-no-on-suez-cost-his-career.html
"The Securities and Exchange Commission sued 13 people and firms in six states today, contending that they had defrauded investors by using the Internet to pitch companies that paid them to promote the companies' shares.,In the commission's second nationwide crackdown on Internet promoters, it accused authors of on-line newsletters, World Wide Web sites and Internet junk mail with misrepresenting the companies' investment prospects or failing to disclose that they were getting paid by the companies.,The promoters, who purportedly provided unbiased opinions in their stock recommendations, received more than $450,000 and 2.7 million shares of stock and options from the companies, the commission said.,In one case, the commission said that P. Joseph Vertucci, president of Interactive Multimedia Publishers Inc., and a stockbroker, Bruce Straughn, schemed to pump up Interactive's share price by paying publications to promote the stock on the Internet. When Interactive's price rose, the commission charged, Mr. Vertucci, Mr. Straughn and several others sold their shares at a profit. The stock subsequently collapsed and the company ceased operation, the commission said.,In another case, the commission said a former broker, Scott P. Flynn, promoted 10 company stocks on the Stockprofiles.com Web site in exchange for $180,000 and 322,500 shares from the companies. Mr. Flynn's investor relations firm, Strategic Network Development of Minnesota, which was also charged, sent unsolicited electronic mail to 500,000 potential investors recommending low-priced stocks he was paid to tout, the commission said.,In a third case, the S.E.C. said that Arthur Max Ramras and his firm, RCG Capital Market Group Inc., touted nine stocks on its Web site in return for cash and stock options from November 1998 through last month. Mr. Ramras and his firm failed to disclose the compensation arrangement, the S.E.C. said.,In its first Internet fraud sweep in October, the commission filed 23 cases against 44 people and companies.",BLOOMBERG NEWS,"FEB. 26, 1999",S.E.C.

"All of the union local leaders who made Saturn one of the nation's most prominent experiments in labor relations have been voted out of office by union members, who chose new leaders who have advocated a more traditional and less close relationship with management.,The General Motors Corporation set up Saturn in Tennessee in 1986 in an effort to create a car company with labor relations that would be less rancorous and more cooperative. For the last 13 years, the local Saturn union had been led by Michael E. Bennett, who frequently defied the national leadership of the United Automobile Workers union by linking pay to productivity and encouraging workers to participate in a wide range of decisions with management.,Mr. Bennett and his entire slate of other union officials were defeated in elections on Wednesday, according to results that became official late Wednesday and were confirmed today by union officials.,Replacing Mr. Bennett will be Robert Williams, a vice president of the local union and a critic of current labor relations at Saturn.,Specialists in labor relations have come from around the world to study and praise Saturn's experiment at its 7,000-employee factory in Spring Hill, Tenn. But many of the workers have increasingly felt that they were making too many concessions to management, such as irregular workweeks that included work on Saturdays without overtime pay.,Workers' anger boiled over last summer when a strike at two General Motors parts factories in Flint, Mich., forced the closing of almost all of G.M.'s assembly plants in North America. The Saturn assembly plant remained open then because the local union leadership agreed to let G.M. use parts from other companies, including Japanese spark plugs.,The factory's membership voted for the first time ever then to authorize a strike but never walked out.,Mr. Williams, who won this week's election, was the only local union official who, in a union vote two years ago, advocated ending the existing labor contract at Saturn and replacing it with the national U.A.W. agreement in force at every other G.M. factory in the United States. Mr. Williams, who goes by the nickname Jeep, won 55.5 percent of the vote at Saturn's factory, while Mr. Bennett received 38.6 percent. Two other candidates had the rest of the vote.,In this week's election, Mr. Williams and his fellow candidates did not call for replacing the Saturn contract. But they did say that Saturn should stop linking pay to productivity and should adopt many work rules from other G.M. factories.,The vote comes at a particularly difficult time for G.M. Local union elections are usually held in late spring, but Mr. Bennett called early elections this year because the local union must decide what concessions to offer G.M. in exchange for a corporate commitment to build a car-based sport utility vehicle there in two years. Now, G.M. is likely to face a series of union demands even as it seeks promises of further improvements in productivity.,In another, apparently coincidental setback for Saturn, its vice president for sales and marketing, Joseph Kennedy, resigned on Wednesday to work for an Internet company in California. Mr. Kennedy had been one of G.M.'s young star executives but was passed over late last year for the chairmanship of Saturn when the man who built the car division, Donald Hudler, announced his retirement.,Mr. Bennett said today that he would not challenge the election results and planned to resign as of March 29, even though his term runs to the end of May. ''I'm going to remake my life and find another career,'' possibly as an author and consultant on labor relations, he said in a telephone interview.,Cynthia Trudell, who replaced Mr. Hudler as Saturn's chairman and president last month, said that she was surprised by the vote's outcome and would miss the current union leaders. But she insisted that Saturn could continue to grow with the new leaders.,''I'm very committed to working with the new group,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''They share the values of Saturn. They want to see the plant and the relationship grow.'',Union dissidents were delighted with the vote. ''It's the greatest day of my life,'' said Thomas Hopp, one of the organizers of the factory floor-level campaign to unseat Mr. Bennett. The men and women who won the election were working in the factory today and could not be reached for comment; Mr. Hopp, who installs side windows on the assembly line, had the day off today, partly because his work schedule this year includes 32 Saturdays without overtime pay.,Mr. Williams was an ally of Mr. Bennett in Saturn's early days. But the two men developed differences and Mr. Williams lost his position as an appointed, full-time union leader in the early 1990's and returned to work on the assembly line, Mr. Hopp said. Mr. Williams then ran successfully for an elected position as one of the local union's four vice presidents before taking on Mr. Bennett and winning the top job this week as the local union's ''manufacturing adviser.'',''He kind of rose like the phoenix and defeated his old adversary,'' Mr. Hopp said.",KEITH BRADSHER,"FEB. 26, 1999",Saturn Plant's Union Leaders Are Voted Out,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/business/saturn-plant-s-union-leaders-are-voted-out.html
"Groundwork is under way for a 30-story rental apartment building that is the first to take advantage of a 1995 rezoning that allows the construction of apartment buildings along a seven-and-a-half-block industrial stretch of the Avenue of the Americas between 24th and 31st Streets.,The $80 million project at 750 Avenue of the Americas, between 24th and 25th Streets, will have 300 studio to two-bedroom apartments. The project reflects Manhattan's strong rental market and, brokers said, the area's potential for becoming a new walk-to-work residential community because of its proximity to established neighborhoods like Chelsea and to midtown offices.,The new building, which will also have 15,000 square feet of retail space, will replace a parking lot on the block between 24th and 25th Streets that had long played host to an antiques fair and flea market every weekend. The Albanese Development Corporation of Garden City, N.Y., is developing the project in partnership with Arbor National Commercial Mortgage of Uniondale, N.Y.,Eighty percent of the 400- to 1,200-square-foot apartments will be rented at market values. The remaining 20 percent will be leased at reduced prices to tenants whose annual household income is no more than half of the median income for New York City, depending on household size, or $17,570 for a one-person household and $25,100 for a four-person household. In return for reserving those units for low-income tenants, the developer received tax-exempt bond financing from the state and is eligible for a 20-year property tax abatement from the city.,The building is Albanese's first rental and first so-called 80-20 project in Manhattan. But Albanese is no stranger to the city, having constructed, among other projects, 100 United Nations Plaza, a 52-story, 250-unit condominium at 48th Street and First Avenue.,Betting on the potential for change along the  Sixth Avenue corridor -- a mix of import and export businesses at its northern end, flower dealers around 28th Street and industrial concerns and parking lots in the lower 20's -- Albanese and its partners bought the 21,500-square-foot site in August 1997. They closed the deal last November, paying $16.5 million for the site, which is among the larger development parcels in the corridor.,''This is a terrific new neighborhood on the edge of Chelsea with unlimited upside,'' said Christopher V. Albanese, executive vice president at the company, stressing the area's convenient location and access to transit links, including Pennsylvania Station. Because of those factors, ''we feel we are not pioneering,'' he said, adding that ''with limited residential development in the corridor, there is a large untapped demand for rentals.'',Mr. Albanese said another reason the partners were proceeding with the project was that they could build it ''as of right,'' meaning no approvals or permits were needed. The 80-20 method of tax-exempt financing was also attractive, he said.,The project received $76 million in bond financing from the New York State Housing Finance Agency. The partners also secured a letter of credit from Fleet Bank, which is required to protect bondholders against default, and are investing some of their own equity.,''It has taken awhile for the Sixth Avenue corridor to catch on,'' said Peter R. Hauspurg, chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a real estate investment banking company in Manhattan that represented the partners in buying the site. ''But this is one of the few areas left where developers can buy land and afford to construct rental housing.'' Since 1996, he said, land prices in the area have risen to nearly $100 per buildable square foot, from $40.,The building at 750 Avenue of the Americas is ''what the rezoning anticipated,'' said Kevin Finnegan, first vice chairman of Community Board 5, whose district includes the east side of the avenue, where the new building will rise. The west side is in a district covered by Community Board 4. ''It's clearly a hot residential market,'' he said, observing that the parking lot sites in the corridor ''are sitting there waiting to be developed.'',The developer Harry Macklowe is under contract to buy a parking lot site on the west side of the avenue between 26th and 27th Streets and plans to start construction this summer on a 32-story, 260-unit luxury rental building. The Adell Corporation of Greenwich, Conn., which applied with the City Planning Department to rezone the corridor, is still determining the best uses for the three sites it owns between 25th and 28th Streets, said Steve Solomon, a company spokesman.,Another prominent site in the neighborhood but outside the rezoned corridor is a parking lot in the Ladies Mile Historic District at the southeast corner of 23d Street. The owner is the Manocherian family, which, Mr. Finnegan said, has approvals to build a 22-story rental building.,''This is the next new neighborhood for new construction,'' said Brian G. Edwards, director of leasing at the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan brokerage. ''It's a natural progression from Chelsea and is surrounded by positive residential services, so people will migrate to it.'',Demand is sufficient to support new rentals there, he said, noting that rents for new apartments downtown continued to rise. The average rents range from $38 to $45 a square foot a year, up 6 percent from last year, or $2,200 to $2,400 a month for a one-bedroom unit.,Mr. Albanese said monthly rents at 750 Avenue of the Americas were projected to be $1,700 to $4,000 but could change, depending on the market when the building is completed in 16 months. Rents for the low-income units are to be $300 to $600 a month.,The building, designed by the Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron, will have a rose brick facade and decorative limestone bays at the base. There will be limestone-colored brick and trim throughout the building. Planned amenities include a health club and sun deck, as well as 60 parking spaces.

"IT is one of New York City's weirder environmental ironies: as the mucky rivers get cleaner and clearer, kayakers and striped bass are not the only things coming back to the water. A couple of tiny, voracious creatures -- a mollusk and a crustacean -- have also begun to reappear, and it seems their sole occupation is to eat all the wooden pilings that support nearly everything along the edge of the waterbound city.,The creatures, collectively known as marine borers, have been a major maritime headache for as long as anyone can remember (historians say they ruined two of Columbus's ships during his last voyage to the New World). Here in the city, people have been cursing them and trying to stop them and getting dumped into the river because of them for more than a decade now.,But during that time, perhaps no one has seen as many of them and in quite the same way as Adam Brown.,In fact, there aren't many people who have ever seen the city in quite the same way as Mr. Brown, a trim, energetic man who lives in the East Village but who once fashioned an apartment out of the stateroom of a rusty, decommissioned tugboat at a condemned TriBeCa pier.,Mr. Brown, 37, the president of a group that advocates restoration of the waterfront for maritime uses, has been a professional inspection diver for more than 15 years. In very cold and very dark water, he has worked for several marine engineering firms hired by the city and state to assess borer damage.,He has poked and prodded his way along the entire underside of the East River Drive and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, from Battery Park 11 miles north. He has inspected tens of thousands of pilings beneath piers all around the city. And in addition to mollusks and crustaceans, he has seen more than a few other creepy things.,''Let's put is this way: I have seen a whole lot of Manhattan that not many people get to see,'' Mr. Brown said this week, showing off the now-sunken tugboat that was his home. ''And down there, I have also seen a couple of people from Manhattan that I did not want to see.'' (Here he relates a story that is probably best left to the imagination.),But Mr. Brown said that what is even scarier than the possibility of bumping into a body is the possibility that a pier or roadway above his head will collapse because of the extensive damage wrought by the borers. The crustacean, Limnoria lignorum, commonly known as a gribble, eats the pilings from the outside, giving them a kind of hourglass shape. The mollusk, known as a shipworm, drills into the wood and devours the inside of the pilings.,Sometimes the piling looks intact from the outside but is actually hollow. Other times, there are tiny holes, which Mr. Brown spots using a high-powered light.,''It looks a little like Swiss cheese,'' he said, ''but it's all Swiss and no cheese. You can poke your finger into the piling and the wood just breaks away.'',LAST year, a popular West Side pier was closed when inspectors discovered that the creatures had eroded the supports to the point of danger. The year before, six people plunged into the East River when a section of the India Street Pier in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, collapsed because of borer damage. And city officials have said they are now about to award a $6 million contract to an engineering firm to examine ways to repair deteriorated wooden supports beneath the F.D.R. Drive.,Through the years, since graduating from the Florida Institute of Technology with a degree in marine sciences, Mr. Brown has taken diving jobs everywhere from Baltimore to an oil rig off the coast of Puerto Rico to the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. (''That was the nastiest.''),But he is the first to admit that diving is probably the last profession he should have chosen.,He suffers from serious bouts of claustrophobia. He says that ''drowning is absolutely the worst kind of death I can imagine.'' Before he was in junior high school, he had no real love for the water, unless you count playing in the ocean at Fire Island. His father, Herb, is an abstract expressionist painter, and his mother, Marian, works in the theater.,He remembered that the first time he even wondered about diving was when his father brought home an outlandish snorkel, with air tubes that used ping-pong balls as valves.,Mr. Brown and his twin brother, who lives in Seattle, both began hanging around diving shops and enrolled in Beach Channel High School in Rockaway Park, which specializes in preparing students for careers in marine sciences and maritime work. On weekends, sometimes even in the dead of winter, the brothers would drag their heavy tanks, weight belts and gear onto the A train and go to the Rockaways to practice diving.,But all the years of diving in near-freezing water have taken their toll on Mr. Brown. He has arthritis in both hands and said he now hopes to make the waterfront advocacy group he helped found, the Working Waterfront Association, a full-time job.,It is something that Mr. Brown talks about with some ambivalence, but he says that at least it will make his mother happy.,''She just can't stand to hear any of my stories at all, because she's afraid,'' he said, adding with a smile, ''I think she still hopes maybe one day I'll become a doctor.''",RANDY KENNEDY,"FEB. 26, 1999",PUBLIC LIVES; A Man With a Fish's-Eye View of the City,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/public-lives-a-man-with-a-fish-s-eye-view-of-the-city.html

He was stranded in St. Louis  for two days by a snowstorm. That may have been one of the occasions on which he took to his Bible, which he says he reads a lot.,''Not because I'm so religious,'' he said, ''but I like the Psalms, and each time I notice different things.'',At the library, he donated three books, including his autobiography, which he autographed. He also pointed out a need to expand the Slavic and Baltic division.,''More people from the former Communist bloc countries are writing and publishing books than can read them,'' he said. ''Almost everybody writes a book.'',DR. PAUL LeCLERC, the president of the library, took Mr. Walesa straight up to the Rose Main Reading Room, to show off the new restoration.,Mr. Walesa suggested that binoculars be placed alongside the computers, the better to contemplate the paintings on the ceiling. Then he observed, ''There is no democracy without a good checkbook.''

He shot a look toward ETHAN STEIFEL, a star of the American Ballet Theater, who was also at the table. ''All right, it's not real dance, but we give it a shot,'' he said.,When Mr. Madden was asked how he felt about his Oscar nomination, he grinned.

"Lewis Katz stepped into the world of professional sports last fall, making idealistic proclamations of social good and community uplift. At a time when the National Basketball Association was embroiled in a labor dispute that sullied the public's perception of its players and owners, Katz was emerging as a welcomed, if somewhat hard-to-believe, champion of altruism as the new managing owner and co-chairman of the Nets.,He spoke of donating nearly 40 percent of the team's profits to social-service programs that benefited inner-city youths, of moving the Nets to a new arena in Newark to revitalize business and hope in that decaying urban center, and of using his franchise as a platform for solving urban ills through private enterprise.,Now, after yesterday's announcement that the Nets plan to merge with the powerful and storied Yankees, the platform and possibilities have grown tremendously, raising the questions as to just who is Lewis Katz and what are his motivations.,''We are not in ownership to get richer,'' said Katz, previously the controlling stockholder of Kinney Parking Systems. ''We want to bring not only a championship to the franchise, but to elevate it to reaching a higher good in terms of improving the quality of people's lives. We have enough money. What we may not have is enough time to try to help solve the problems.'',Katz, 57, solved a burgeoning problem for his noble intentions by partnering the Nets with the Yankees. Instead of having nearly 40 percent of the struggling Nets' profits -- if there are any profits -- go into his social- service endeavors, he will be in position to donate 20 percent of the profits of the much more lucrative YankeeNets, the new company being formed by the two clubs.,A native of Camden, N.J., Katz became involved with the Nets through his friend, Ray Chambers, a well-known New Jersey philanthropist who shuns the attention of the news media and declined interview requests for this article. Last year, when the Nets were on the verge of being sold and relocated to Long Island, Chambers put together 15 investors to purchase two-thirds of the Nets for $150 million. The desire was to keep the team in New Jersey and perhaps ignite a new trend in professional sports ownership, in which at least some profits could be used for social purposes.,Chambers and Katz each invested $25 million into the Nets and then donated their 38 percent stake in the team to their newly formed Community Youth Organization, a nonprofit trust dedicated to assisting inner-city youths in the moribund cities of Newark, Camden, Paterson, Trenton and Jersey City.,So while the other owners of the Nets hope to receive a return on their investments, particularly now that the Nets and Yankees are merging,  Chambers and Katz will not, because whatever profit they realize will go to the C.Y.O.,The C.Y.O. will provide such services as scholarships, tutorial programs, nutritional programs and possibly even housing renovation and health care in New Jersey's inner-city neighborhoods. And now that the Nets are joining with the Yankees, the C.Y.O's efforts will almost undoubtedly extend into the South Bronx neighborhood around Yankee Stadium.,''It would be so wonderful if we could start a trend,'' said Katz, who in conjunction with Chambers has pledged to donate $200,000 a year to the C.Y.O. if there are no profits. ''Most guys that own teams probably aren't in need of money. And we think that because sports is a high-visibility business, it just offers more to kids, and maybe the message even gets to the players -- that sports doesn't just have to be about winning and money.'',Such high-minded claims become easy targets from cynics. Even Michael Rowe, the Nets president since 1995, admitted to having doubts when first informed of the new owners' intentions. ''I was originally skeptical that this was not the real world of the N.B.A. or professional sports,'' Rowe said. ''But the more time I spent with them, the more I thought, 'Why not?' '',Last January, Bill Cosby, an old friend of Katz's when they attended Temple University in the 60's, invested several million dollars in the Nets to join the fold as an adviser to the C.Y.O. In addition to providing a vision and direction for the program, Cosby hopes to help professional athletes better manage their finances and project a more positive image off the court. One person familiar with Cosby's concerns said: ''He's tired of waking up and reading about N.B.A. players spending their money irresponsibly and having all of these children out of wedlock. He wants to help them avoid anything that might be a negative influence.'',''I didn't come into this to own human beings,'' Cosby said from a courtside seat at a Nets game last week. ''These young men have a chance to be very conservative with their money and then set goals of helping themselves and helping others. That's the ideal that we hope to bring to the Nets and the Yankees.'',Cosby and Katz met while working at Temple in a coat room and hit it off immediately because both were aspiring comedians. They teamed up to start a free weekly concert series called ''The Hour of Pleasure,'' but because their budget was so sparse, they would often advertise fictitious acts and then have Cosby perform his comedy routine. '''They would say, 'Sorry, the act canceled at the last minute, but Temple's own Bill Cosby's going to entertain you,' '' said Drew Katz, Lewis's son.,Cosby and Katz also bonded over sports. Cosby played on Temple's football team and ran on the track team, and Katz, according to his boyhood friend, Richard Riggs, ''always hung around the athletes.'' While growing up poor in Camden, Katz's favorite sport was basketball. His mother was widowed when he was an infant and he tells of how athletes became his role models to fill the void in his life from not having a father. He recalls pretending to be Paul Arizin of the Philadelphia Warriors while playing on the dirt-and-gravel court near his home.,''One of the things that basketball did for me in terms of values was that it taught me sportsmanship, honest competition and at the same time, gave my life some purpose, '' said Katz, who played one year at Camden High School. ''I really looked forward to seeing Boston and Philly play the night before Thanksgiving. You grew up identifying with the hometown team.'',That is why Katz is so intent on moving the Nets to Newark. He believes that bringing a team back to the inner city will provide not only an economic boon for the area but inspiration to the neighborhood's children, many of whom are growing up fatherless as he did.,''Think about all those residents who will wake up one day and say, 'My God, somebody really cared enough to bring back an N.B.A. team to my city,' '' Katz said. ''Think about the self-esteem that comes from identifying with that. I know, because that's how it was for me.'',A lawyer who once served as the finance chairman for New Jersey's Democratic Party, he struck gold by buying and reviving Kinney Parking Systems. Last year, he sold the company to Central Parking for $225 million.,That enabled him to enter what he calls ''the third chapter'' of his life -- ''the giving-back chapter.'' It is a chapter getting more interesting by the day.",CHRIS BROUSSARD,"FEB. 26, 1999",PRO BASKETBALL; Nets' Game Plan: Assists to Youth,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/sports/pro-basketball-nets-game-plan-assists-to-youth.html
"When the Knicks are desperate, they send up a flare for Allan Houston and hope to be rescued.,For the second consecutive game, Houston responded like a player who is growing into a leading star. He hit a game-deciding 3-point shot with 4.6 seconds left to punctuate the end to a thrilling and exhausting 115-113 overtime victory for the Knicks against the Minnesota Timberwolves last night at a raucous Madison Square Garden.,The crowd was alive for the first time all season as it watched its plodding team keep up with all the youthful enthusiasm the Timberwolves could dish out. If Stephon Marbury had the nerve to send the game into overtime with a nine-foot runner, then Marcus Camby could have the energy to leap up and block Marbury's driving layup attempt to tie it with seven-tenths of a second left. Kevin Garnett, who scored 25 points for Minnesota, failed to convert an alley-oop pass for Minnesota at the buzzer.,It was an intense game of poker all night -- ''I'll see your driving layup and raise you a 3-pointer'' -- and it was Houston who forced the Timberwolves to fold in the end. He did the same thing two nights earlier when he broke the Nets on a 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter. In that game, it was Patrick Ewing who caught Houston standing alone in the right corner and passed him the ball for an open 3-pointer.,Last night, it was Larry Johnson. Instead of panicking with the shot clock and game clock winding down, the Knicks passed inbounds with 27 seconds left and patiently worked the ball into the post. Johnson (22 points) drew the double team, saw Houston wide open and fired him the ball. Houston calmly delivered the 3-pointer from the left wing to cap a 26-point night.,''When guys start looking for each other, that's what happens,'' Houston said. ''I'm fortunate I had the opportunity that I did. I wouldn't have expected to be open, but I was. All I saw was the bottom of the rim.'',There were times last season when Houston was not even on the floor during the game's critical moments. There were times when it seemed he was inhibited by Ewing's presence and was never going to break out into his own. Houston seems bolder and braver now.,''Allan stepped up and drained a big shot,'' said Coach Jeff Van Gundy, whose team is 8-3 after an 0-2 start. ''You're going to live with that shot, make or miss. And I'll take my chances with Allan making that one.'',At the moment of splashdown for his shot, Houston began bouncing around the court and flapping his arms. The rest of the Knicks floated right along with him, dismissing the fatigue in their legs.,The Timberwolves (8-3) entered the game with the league's second-best offense and a most dangerous point guard in Brooklyn's own Marbury, who might have been trying too hard to impress. He was 7 of 25 for 20 points and had 9 turnovers. Still, he had a chance to be the hero but had his driving layup blocked by Camby (5 blocked shots) to seal the game.,''I know he likes to take that shot,'' Camby said. ''I was at the right place at the right time.'',The Knicks' timing was impeccable. When Ewing (7 of 14 from the field and 20 points) looked on the brink of fizzling in the end, he came up with an 11-foot jumper with 46 seconds left in an overtime that had five lead changes. When the game looked to be getting away from the Knicks in the first quarter, Charlie Ward hit a 3-pointer from halfcourt at the buzzer.,Early on, the Knicks, who were down by as many as 16 points in the first half, looked as if they would get run off the floor. Despite being outrebounded by 58-38, the Knicks hung in there, thanks in large part to Ward. He hit a lot of big shots. Houston walked off as the celebrated star, but it was Ward who might have been most satisfied. Each time Ward has heard his name dangled in trade talks or been told that Marbury was on the team's wish list or listened as his name surfaced when the Knicks' weakness were discussed, he has burned beneath his stoic facade.,On this night, in front of the talented Marbury, Ward took the opportunity for catharsis. Ward had 18 points and 13 assists, while the turnover-prone Marbury was forcing shots.,''If you're looking for a guy who every night is going to shoot the ball 20 times and break teams down off the dribble and in isolation, that's not Charlie,'' Van Gundy said. ''Charlie's a pass-first point guard who has a feeling for a team.'',This Knicks team seems to have a good feel for each other. On some nights, they are still Ewing's team. On others, Johnson is left to carry the weight. And more often than not, Houston is the one his teammates look for when the game is on the line. Even so, it's hard to say Houston is their only go-to guy.,''If you look at everything,'' Van Gundy said, ''we missed big free throws, we got killed on the boards and played terrible defense in the first half. On the other hand, we found a way to win and we were mentally tough.'',They were not always this way last year. There was Game 4 against Indiana in the playoffs. When Reggie Miller hit a wide-open 3-pointer to tie the score, the Knicks had nothing left in overtime. This time was different.,''Last year, when we went into overtime against Indiana, Game 4, we fell apart,'' Van Gundy said. ''We weren't mentally tough in that game. Tonight, we talked about that. We were much more mentally tough.'',Houston displayed that for the second night in a row.,REBOUNDS,The Timberwolves' 61 points in the first half was a Knicks opposition high this season. . . . The Knicks had three players reach at least 20 points for the first time this season. . . . PATRICK EWING has 24 blocks in the last four games, including six last night. . . . The Knicks were concerned about flight plans to Boston for tonight's game. Some reports warned that there could be up to 18 inches of snow overnight. ''Hopefully, everyone will make it,'' JEFF VAN GUNDY said. ''It's a long shot that the game will be canceled, but if the unthinkable occurred, there are precious few days on the crammed schedule to make it up.'' . . . Van Gundy praised the often overlooked coach of the Timberwolves, FLIP SAUNDERS. Minnesota's vice president for basketball operations, KEVIN McHALE, handpicked Saunders out of the Continental Basketball Association.

"Walking off the court on the short end of the score for the fifth consecutive game, the Nets had enough on their mind Wednesday night, and that was before they knew they had been merged with the New York Yankees.,With a 2-9 mark, the coach and the players seem to be sniping at one another, and at least one member of the Nets, Chris Gatling, is asking out.,Gatling made his trade request in a meeting with Coach John Calipari before the Nets' 94-85 loss Wednesday night to the Portland Trail Blazers, New Jersey's fifth straight defeat in a season rapidly spinning out of control.,The Nets did not practice today -- their next game is at home on Saturday night against the Boston Celtics -- but Gatling was on the minds of the team's co-captains, Jayson Williams and Kendall Gill, both of whom showed up at the team's practice facility.,Both co-captains felt that Gatling, who was expected to be a key contributor off the bench but has barely played in recent games, had let his emotions get the better of him. But they also felt that since Gatling had made his feelings known, then maybe it was time for the eight-year veteran forward to move on.,''You don't want somebody who's not going to be happy coming to work,'' Williams said. ''It makes everybody else not happy. If Gat wants to be traded, then they should do what they can to trade him.'',Gill, who was answering questions about his own status with rumors circulating that he could be dealt for Golden State's John Starks, said: ''I think that Gat is frustrated, probably, because of his lack of playing time. He probably thinks he could be more productive. He's asked to be traded before. I don't know how serious this one is. Sooner or later, you've got to make up your mind what you want to do. I don't know if he just forgets about it the next day.,''Players want to be traded every day. They think that the grass is greener on the other side. It's just bad that it happens at this time when the team is struggling.'',Gill had little to say about the trade rumors. A year ago this month, he was nearly dealt away in separate deals with Toronto and Atlanta, so when word surfaced of his name in a deal to bring Starks to the Nets, he did not panic.,''I have no reaction to it,'' Gill said. ''I don't think it is going to happen. Of course, when a team goes through trouble, you talk about shaking the team up. But I'm not the problem.'',Both Williams and Gill expressed hope that the Nets would not panic over the 2-9 start and begin tinkering with the pieces.,Gill, who saw that happen when he was in Charlotte with a team that included Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson, said: ''No one is jumping ship. As long as you have your core guys, and I'm not saying that Gat is not a core guy, but Jayson, Keith, Kerry, myself, we're not jumping ship.'',Williams added: ''When you're 2-9, I think people don't want to get used to losing, so I think they're going to shake it up. But I don't think they're going to shake up the core players. And if we're not going to do that, shaking up the 11th or 12th man doesn't really make a difference.'',If the Nets were the Yankees, they would still have about 150 games to right themselves in time for the post-season. But in this shortened National Basketball Association season, the Nets have already dug themselves a big hole. They get a chance to start digging out Saturday night.",STEVE POPPER,"FEB. 26, 1999","PRO BASKETBALL; As Nets Sink, Gatling Looks to Bail Out",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/sports/pro-basketball-as-nets-sink-gatling-looks-to-bail-out.html
"President Clinton may not have been gloating today, but he sure was celebrating.,Indulging a sometime adversary and delighting in his own economic record, Mr. Clinton basked in bright sun and warm ovations here as he shopped, talked baseball and promoted his proposals to preserve Social Security and Medicare.,Among the speakers welcoming him to the convention center was Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who voted to impeach him. Mr. Kolbe praised the President's leadership on Social Security and noted twice to the boisterous crowd of 2,000 that he had flown in with Mr. Clinton on Air Force One. He sat down beside the President, leaning toward him and whispering.,In his own remarks, Mr. Clinton thanked Mr. Kolbe -- perhaps generously, perhaps pointedly -- for ''crossing district and party lines to be here with us today.'',Asked later if he still believed Mr. Clinton was unfit for office, Mr. Kolbe paused and then said: ''The impeachment's over. Let's talk about Social Security here.'',Mr. Kolbe has also proposed detailed repairs to the Social Security system, and aides to Mr. Clinton insisted that he was fond of the Congressman and harbored no grudge.,Mr. Clinton was so sunny in his own remarks that he converted even his bad news to good. The fact that Social Security and Medicare were in trouble, he said, was ''a high-class problem'' -- evidence that medical care and prosperity were letting people live longer.,''This is nothing to wring your hands about,'' he said. But, he added, ''we have a responsibility to the future.'',Mr. Clinton was in such a generous mood that he skipped right over a dig at Republicans' tax cut plans prepared by his speechwriters and released to the press before he spoke.,While Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kolbe may be trying to put impeachment behind them -- at least in public -- the same could not be said of the few dozen protesters outside clamoring for the President's resignation or of the Democrats inside, many of whom booed Mr. Kolbe.,After leaving the convention center, Mr. Clinton stopped at a store to inspect some silver and turquoise jewelry and then visited the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, which is in spring training. He wandered onto the field to chat with players and to collect a jersey bearing the number one and the name Clinton.,He is on a six-day trip that will include three days of vacation with his family in Utah. Among the stops is San Francisco, with plans to raise about $1 million for Democrats.,Before Mr. Clinton arrived, several elderly people in the crowd said they were confident that the politicians would find a way to protect Social Security and Medicare. But then they seemed to have few complaints about anything.,''This is what they call the good life, baby,'' Herb Bloom said with a slow grin.,Mr. Bloom, 84, said he trusted Mr. Clinton to preserve the retirement security system.,''The Republicans are sort of hanging back on it, as usual,'' he said.,But Mr. Clinton also hung back today. While he advocated strengthening the retirement system by paying off the national debt -- even envisioning a ''debt-free'' nation in 2018 -- he avoided any talk of cutting benefits or raising taxes. He spoke vaguely of ''somewhat controversial'' decisions that policymakers would have to make, and he urged his listeners to support their Congressman as he makes them.,The Democrats' affection for Mr. Clinton seemed undimmed by the sexual assault accusation against him that was reported the night before on NBC television. In an interview with NBC News, Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman, accused Mr. Clinton of assaulting her more than 20 years ago. Through a lawyer, Mr. Clinton has denied the charge.,People came to see the President generally dismissed the accusation as unbelievable or ancient history.,Carolyn Killian, a 31-year-old homemaker, noted that Ms. Broaddrick had once signed an affidavit saying she had had no sexual relationship with Mr. Clinton. ''She must be a liar, too,'' Ms. Killian said.,Debbie Van Sant, a 42-year-old  pharmacist, said that she had voted for Ross Perot, but that she had come to support Mr. Clinton over the last year.,''After all of this fiasco,'' she said, ''I have a lot of respect for the man for standing up for what he believes in. It shows character in a person.''",JAMES BENNET,"FEB. 26, 1999","President, in West, Is Mixing Politics, Rest and Fund-Raising",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/us/president-in-west-is-mixing-politics-rest-and-fund-raising.html
"Last year this affluent, image-savvy town that abuts Newark toyed with the idea of changing its name. Worried that the other Oranges -- namely the poorer and largely urban Orange and East Orange -- were dragging it down, a group of residents here proposed rechristening their 120-year-old town South Mountain Village. The campaign, which opponents called racist, ultimately failed.,Tonight, after its most famous resident, Lauryn Hill, brought home five Grammy awards, a record for a female artist, there was little talk about burying the name South Orange. From the local Starbucks, where Manhattan-bound commuters grab their daily mochachinos, to Kevin's, a gritty tavern on the Newark border, this suburb of 18,000 was reveling in the success of the country's most celebrated hip-hop star.,But it was more than simple pride in a local-girl-made-good. Many residents said that Ms. Hill's decision to remain in South Orange long after she had achieved fame was an affirmation of integration in a town that has clearly been struggling with its racial identity.,''I think her success really helps legitimize our community and its diversity,'' said the village's elected president, William Calabrese, who opposed the name-change effort. ''We want to show the world that our town can thrive with all colors and creeds, and Ms. Hill is helping us do that.'',Success for Ms. Hill, 24, has come swiftly. While still in Columbia High School, the local school, she formed the Fugees with two friends, and although the group's first record bombed, their second, ''The Score,'' has sold more than 17 million copies worldwide.,But it was this year's solo debut, ''The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' that brought her an avalanche of critical acclaim and landed her on the cover of Time. The record, which won the Album of the Year Grammy and has sold three million copies, showed Ms. Hill to be a masterful songwriter and innovative performer who seamlessly fuses soul, rap, reggae and rhythm-and-blues.,''Lauryn has created a new genre of hip-hop,'' said Selwyn Hinds, the editor of The Source, a music magazine. ''She's proof that hip-hop has truly crossed over to the mainstream.'',Ms. Hill's manager said she was not available to talk, but in numerous interviews over the last year, she has voiced pride in her decision to stay in South Orange. ''This is the place where I started,'' she told Details magazine in November, a few weeks before she had her second son, Selah. ''So the same fire I had originally is the one I maintain when I'm here. And when it comes to hip-hop, it's very important to stay in touch with who you are, so I probably won't ever move very far away.'',She recently bought a second house in South Orange, where she lives with her parents, her boyfriend and their two children. The house in which she grew up has been turned into a recording studio, where she produced her Grammy album.,All across town, those who know Ms. Hill said fame had not spoiled her. Standing behind the counter of his Campus Sub Shop, Joe Imperial, 40, said he appreciated that Ms. Hill and members of her crew still stopped in for sandwiches. ''Even though she's a big deal, she hasn't forgotten where she came from,'' said Mr. Imperial, recalling how he served Ms. Hill countless chicken cheese heros when she was a child -- a sandwich he says she invented. ''We should probably rename it for her.'',Like many longtime residents and business owners, Mr. Imperial said the changes in South Orange had been dizzying, especially in the neighborhood near his shop, a few blocks from the Newark border. ''It used to be all white around here,'' he said, shaking his head as he looked out the window. But the demographic shift, he said, has been a good thing. His 18-year-old business is thriving and Mr. Imperial has no intention of leaving the neighborhood. ''I'm glad Lauryn is sticking around,'' he said. ''I think her decision to stay will influence a lot of the young people that this isn't a place to run away from.'',It is a message that town officials are eagerly trying to get out.,Like many aging surburbs on the fringe of troubled cities, South Orange has been trying to maintain its real-estate values and vaunted public schools in the face of heavy demographic change. According to the 1990 Census, the town's black population grew to 19 percent, up from less than 5 percent in 1970. But a more revealing figure is the composition of the school district, which is now more than 50 percent black, up from 22 percent eight years ago.,''There's a lot of anxiety in the community that the schools aren't what they used to be,'' said Carol Penny Bolden, a guidance counselor at Columbia High School in Maplewood, which draws students from both towns. ''Of course, those of us in the building still see the excellence, but unfortunately it's a matter of perception.'',To help counter negative perceptions, the two towns formed a Racial Diversity Task Force, which has been trying to fight racial steering by real-estate brokers while publicizing the towns to prospective homeowners and promoting racial harmony among its residents.,On the face of it, town officials should have nothing to complain about. Property values have soared over the last six years, especially since New Jersey Transit began offering direct train service to New York, which reduced the trip to Manhattan by nearly half, to 22 minutes. The average sale price for homes in South Orange is $240,000, up from $203,600 in 1992, according to Roy Scott, who is the owner of the Re/ Max Village Square Agency in South Orange.,Still, the changing demographics worry many residents, who recognize that racial ghettoization, even in well-to-do suburban communities, benefits no one.,Falling test scores -- and the school's rising black population -- have caused some white families to send their children to private schools.,Still ranked among the best in the state, the South Orange-Maplewood schools continue to draw outsiders. They come from both New York City or struggling towns to the east, as did Ms. Hill's parents, who moved here from East Orange when Lauryn was in fifth grade.,Ms. Hill was the second of two children born to Valerie Hill, a high school English teacher, and Mal Hill, a computer programer. Her family's home was crammed with Motown 45's and Sixties Soul, which Lauryn incessantly played as a child. Music was a central part of the Hill home. Mr. Hill sang at weddings, Mrs. Hill played the piano and Lauryn's brother, Melaney, played the saxophone, guitar and drums.,Friends and former teachers recall Ms. Hill as an overachiever who could effortlessly juggle advanced placement biology, violin lessons and dance class. ''Lauryn was a gifted student, but more than a student, she was a teacher, someone who influenced a lot of other kids,'' recalled LuElla Peniston, one of her guidance counselors. ''She really had a vision for bringing people together.'',She founded the school's gospel choir, led the cheerleading team, took acting classes in Manhattan and at 13, she sang Smokey Robinson's ''Who's Lovin' You?'' at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. For a few months she had a recurring role on ''As the World Turns,'' and during her senior year she landed a sizable part in ''Sister Act 2.'' All the while, she was writing and singing songs in the basement of her friends Wyclef Jean and Prakazrel (Pras) Michel. The three later took the name the Fugees (short for Refugee), and when she was 18, they put out their first album.,Carol Petrallia, her English teacher during sophomore and senior year, said Ms. Hill showed other students that one can do well academically and still have outside interests. ''This is the legacy we hope she leaves,'' she said.,As students changed classes at Columbia High yesterday, the halls were buzzing with talk of Ms. Hill's Grammy sweep.,Even those with no interest in her music said they were excited at her success. Standing in front of school, Sarah Kwiatkowski and her friends said they hoped Ms. Hill's fame would rub off on the community and the widespread perception that Columbia was going downhill.,Sarah, who works as a baby-sitter after school, said that many of the parents she worked for worried about sending their children to Columbia. ''We've been getting such a bad rap lately,'' she said. ''Maybe all this attention will convince people that our school isn't so bad after all.''",ANDREW JACOBS,"FEB. 26, 1999",Pop Superstar's Vote for Her Town; Lauryn Hill and 5 Grammys Are Firmly in South Orange,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/pop-superstar-s-vote-for-her-town-lauryn-hill-5-grammys-are-firmly-south-orange.html
"Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in New York City this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.,* DAVE ALVIN AND ROBBIE FULKS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Deep affection for the rockabilly twang carried Dave Alvin and Robbie Fulks in different directions. Mr. Alvin looks at outcasts, lovers and criminals, setting his narratives in tunes that aim for classic American simplicity while his words detail an uncertain moral landscape. Robbie Fulks applies his craftsmanship to country tunes, folk-rock and Beatles-style pop, packing the familiar styles with ambitious twists and lyrics that can be savage or desperate. While his characters might be borderline sociopaths, Mr. Fulks's impeccable band and his knee-pumping exuberance turn their troubles into a good time. Lily Montero opens tonight at 9; admission is $12 (Jon Pareles).,ANTIETAM, SHACKWACKY, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, between Delancey and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. There are plenty of varieties of rock guitar gods -- grandstanders and chord crunchers, sound mutilators and sexy tone masseurs. Tara Key of Antietam is a channeler. She runs her hands over the wood and steel of her instrument and finds a link; she transforms under the power of feedback, volume and melody. Her longtime rhythm section buoys her as she rides, crashing over and over into the waves of noise. Shackwacky, here reuniting after several fallow years, offers less tumultuous pleasures. The trio, made up of the divinely earthy Angel Dean, Lianne Smith and Philip Dray, does country the urban-bohemian way and pop with a charmingly skewed perspective on Sunday at 8 P.M.; $8 (Ann Powers).,DR. JOHN, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. On his most recent album, he applies his growly voice and slow-rolling grooves to songs about things that trouble his conscience, adding messages to the party. Tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 P.M.; there is a $30 cover and a $5 minimum; tomorrow at 9 P.M. is sold out (Pareles).,CANO ESTREMERA, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. The Puerto Rican singer is for some the best improviser in salsa, and when he's onstage and challenged by another singer, watch out -- the show becomes a cutting contest. Mr. Estremera, along with Gilberto Santa Rosa, is one of salsa's great living singers. The show on Sunday starts at 9 P.M.; there is a $10 cover (Peter Watrous).,SLIDE HAMPTON, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. He is one of jazz's best trombonists and one of its best arrangers, too. He'll be coming with a new idea, including a synthesizer in the works, and a two-trombone front line. The band includes Andrew Williams on trombone, Jiro Yoshida on guitar, Hiro Iida on synthesizer, James Williams on piano, Ron Carter on bass and Oliver Gene Lake on drums. Shows are at 8, 10:30 and midnight tonight and tomorrow, with a $20 cover and $10 minimum, and at 7 and 9 P.M. on Sunday, with a $15 cover and a $10 minimum (Watrous).,* HAMZA EL-DIN, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Hamza el-Din, from Egypt, is a cosmopolitan musician -- he has lived in Rome, Tokyo and now the San Francisco Bay area --  who has fully imagined his own roots. The Nubian songs he has reconstructed are as stark as music gets, often just a vocal line and an accompanying melody plucked on the oud. But his fusion of Nubian and Arabic traditions has a gentle approachability and a hypnotic dignity. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; admission is $21 (Pareles).,BARRY HARRIS, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. What tempos he calls, and what a lovely way of turning high-velocity be-bop lines into gorgeous melodies. Mr. Harris, a pianist, has a way of calming down the music, of making its figures, its vocabulary, flower with new meaning. He will be joined by Chuck Israels on bass and Leroy Williams on drums. Sets this weekend are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. with no third set on Sunday. The cover is $30 tonight and tomorrow, including a $10 drink credit. On Sunday there is a $20 cover, including credit (Watrous).,RICHIE HAVENS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. An unswerving 1960's holdout, Richie Havens is still strumming his guitar with untrammeled momentum, still singing in his grainy baritone and still bringing earnest drama out of protests and stubborn optimism. Tomorrow at 8:15 and 11:15 P.M.; admission is $15 (Pareles).,YUKA HONDA, SEAN LENNON AND FRIENDS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, between Delancey and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. You know this swinging couple has only the best kind of friends. Mr. Lennon composes winsome ballads using the tools of the ultra-modern hipster: traces of lounge music, bubble gum from 1960's France and contemporary Japan, a trace of psychedelia and a current of electronica. His muse and main collaborator, Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto, provides him with charming keyboard sounds and onstage inspiration. Expect much groovy schmoozing this evening, onstage and off. Tonight at 9 and 10:30 P.M.; tickets are $10 (Powers).,* BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUINTET, FEATURING KENNY GARRETT, Iridium, 44 West 63d Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Bobby Hutcherson, the vibraphonist, is one of the great names of jazz to emerge in the 60's, no small feat because of the rarity of masters on his instrument from that time. Check out the reissue of his 1966 album ''Stick Up'' for past glories, but the current focus is ''Skyline'' (Verve), on which he continues to play harmonically complex, focused improvisations with an A-level band (including the pianist Geri Allen, the drummer Al Foster and the alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett). Sets through Sunday are at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M., with midnight sets tonight and tomorrow; cover is $25 (Ben Ratliff).,DAVID KRAKAUER AND GUY KLUCEVSEK, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793. David Krakauer can play refined classical clarinet and wailing, laughing klezmer clarinet and connects klezmer with rock, funk and jazz. In pieces he calls ''Clarinetheater,'' he is to perform backed by electronic samples and, tomorrow night, by the pianist Uri Caine. Guy Klucevsek is an accordion virtuoso who understands that his instrument can be a reed orchestra or an object of amusement. Tonight he performs ''All Accordions All the Time,'' leading an accordion trio; tomorrow night he performs with Alan Bern, the accordionist and keyboardist from the klezmer group Brave Old World. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; tickets are $15 (Pareles).,* KURDISH MUSIC FROM IRAN, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The Kurds are separated by national boundaries that make them a minority in Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Their music is part of the improvisational tradition that stretches across the Middle East, a transparent and impassioned union of melody and rhythm. The musicians in this concert include Ali Akbar Moradi on tanbur, a three-stringed lute; the kamancha (spike fiddle) virtuoso Kayhan Kalhor, and the percussionist Pejman Hadadi. Tonight at 8; tickets are $21 (Pareles).,LINCOLN CENTER JAZZ ORCHESTRA, Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. The big band, led by Wynton Marsalis, has made its reputation playing the works of Duke Ellington. Why change what's working? This concert will feature the conductor and pianist John Lewis, who will run through works taken from one of Ellington's most fertile periods, 1940-1942,  when the band enjoyed the presence of the saxophonist Ben Webster and the bassist Jimmy Blanton. Mr. Lewis and the band will be playing ''Ko-Ko,'' ''Jack the Bear,'' ''Concerto for Cootie'' and others. It's all part of a yearlong celebration commemorating the 100th anniversary of Ellington's birth. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $37.50 (Watrous).,OSCAR NORIEGA QUARTET, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, between Delancey and Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The woodwind player Oscar Noriega is part of a group of busy young improvisers creating the new meaning of ''downtown'' jazz; his band includes the drummer John Hollenbeck, the bassist Stomu Takeishi and the trumpeter Cuong Vu, all remarkably talented players who use humor and intelligence to keep their complex writing afloat. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $8 (Ratliff).,JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 242-1785. The pianist will be making live recordings this week, so you can expect top-level performances. A French pianist who appeared on the New York jazz scene only a few years ago, Mr. Pilc is a remarkably agile pianist in the tradition of splashy stunners that includes Errol Garner and Don Pullen. His trio, with the bassist Francois Moutin and the drummer Ari Hoenig, is well attuned to his quick reflexes and sense of humor. Sets are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. tonight and tomorrow, with a $20 cover and a $10 minimum; on Sunday, sets at 9 and 11:30 P.M., with a $17.50 cover and $10 minimum (Ratliff).,PLASTIC PEOPLE OF THE UNIVERSE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. In Prague in the 1960's, the Plastic People of the Universe transmuted the lessons of Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground into dank, dissonant, precise songs that drew the wrath of Czechoslovakia's Communist Government. The band's persecution helped galvanize a dissident movement that eventually triumphed. But the reconstituted band's songs are more than period pieces; by finding a rock language for Eastern European angst, they turn desperation inside out. Tomorrow and Sunday at 9 P.M.; admission is $12 in advance, $14 at the door (Pareles).,REEL BIG FISH, ZEBRAHEAD, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. The youth of New York will be out in their finest skating and snowboarding gear for this double bill of goofy, beat-happy bands from sunny Orange County, Calif. Reel Big Fish is perhaps the most popular ska band without a giant hit; the group's sense of humor might be judged from the fact that it does a disco version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''There Is Nothin' Like a Dame.'' Zebrahead prefers punk-funk and reggae to ska, but its members have been known to sport two-tone shades. Tonight's show is sold out. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $15 in advance, $16 on the day of show (Powers).,AMY RIGBY, KATE JACOBS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. New York clubgoers had long enjoyed the homey talents of Ms. Rigby as a member of Fish & Roses and the Shams; then she started releasing solo albums and really made her name. Both 1996's ''Diary of a Mod Housewife'' and last year's ''Middlescence'' are cutting and lovable studies of bohemian adulthood in the age of temp work and day care. Her songs strike a common chord, and live she rocks like an old-fashioned tempest. She appears with Kate Jacobs, a local songstress whose quirky, sometimes prim stylings recall Nanci Griffith and Natalie Merchant. The Reachers share the bill. Tonight at 10; tickets are $7 (Powers).,* SEAGULL SCREAMING KISS HER KISS HER, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. This Japanese trio wanders the vast artistic ground between self-conscious cutie-pies like Kahimie Karie and rabid, noise-crazed id-mongers like the Boredoms, making bittersweet pop powered by the unflinching gaze of a strong young woman. Aiha Higurashi founded the group in 1992, then decided she wanted to play louder and revamped it in 1994. It was the right decision: her guitar and singing (mostly in English) deserve the robust support she gets from her bandmates, Takaharu Karashima and Nao Koyama. The name may be a bit clunky, but the sound conjures thoughts of Sleater-Kinney crossed with Lesley Gore. Sharing the bill are Australia's ever-charming Cannanes in duo form, with the locals Harvey Williams and the Pacific Ocean. Tomorrow at 8:30 P.M.; tickets are $8 (Powers).,* SONIC YOUTH AND DAVID S. WARE, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. After compressing its guitar clangor into odd but catchy rock songs, Sonic Youth has lately been letting its music expand again. Its long instrumental stretches ride an inexorable beat through feedback, dissonance, metallic clanks, seesawing glissandos and resonating drones. The music peals and claws and fills a room with hyperactive overtones. Sharing the bill is David S. Ware, a saxophonist who holds on to the swirling, indomitable energy of late-1960's new-thing jazz. He and his group do with acoustic instruments, muscles and breath what Sonic Youth does with electronics, riding  through their own aural whirlwind. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $19.50 (Pareles).,SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY AND GRAHAM PARKER, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Call it rasper's delight: two gravel-voiced singers share a bill. Southside Johnny's band upholds the verities of the Jersey Shore's rock and soul converts. And Graham Parker, once a cantankerous and bilious pub-rocker, is coming to terms with the disappointments and contentments of adulthood. Sunday at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M.; admission is $22.50 (Pareles).,LEW TABACKIN, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. The tenor saxophonist Lew Tabackin has put together a wide-open group that includes the trumpeter Nicholas Payton, along with the bassist Philippe Aertes and the drummer Mark Taylor. Mr. Tabackin is a deeply emotive player, someone who mixes swing and more modern ideas. The shows tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11 P.M.; the cover is $20, with a $10 minimum (Watrous).,TABOU COMBO, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. The band has just released a decent double-CD live album that hints at the intensity of its groove. For 30 years the group has been one of the best dance bands in the New World, which is saying a bit, and given the complexity of the lyrics at their best, it is not just dance music, either. With the drive of each section of the band -- the guitars, the percussion, the choir -- it is hard to suggest exactly where to concentrate; each part offers tremendous pleasure. They will be joined by another popular Haitian band, Zin. Shows tonight start at 11; the cover is $18 (Watrous).,JAMAALADEEN TACUMA, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The bassist came to fame as part of Ornette Coleman's early electric bands. He went out on his own and still plays occasionally. He will be working with the drummer Calvin Weston, who knows his way around funk, and the guitarist Marc Ribot, who knows his way around several styles and can make some noise. The show is advertised as Punk-Funk Harmodelic, which it might well be. Tonight at 9 and 11;  tickets are $12 (Watrous).,SERGIO VARGAS, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. The Dominican singer is host for two nights; tonight he'll be performing with the Colombian salsa band Grupo Niche. Tomorrow night he will be performing with Los Hermanos Rosario, a merengue band and with the Puerto Rican salsa singer Tito Rojas. The shows start at 11 P.M.; tonight the cover is $10 for women and $15 for men. Tomorrow the cover is $20 before 11 P.M. and $30 thereafter (Watrous).,* LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. It is father-daughter night, but don't expect Mr. Wainwright to teach young Martha how to let the man lead when dancing. He is as strong a character as they come, it's true; his songbook is one of the most acerbic and offhandedly wise in the business. But the younger of his two children with Kate McGarrigle has a fierce will and wit of her own. Her songwriting is much more adventurous and vivacious than the average Lilith Fair wannabe, and she's got a voice that deftly gives shape to the thoughts and feelings zooming around inside her. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M.; tickets are $20 (Powers).,JERRY JEFF WALKER, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 544-1666. Jerry Jeff Walker wrote the hit ''Mr. Bojangles,'' but around his home stomping grounds of Texas he's the easygoing, gruffly avuncular icon of the cosmic cowboy mentality, spacing out in the wide open spaces. Tonight and tomorrow at 9, with the Rob Ryan Band opening tonight and Lancaster County Prison tomorrow; tickets are $22.50 (Pareles).,* MATT WILSON QUARTET, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Audiences love Matt Wilson: in his straight-ahead jazz with eccentric twists, he performs melodic ideas on his drum set that imitate something curvy his horn player just played, or he prods his bass player until the interplay turns into a bit of humor. His brain is always working, making the music change slightly as it goes along, and he's easily one of his generation's best drummers. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 9:30; admission is $10 (Ratliff).,STEVE WYNN, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Since his days with the Dream Syndicate, Steve Wynn has been finding a California film-noir angle on two styles forged in New York: the drone and drive of the Velvet Underground and Bob Dylan's metaphysical gamesmanship. Tonight at 9, with Diane Izzo opening at 8; admission is $8 (Pareles).",,"FEB. 26, 1999",POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-505420.html

"Rough weather yesterday took a huge bite out of a potential round-the-world sailing victory for Marc Thiercelin of France. The mast on Thiercelin's 60-foot sailboat, Somewhere, broke in two in 30-knot winds and pounding seas off the southeast coast of Argentina in the Around Alone race.,The gale forced the leading skipper in the race to seek shelter and repairs at Port Stanley, a coastal city about 200 miles away in the Falkland Islands.,At first fearing the worst, race officials diverted Giovanni Soldini of Italy, the second-place skipper, to his aid. Already on board Soldini's 60-foot sailboat, Fila, is Isabelle Autissier, whom Soldini rescued last week from her capsized yacht.,''We polled the fleet right after the news came in to let them know what had happened,'' Pete Dunning, the race coordinator, said yesterday about the nine boats still competing. ''We got a message back from Giovanni that read: 'Received the news of the dismasting. Tell us if you need anything.' '',But later in the day, Thiercelin was able to fashion a jury-rig for his disabled craft and reported that he could proceed on his own. Thiercelin cut his yacht's damaged spar free to prevent it from punching a hole in the hull. With the mayday called off, Soldini resumed racing.,Autissier is prohibited by the single-handed race rules from helping Soldini sail his boat.

"In a case that highlighted the dangers of undercover drug operations and drew calls from the Mayor and the Police Commissioner for the death penalty, a man who took part in a gunfight that killed a detective last year reached a plea agreement yesterday under which he will serve 20 years in prison.,The defendant, Maurice Bolling, 40, had been charged with second-degree murder and attempted murder in the death of Detective Sean Carrington, 28, who was killed in the lobby of a Bronx apartment building when a buy-and-bust operation failed. Jury selection had been scheduled to begin today.,The Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, had accused Mr. Bolling of ''acting in concert'' with Leon Smith, the man who the authorities believe fired the fatal shots. Mr. Smith was killed in the gunfight.,Under yesterday's agreement, Mr. Bolling pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal use of a firearm and waived his right to appeal.,In a statement yesterday, Mr. Johnson said he had agreed to the plea because ''problems with identification of the suspect and other evidentiary issues weakened'' the theory that Mr. Bolling had acted in concert with Mr. Smith. Steven Reed, a spokesman for Mr. Johnson, declined to elaborate.,The statement said that the plea agreement had been reached ''after consulting with the slain officer's mother and the other police officers involved.'',If he had been convicted of second-degree murder and attempted murder for shooting at an officer, Mr. Bolling could have been sentenced to a maximum of 50 years to life in prison. He had also been charged with selling cocaine.,On Jan. 19, 1998, the police said, Detective Carrington and several colleagues had bought cocaine from Mr. Bolling and Mr. Smith in the lobby of 1660 Andrews Avenue in the Morris Heights section. Mr. Smith grew suspicious and shot Detective Carrington three times with a Mac-11 machine pistol, the police said.,A gunfight erupted, and more than 30 shots were fired. Law enforcement officials said days after the killing that Mr. Bolling told detectives he had fired his .25-caliber handgun during the gunfight.,Mr. Johnson has come under fire in the past for not seeking more serious charges in the killings of police officers, including Detective Carrington. After Detective Carrington's death, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir criticized Mr. Johnson for not seeking a first-degree murder charge, which can bring the death penalty.,But such a charge would have required proving that Mr. Bolling knew that the plainclothes detective and his colleagues were police officers, and Mr. Johnson said he did not have that proof. Mr. Bolling told detectives that he did not know that the men were police officers, law enforcement officials said last year.,In a statement last night, Commissioner Safir said, ''Naturally we would have liked to have seen a longer sentence, but 20 years is a substantial amount of time, and at least he will be off the streets.''",AMY WALDMAN,"FEB. 26, 1999",Plea Bargain In Drug Sting That Left Officer Dead,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/plea-bargain-in-drug-sting-that-left-officer-dead.html
"American photographers have not generally had much truck with myth. Myth has never been the camera's primary subject anyway, and this country has no long and indelible tradition that would readily lend itself to philosophical or speculative inquiry under the severe scrutiny of the lens. Native Americans have ancient myths; immigrants (the rest of America) have less to sustain and identify us.,Mesoamerica is different. There, the pre-Hispanic myths are present and visible on monuments and even on live faces that resemble Mayan carvings. Long-gone traditions, even gods, are incorporated into Catholicism in smaller towns and continue to be significant for many who wish to recapture an older cultural identity. And recent photography takes note. Gerardo Suter is a prime example.,An important photographer in Mexico, Mr. Suter has shown often in Mexico City and elsewhere in Latin America since the end of the 1970's but never before in a one-person show in New York. Now there are two exhibitions of his work in town, one of them split between two locations. ''Gerardo Suter: Labyrinth of Memory,'' a traveling show, is the two-part exhibition: 36 black-and-white photographs and a small video projection at the Americas Society, and two large installations at the Sculpture Center. Mary Schneider Enriquez is the curator of the show,  which was organized by the Americas Society, as well as author of an essay in the bilingual catalogue that accompanies it. Throckmorton Fine Art is showing another 12 photographs in ''Gerardo Suter: New Territory.'',Mr. Suter, born in Argentina, moved to Mexico in 1970, and his work is virtually embroiled in the history and myths of ancient Mexico.  His first series of photographs, ''El Archivo Fotografico del Profesor Retus (The Photographic Archive of Professor Retus),'' shown in 1986 and 1987, announced that he was constructing a history. ''Constructing'' is an important word here.  Since the 1960's, Mexican photography had been almost exclusively ''straight,'' unmanipulated, documentary or photojournalistic photography, and Mr. Suter led a new movement that was only grudgingly accepted at first but is now a strong component of contemporary work.,Professor Retus was a fiction whose name was Suter spelled backward, and the archive a sequence of Mr. Suter's own photographs of details of pre-Columbian monuments, doctored in the darkroom to look suitably distressed and old. They were about the search for pre-Hispanic history on two levels: the mystery and power of a culture that, though it has been destroyed, is ever present, and the means by which evaluation of that culture shifted from the European sense that it was merely heathen to the level of study, collecting and tourist attraction.  That shift was accomplished partly through 19th-century archeology and photography, partly perhaps through the romance of everything old, which Mr. Suter's treated photographs craftily mimicked.,His subsequent photographs have  centered on naked human bodies playing out explicit or implicit myths, metaphors or rituals with masks and props, gestures or actions. He reimagines figures like Tlaloc, god of rain and earth, as a nude man in a mask with an enormous eye and an enormous fang, and Coatlicue, that fearsome deity, as a woman holding before her face an image of the skull-like head of the goddess who gave birth to the war god even after she was beheaded by her enemies.,Pictures inspired by ancient codices are of hands with spikes attached to the fingers, heads with mouths forced open by wooden contraptions, bound hands in prayerful attitudes. The references become increasingly arcane, beyond the knowledge of experts but not beyond the imagination and dreams of others, a kind of invented set of Jungian archetypes.,The subject is always presented centrally, up close, with dark, heavy shadows and theatrical lighting -- an iconic, emblematic rendering. At Throckmorton, some of the figures are blurred and elongated, gesturing without the aid of props, perhaps engaged in ritual or transformation. This emphasis on heraldic, iconic compositions, on symmetry, confrontation, proximity and nonspecific but clearly mythical references seems peculiarly Latin American, as in the work of Luis Gonzalez Palma and Mario Cravo Neto. Mr. Suter's photography is bold, cold, wrapped in silence and expectation, charged with menace, mystery, sensuality. In large doses, it can be, for someone who is not fully enmeshed in a culture of myth, a bit overbearing.,And North American history has not generated such a culture, not, at least, one suitable to photography. The Revolution and the Civil War, both fact and myth, were tackled by painters long after the event, but costume dramas dissolve into silliness in photographs and no one has found a universal symbolic form to stand for those wars. The myth of the western frontier is something of an exception, recurring often in action and image and metaphor, in paintings, novels, hundreds of movies, and in landscape photographs by Ansel Adams, photographic advertisements featuring the Marlboro Man and photographs by the likes of Lewis Baltz and Robert Adams that critique the loss of purity in the fabled lands.,The Greek myths and the Bible, the great inheritance of Europeans and Caucasians, have been more easily accommodated by literature, drama and film than by the workaday camera. Moses is simply not a photographic subject, even in symbolic guise. In the 1930's, George Platt Lynes staged a few tableaux based on Greek myths; Sophocles would have shuddered. But more recently, myth has begun to enter the photographic realm in the ethnic search for roots and effort at self definition, as in occasional photographs by Carrie Mae Weems and Albert Chong.,In the last few years Mr. Suter has been moving away from even that kind of myth and away from photography into the territory of mixed media and installation where so many photographic artists are putting down stakes. Some of his largest images are printed on transparent acetate. They cannot be framed, they cannot even be seen without a light behind them and must be suspended from the ceiling: photographs that need light to feed them.,Sometimes he combines them with video or works with video alone, and most recently he has ventured into the ephemeral realm of the Internet.  A small video at the Americas Society, ''Latido (Beat),'' accompanied by a sound rather like a beating heart, tautly combines hope and fear. On a monitor, a rough stretch of dirt seems to breathe in and out. It is quickly revealed to be a man's earth-covered torso as he wipes the dirt off his skin, becomes living and human, then is covered once more, only to unearth himself, only to be covered again, unendingly.,This video is one part of a three-part installation, the largest element of which is at the Sculpture Center.  ''Vientre (Womb)'' is a huge seven-section image on acetate of a naked woman squatting in the birth position with her arms outstretched and her mouth open in a cry. A path of sand with footprints leads toward her groin, while on a monitor a pair of feet repeatedly steps into footprints in sand. This refers to an old manuscript that tells of a sacred cave, the birthplace of a group of indigenous Mexican peoples.,The other installation at the Sculpture Center, ''Stratus I,'' is a video of a naked, kneeling man with hands half clenched up near his shoulders, projected on both sides of a corner of a darkened room above a lighted mound of sand. He leans down to scoop up sand, his hands coming off the wall onto the lighted area, lifts his hands again and lets the sand sift back out of them. This is at first oddly moving, with its implications of time and ritual, but as it repeats over and over and over with only the most minuscule variations, possibly to indicate hopelessness, it verges on something worse in this context: boredom.,In an intelligently argued essay in the catalogue, a Mexican critic, Olivier Debroise, offers the theory, perhaps a little strained but grandly provocative, that Mr. Suter not only skeptically and ironically examines the visual representation of history but also the very possibilities of visual media in general. In light of this idea, Mr. Suter could be viewed as an artist who uses cultural myths to question both the way these myths have been represented and the myths attached to representation itself. This is a fashionable path to follow and not immediately evident in many of the photographs at hand; Mr. Debroise refers to a couple of installations that are not exhibited.,Perhaps the major myth that photographers are dealing with these days is the discredited one that photographs convey reality and truth, and it just may be that art criticism's current major myth, whether right or wrong, is that photographers are more heavily invested in questioning representation than they are in their subjects themselves.,''Gerardo Suter: Labyrinth of Memory'' is at the Americas Society Art Gallery, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, through March 21, and at the Sculpture Center, 167 East 69th Street, Manhattan, through March 20. ''Gerardo Suter: New Territory'' is at Throckmorton Fine Art, 153 East 61st Street, Manhattan, through March 27.",VICKI GOLDBERG,"FEB. 26, 1999",PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; When the So-Called Recorder of Truth Captures Myth,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/arts/photography-review-when-the-so-called-recorder-of-truth-captures-myth.html
"In its shadowy splendor, a photogram's allure has something to do with the magnetism of the mysterious but much more with the alchemy of drawing with light, without benefit of a camera, and using the simplest materials.,The process is deceptively simple. To create a photogram you expose a piece of photosensitive paper to light, leaving on the paper the desired shadows of intervening objects, which can be anything from faces and hands to string and wire mesh. Areas exposed to the light the longest are the blackest; areas where no light has hit the paper are the whitest; and light of varying intensity falling on objects of varying translucency will leave varying shades of gray on the paper.,Among the photographers who explored the enchantment of the photogram in the years before and shortly after World War II were three who became famously associated with it: Christian Schad, who in 1918 was the first to tackle this process seriously in this century; Man Ray, who took up Schad's cameraless technique in 1921 and went on to produce photograms of dazzling inventiveness and artistry, and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, who in the 1920's created luminous architectonic images.,The work of this triumvirate is represented in ''The Photogram 1918-1948,'' at the Ubu Gallery. But the surprise here is in the high caliber and sheer breadth of work produced by about two dozen artists who are little known outside a small circle of cognoscenti.,A few are complete unknowns. In one surviving photogram from the 1930's, with ''Ziubkova'' as the only identifying mark on the back of the image, an entrancing swirl of glowing light descends in ever-widening arcs from the upper-right-hand corner, as though the light were about to swallow up a fly attracted by the motion and the glow.,Movement, in fact, is marvelously suggested in many of the images. In ''Ethereal Opus XI'' (circa 1946-47) by Jean Mowat, an American, a luminescent sphere with whimsical ''ears'' seems to be heading somewhere in outer space. ''Photography,'' by Jane Edwards, is a dreamy composition of gleaming shifting shapes: the pleats of the bellows of a camera, perhaps, behind which is a floating strip of film, these forms juxtaposed with small gray spheres and a white orb. Mowat and Edwards were students in the mid-40's at the Chicago School of Design, which was founded as the New Bauhaus in 1937 by Moholy-Nagy.,Werner Feist, a German student at the Bauhaus in Dessau in the 20's, is represented here by a photogram that appears to have caught a mesmerizing shower of glowing nails and razor blades.,In ''Libelle,'' made in the 30's by Edmund Kesting, an experimental German artist and teacher whose work was included in the 1926 International Exhibition of Modern Art in Brooklyn, a dragonfly hovers tantalizingly above water. Although photograms are generally one of a kind, ''Libelle'' is not. Kesting apparantly made several prints of this image by placing a dragonfly over a slightly out-of-focus negative of water and putting both in the film carrier of the enlarger.,And Frantisek Drtikol, a Czech photographer best known for his studies of the female nude, shows in a 1930 untitled work the hazy forms of a thin woman and her shadow dashing along, arms flying.,Sometimes the photograms tease the subtlest still forms out of the dark. George Zimin, one of the few Russians in the 30's to make photograms, provides the merest hint of circles and crisscrossing lines in a delicate untitled abstraction. A lovely 1939 abstraction by Margaret de Patta, an American who studied with Moholy-Nagy in Chicago, has a black circle outlined in silvery white sprouting a white burst of light, the darkness beyond punctuated by a gray bar.,Sometimes the photograms are energetic still lifes, like the two in the show made in the 40's by Jerzy Kujawski, a Polish surrealist. In one, hand-colored by the artist, oddments of indeterminate origin are artfully thrown together with a small toy baby and what looks to be a pacifier. In another, disordered skeins are poised above a fragment of a negative of a Javanese dancer.,Photograms can resemble abstract etchings, like the two works by Karol Hiller, a Polish artist killed in 1939. Or they may evoke a Miro painting, as in ''Nordisches Marchen'' (circa 1939), by Heinz Hajek-Halke, a German experimental photographer. Or they can look like microscopic studies of organic matter, as in a 1947 untitled work by the Czech surrealist Milos Korececk.,The photographer whose work comes closest to Man Ray's inventive artistry is Arthur Siegel, who was deeply influenced by Moholy-Nagy, whom he met in the 30's. ''Bernard No. 3 Section B'' (circa 1937), is a marvelous assemblage of six profiles of the same man elegantly superimposed over one another in varying shades of white and gray. The companion female Art Deco-ish version, also made around 1937, shows a woman's profile, shoulder and breast duplicated in receding succession in varying grays, the ''spotlight'' on the top half of the face in the foreground.,Photograms are not always about pure esthetics, and this show includes two haunting works produced in the World War II era. One is by David Robbins, who was a member of the Photo League, a New York organization that saw the photograph as a social document. In the Robbins image the skeletal head of a cutout graffitilike figure is detached from its body. To one side is the cutout of a rifle with bayonet. All around are nails and jagged disembodied hands. Offsetting this brutality is a delicate, gauzy piece of fabric in the foreground: a stand-in perhaps for a funeral shroud or for the women who have to bury their men killed at war.,The other wartime work is by the surrealist Jindrich Heisler, who created it in 1944 while hiding from the Nazis in a friend's house in Prague. By stretching glue, Heisler fashioned three spectral figures that appear to be planting flags on alien soil. Behind them is blackness. These stick figures elicit neither terror nor pity but suggest the amazing human capacity to endure and to triumph.,''The Photogram 1918-1948'' remains at the Ubu Gallery, 16 East 78th Street, Manhattan, through March 13.",MARGARETT LOKE,"FEB. 26, 1999",PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; Composing With Light (No Camera Required),https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/arts/photography-review-composing-with-light-no-camera-required.html
"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently made a quiet offer to the Palestinians to carry out a couple of Israel's obligations under the frozen peace agreement signed last fall, but the offer was rebuffed.,Through an Israeli intermediary, Mr. Netanyahu proposed that Israel open up the promised southern safe-passage route between the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza, officials say. And he volunteered to release some Palestinian petty criminals from Israeli jails.,But he made no offer to cede any additional territory in the West Bank. For that reason, the Palestinians did not take the initiative seriously, seeing it as a domestic political gesture on Mr. Netanyahu's part.,''We won't accept partial measures,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian peace negotiator. ''And we won't be brought into the Israeli elections. We urge him: 'Please, leave us alone. We don't want to be dragged into your campaign, for you or against you.' '',Mr. Netanyahu's effort to re-open a conversation with the Palestinians points up once more the clear-cut nexus between the peace effort and domestic Israeli politics. Since Mr. Netanyahu's Government collapsed in December, the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement negotiated at the Wye Plantation in Maryland last October has been shelved in anticipation of the outcome of Israeli elections in late May. Contacts between high-level Israeli and Palestinian officials have ceased.,But Mr. Netanyahu must walk a political tightrope. To keep his right-wing support and win back some of the far right, he must stand tough on his position: Israel cannot comply with the peace agreement because the Palestinians have failed to take the promised steps to fight terror. But to cut into the broad yet elusive center, he would gain by showing a good-faith effort to proceed on the path to peace.,''If the initiative had succeeded, it would have allowed Netanyahu to project both images simultaneously, since there would have been no substantial territorial concession made,'' said David Makovsky, the diplomatic correspondent for the newspaper Haaretz.,David Bar-Illan, Mr. Netanyahu's communications adviser, said Mr. Netanyahu's initiative was not motivated by politics. ''They are interested only in withdrawal,'' he said of the Palestinians. ''They're not interested in letting us look like we're with it, like we have momentum.'',Under the agreement, Israel was supposed to have turned over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians by the end of January, bringing to 40 percent the area under Palestinian control. In turn, the Palestinians were supposed to have cracked down on what the Israelis call ''the terrorist infrastructure.'',The Wye agreement has been a political football since it was signed, well before the volatile election campaign got under way. And Mr. Netanyahu's handling of this ball has worsened tensions with the Americans, who privately and not so privately accuse the Israelis of antagonizing the Palestinians in a way that could backfire on them.,At a forum in Washington this week, Martin S. Indyk, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, offered an unusually public expression of the Clinton Administration's frustration with the Israeli approach. Mr. Indyk, a former Ambassador to Israel, politely upbraided an Israeli diplomat for what he said was misleading the audience about the Palestinians' supposed release from prison of ''known terrorists and murderers.'',''That is not true,'' Mr. Indyk said on Monday at the forum of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. ''They did release people. We checked on it. We checked your information, we checked their information, we had our own information. And it is simply not true.,''They did not release terrorists and murderers.'',In response, the Israeli diplomat,  Lenny Ben-David, backtracked, saying that those released had conspired in terrorist killings, even if they did not directly carry them out. But he distanced himself from the position of his Israeli colleagues.,''Some of you have seen releases from the Israeli Government that accused the Palestinians of releasing killers of Americans,'' Mr. Ben-David said. ''That is a statement I will not make.'',At the forum, Mr. Indyk suggested  that the Israelis use basic psychology in their dealings with them.,''What's the best way to get them to improve their behavior?'' he said. ''Is it to beat on them all the time? Or is it to encourage them? Or is it to build their confidence in your relationship with them?'',Mr. Netanyahu's recent offer was made in the last week or two, apparently by his lawyer, Yitzhak Molcho.  It struck some here as incongruous with Mr. Netanyahu's repeated insistence that the Israelis would do nothing until the Palestinians complied with a host of demands.,''I find this action totally incomprehensible,'' said Mr. Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator. ''Every day, every week, he sends out faxes to CNN, to Reuters, to The New York Times, saying we violated this, we violated that. He is always putting us on the defensive. And, out of nowhere, he offers us one piece of candy? So that he can prove to the center that, what, he's a man of peace?'',Negotiated with President Clinton's direct participation, the Wye accord was supposed to break an 18-month impasse between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But the two sides read the somewhat ambiguous text differently.,In a speech to American Jewish organizations in Jerusalem last week, Mr. Netanyahu said the land-for-security peace plan was structured as a ''sequential'' agreement, in which the Israelis would act only after the Palestinians had complied with their obligations under each phase. But the accord itself speaks of a ''parallel, phased approach,'' and both the Americans and the Palestinians take that to mean that both sides are to act in tandem.,In the first phase, Israel withdrew from 2 percent of the territory under its control, but in the second phase, in December, it suspended withdrawals. Citing everything from hate speech at rallies to inadequate collection of illegal weapons, the Israelis contended that the Palestinians were not waging war on incitement and terror.,In a letter to Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations last week, Israel's delegate, Dore Gold, said Palestinian television ''still attempts to mobilize children for armed conflict.'',The Americans, however, have said that the Palestinians are making concrete strides in their crackdown on terror, while the Israelis have taken no recent steps to comply with their obligations.",DEBORAH SONTAG,"FEB. 26, 1999",Palestinians Reject Netanyahu Offer as Campaign Tactic,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/palestinians-reject-netanyahu-offer-as-campaign-tactic.html
"A Palestinian military court today convicted a Palestinian colonel of raping a 6-year-old boy and sentenced him to death, judicial officials said.,The final decision on whether to carry out the execution rests with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat.,The tribunal, in a single session today, found that the officer, Col.

"''The Lonesome West,'' the latest offering from Martin McDonagh, the 28-year-old Irish playwright, will land on Broadway on April 27, just one day shy of this year's deadline for Tony award nominations.,The play's producer, Randall L. Wreghitt, said on Wednesday that he could not name the theater where the play would run. But he said it would begin previews on April 20 and open a week later. One possible home is the Lyceum, where ''Night Must Fall,'' which opens on March 8, is to end its run in mid-April.,''The Lonesome West,'' the story of feuding Irish brothers, is actually the final part of Mr. McDonagh's ''Leenane Trilogy,'' which begins with ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' currently at the Walter Kerr Theater. The second segment, ''A Skull in Connemara,'' has not yet been produced in the United States. All three are set in the rural town of Leenane. ''The Lonesome West'' includes several characters mentioned in ''Beauty Queen.'',The play, produced in 1997 in London by the Druid Theater Company of Galway, will be directed by the company's artistic director, Garry Hynes, who won a Tony for ''Beauty Queen.'' A cast has not been announced, though producers hope to bring several actors from the original production, pending approval by Actors Equity. ''We felt the time was right to capitalize on Martin's success, on Garry's success and 'Beauty Queen's' success,'' Mr. Wreghitt said.,Ms. Hynes, in a telephone interview from Ireland, said of the play: ''You'll recognize the voice. The characters all live in the same god-awful patch of fictional territory'' as those in ''Beauty Queen.'',''The Lonesome West'' will give Mr. McDonagh another shot at a Tony. Last year, ''Beauty Queen,'' which had been favored to win the award for best play, was upset by ''Art,'' Yasmina Reza's comedy, which is at the Royale Theater.,''The Lonesome West'' enters an already crowded field of straight plays and potential Tony contenders, including several other British imports: ''The Blue Room'' and the soon to open ''Closer,'' ''Amy's View,'' ''Via Dolorosa,'' ''The Weir'' and ''Marlene.'',The other contender will very likely be ''Side Man,'' the sole contestant written by an American, which producers say they are determined to keep open until Tony time, despite lagging ticket sales.,Mr. Wreghitt, who was also a producer on the profitable ''Beauty Queen,'' said he recognized the strength of the spring's competition.,''It's not just a lot of plays -- it's a lot of good plays,'' he said. ''There's not a dog in the bunch.'','Ragtime' in Court,Lawyers for the creative team of ''Ragtime'' are scheduled to appear in Federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday to argue a motion aimed at nudging Livent, the musical's bankrupt producer, into paying $682,487 in fees the artists say they are owed.,The lawyers assert in court documents that the composer Stephen Flaherty, the lyricist Lynn Ahrens and the book writer Terrence McNally are collectively owed $385,748 in salaries, royalties and other fees; the documents also say the choreographer Graciela Daniele is owed $78,105 and the director Frank Galati, $81,173.,Also scheduled to be argued is a claim by E. L. Doctorow, author of the novel ''Ragtime,'' who says he is owed $137,461 from the time before the bankruptcy.,The motions involve mostly payments the artists say they were owed before Nov. 18, 1998, when Livent went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.,Jim Badenhausen, a Livent spokesman, said the company would not comment on the figures.,''Livent has paid and continues to pay all of its obligations incurred since the bankruptcy filing,'' Mr. Badenhausen said. ''However, bankruptcy law prevents Livent from acting upon obligations incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing until the company finishes its reorganization.'',Joshua J. Angel, a lawyer for the creative team, said negotiations were also going on outside the courtroom for settlement of the debts.,Slam Dunk,The director Scott Ellis began rehearsals this week for the Second Stage's revival of ''That Championship Season'' by putting his five-man cast to work on their game.,The 1971 play concerns the reunion of a former champion high school basketball team. The revival stars Dylan Baker, late of the film ''Happiness,'' Ray Baker, James Gammon, Michael O'Keefe and Vyto Ruginis, all of whom are set to suit up today  for a three-hour practice at Xavier High School on West 16th Street. The idea, Mr. Ellis said, is to build camaraderie and skills.,Next week, Mr. Ellis promises to put his team up for a scrimmage game against a yet-to-be determined squad. Any volunteers can call (212) 787-8302.,Casting Scene,Some casting tidbits: First, Mo Gaffney, who plays Swoosie Kurtz's boyfriend (in one role) and her female lover (in another), will leave the cast of ''The Mineola Twins'' at the Roundabout's Laura Pels Theater in March. The reason? Ms. Gaffney is pregnant. Julie Kavner has been mentioned as a replacement.,Lea DeLaria has signed on to replace Becky Ann Baker as Jane in ''The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,'' at the Minetta Lane Theater. Ms. DeLaria, late of ''On the Town,'' begins performances on March 16.,And, third, Anne Pitoniak, who made her name as the mother in '' 'Night, Mother,'' in 1983, will play another mother, in-law, this time, in David Hare's ''Amy's View,'' coming to the Barrymore Theater in April.,Egad!,Here's a trend: Pick a famous historical figure or a classic; add an exclamation point; put on a show. Already seen this season have been ''Eight!,'' about King Henry VIII;  ''Whoa-Jack!'' an adaption of ''Woyzeck,'' and ''Lyz!,'' based on ''Lysistrata'' and presented, no kidding, by a company called Rakka-Thamm!!!,Now comes ''Oh, Coward!,'' running at the Irish Repertory Company; ''Clarence Darrow Tonight!,'' with Laurence Luckinbill, opening at Ensemble Studio Theater on Wednesday, and ''E.E.!'' described as a musical revue of the life of E. E. Cummings, in April at the new Blue Heron Arts Center.

"Much has been made over the years in which Albert Belle has unleashed his wicked bat and vile temper on baseball about his unwillingness to talk to reporters. Belle had a 22-minute conversation with reporters yesterday, but he actually demonstrated his respect for them, or at least for their job, by not talking.,Eight times during the session in the Baltimore Orioles' dugout at Fort Lauderdale Stadium, Belle interrupted his responses to questions with silence while private planes flew overhead after taking off from an adjacent airport.,He could have kept talking, but he knew no one would hear him so he waited until the planes passed, pausing from 6 seconds to 36 seconds in the interest of accommodating the people he sometimes seems to love to hate.,Few people other than reporters care if Belle speaks to them, but when he did talk yesterday, Belle showed a side of himself that fans seldom get to see. Who knew, for instance, that he has a sense of humor?,''A couple years ago,'' he said, discussing fan treatment of him, ''we were home in Chicago playing against the Astros. I guess it must have been a Houston fan. He told me I was one hot dog away from being Cecil Fielder. I got the biggest laugh out of that. I don't know where he got that from.'',Belle actually enjoyed telling the story. He also visibly enjoyed his answers to a couple of questions.,How has he been treated at Camden Yards when he has played against the Orioles there?,''I've been treated there just like I've been treated everywhere else. You got everybody booing for you.'',What's the difference between playing left field, where he has almost always played, and right field, where he will play for the Orioles?,''I got a shorter run in Camden Yards from the dugout to right field. There will be less fans there because of the high wall.'',Belle imparted those lines following his first official spring workout with his new team, the third in his career, the one that lured him during his limited free agency by offering $65 million for five years. The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox were the other teams interested in the highly productive outfielder, who became a free agent because his contract with the Chicago White Sox no longer made him one of baseball's three highest-paid players.,He said the Orioles were his first choice and he had rejected the Yankees and the Red Sox after weighing the ''advantages and disadvantages'' of each team. But here Belle reverted closer to form. When he was asked how close he came to signing with the Yankees before the Orioles jumped in with their offer, he said, ''Let's see. That happened back in 1998 and this is 1999. I pretty much have forgotten what happened in '98, so I couldn't tell you.'',What happened, to refresh his memory, was Belle and his advisers decided Baltimore would be a less threatening place to play than New York. Although Belle has remained out of trouble recently, avoiding off-field encounters like trying to run down Halloween pranksters with his car, he apparently remains susceptible. New York fans have a well earned reputation for making life difficult for players, especially if they falter. Ask Ed Whitson, if anyone can find him.,Belle, whose 313 home runs are the most anyone has hit in the past eight seasons, has been a notoriously slow starter, finding cold weather an environment in which baseball should not be played. Last April and May he hit  10 home runs and drove in 40 runs. He finished the season with 49 and 152. Baltimore, he speculated, should be better for him because the weather should be warmer.,Camden Yards should help, too, because it is a home run park.,''It looks like it should,'' Belle said, ''but that depends on how well the guys around me are performing. If the guys around me get on base and protect me in the lineup, I should have a pretty good season.'',Good enough to hit 70 home runs? ''Everything has to go right for me to hit 50 homers, let alone 70,'' he said.,But, he added later when asked about his image, the better he hits the better his image will be.,''I'm not really concerned about my image right now,'' he said. ''I can't control that anymore. I'm not going to try to. When you win a lot more games than you lose, the image tends to get better. If you hit tons of home runs and drive in tons of runs, the image gets better.'',A few jokes could help, too.",MURRAY CHASS,"FEB. 26, 1999",ON BASEBALL; From Cheeky to Tongue in Cheek,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/sports/on-baseball-from-cheeky-to-tongue-in-cheek.html
"Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today that South Africa should consider a new round of amnesties for apartheid-era human rights violators who had ignored the chance to confess all to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.,The possibility of new amnesties has been rumored for months, since the Truth Commission issued a 3,000-page report on the country's violent past. The report cites evidence that dozens of political leaders from all parties were involved in atrocities.,Many never applied for amnesty, and in theory they are now supposed to be prosecuted. But many South Africans say such trials would be politically divisive and in some cases would lead to more violence, particularly in volatile KwaZulu/Natal.,When the Truth Commission was created in 1995, it was hoped that the vast majority of those guilty of atrocities would come forward, confess their crimes and be given amnesty. This was seen as a compromise, a way to unearth the horrors of the past without the expense and difficulty of Nuremberg-style trials.,Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its history, as sobbing survivors and some of the worst torturers told their stories. But far fewer of the violators came forward than expected. Many simply gambled that cases against them could not be made, or that the country would grow weary of the past and not pursue them.,In a speech to Parliament, Mr. Mbeki, who is virtually assured of becoming South Africa's next President when Nelson Mandela retires this year, said a general amnesty could never be accepted.,But he said specific proposals for amnesties for those involved in the political violence in KwaZulu/Natal and for former generals of the South African Army should be considered, if the country wants to insure peace.,He gave no specifics on how such amnesties would work. Under the Truth Commission, applicants had to tell all and show a political motive for their actions to qualify for amnesty. The commission is still hearing some applications that were submitted before the commission's 1997 deadline, but it is scheduled to finish its work this summer.,Mr. Mbeki's address came as Parliament debated the commission's report and considered its proposals for reparations. President Mandela spoke first, echoing the commission's own proposal that the country fix a time limit on any prosecutions for past atrocities.,''We cannot afford, as a nation and as a Government, to be saddled with unending judicial processes, which can easily bog down our current efforts to resolve problems of the present,'' Mr. Mandela said.,Mr. Mbeki took up different issues. In his speech, he suggested that the Truth Commission's promises to victims would not be kept. The commission had recommended that victims who registered with the commission be given payments of about $1,000 a year for five years.,But officials of the governing African National Congress say the country cannot afford such payments.",SUZANNE DALEY,"FEB. 26, 1999",Official Urges New Amnesty To Erase Scar Of Apartheid,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/official-urges-new-amnesty-to-erase-scar-of-apartheid.html
"They are locked together as a group by the fact that they fired 41 bullets at an unarmed man. But the four police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo may end up employing very different defense strategies, legal experts say.,In their defense, the officers have already said through a union lawyer that they mistakenly thought that Mr. Diallo, a 22-year-old street peddler, was reaching for a weapon, causing them to shoot at him.,But, based on preliminary indications of where the officers were standing when the shooting began, it is unlikely that all four had a clear view of any sudden gestures Mr. Diallo might have made in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.,As a result, while at least one of the officers will likely say he fired because he thought Mr. Diallo was going for a gun, others may well argue that they opened fire largely because they saw a colleague shoot and concluded that he must have been in mortal danger, the legal experts said.,''That is a legitimate argument,'' said Joseph Tacopina, a criminal defense lawyer who often represents police officers. ''When your brother officer releases a round, although you don't see a gun, you don't have time to say, 'Hey, Johnnie. Did you see something?' You have to act instantaneously.'',By making such an argument, the officers would be relying on a section of the New York State Penal Law that allows a person to use deadly physical force if he or she reasonably believes that another person's life is in imminent danger.,''Reasonably'' is the important word in the law: the officers would have to be convincing in arguing that it was reasonable for them to fire, or to fire so many times, at Mr. Diallo  because another officer had begun shooting. Even Police Commissioner Howard Safir has said that the number of shots fired ''on its face, seems excessive.'',Paul Chevigny, a New York University law professor who is the author of ''Edge of the Knife: Police Violence in the Americas'' (1995, New Press), said: ''Does the fact that another cop was firing give the cop a reason to believe that that cop is acting in self-defense or that the suspect is threatening? I don't think it does. The mere fact that someone else is firing by itself is not grounds to open fire.'',Investigators have yet to determine who fired the first shot at Mr. Diallo. But they do have some idea of the circumstances of the shooting. Based on the location of spent bullet shells, investigators think that Officer Sean Carroll was standing alongside Officer Edward McMellon on the outside stairs to Mr. Diallo's building when the shooting began. Both officers fired all 16 rounds from their 9-millimeter semiautomatic weapons. The two other officers, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss, are thought to have been farther back, near the curb, when the shooting began, and they fired four and five shots, respectively.,One factor that could support the idea that the officers thought a colleague was in danger would be whether one of the officers fell during the shooting, creating the misimpression that he had been hit by gunfire. Lawyers who have heard the officers' accounts of the shooting have said that Officer McMellon injured his tailbone when he fell during the encounter with Mr. Diallo.,''If a police officer is working with another police officer and a weapon is fired and one police officer goes down, that is certainly probable cause for an officer to believe he's in danger,'' said Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer for Officer Carroll.,Although there have been previous incidents in which several police officers mistakenly fired at an unarmed person, none of the experts interviewed could recall a case in which officers have argued that they opened fire primarily because they saw a fellow officer begin shooting and felt he was in danger.,But there have been cases in which officers were exonerated in shootings after arguing that they had relied in good faith on bad information from a fellow officer. The most recent example is the case of Kevin Cedeno, a 16-year-old shot to death by Officer Anthony Pellegrini in Washington Heights in 1997. Although the teen-ager was shot in the back, Officer Pellegrini was not charged. He argued that he thought a machete Mr. Cedeno was carrying was really a shotgun, in part because another officer had mistakenly yelled out that Mr. Cedeno had a gun.,Of course, in the Diallo case, none of the possible explanations of why some of the officers joined in the shooting help explain why one officer opened fire to begin with.,All of the officers are awaiting the decision of a Bronx grand jury investigating the shooting, which, if it brings an indictment, will most likely consider charges ranging from second-degree murder to criminally negligent homicide. Mr. Kornberg has already said that he expects his client, Officer Carroll, to be indicted and therefore will not have him testify before the grand jury.,That announcement came as a surprise to the other officers, who have not announced their intentions about testifying, and was another indication that the officers' individual legal concerns might ultimately prod them into divergent legal strategies. The decision on whether to testify may be considerably harder for other officers. One of them, Officer Murphy, who preliminary tests indicate may have missed Mr. Diallo with all four shots he fired, may want to get his side of the story before the grand jury, the experts said.,It is still possible that several of the officers will work out a joint defense agreement, in which their lawyers will coordinate their defense. But it is unlikely that such an agreement would include Mr. Kornberg, who is not being paid by the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, as the three other lawyers are. He has made no secret of his antipathy for the union.,As their individual interests diverge, the officers may find it hard to keep the unified front they have so far, the experts said, especially because they were not regular partners whose friendships helped cement their professional bonds.,If the officers' accounts do begin to differ on important points, several lawyers said that Stephen Worth, the union lawyer who represented all four of the officers until last week, and now represents only Officer McMellon, may have to withdraw from the case because it would be a conflict for him to cross-examine a former client.,Mr. Worth called that suggestion ridiculously premature. ''Neither the Federal authorities or the district attorney have raised that issue with me,'' he said.,Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law who specializes in legal ethics, said a recusal would depend on how dramatically the officers' accounts began to differ.,''If they all hang together, the lawyer has no problem,'' Mr. Gillers said. ''It only arises if there is a rupture between the clients.''",KEVIN FLYNN,"FEB. 26, 1999",Officers in Shooting May Vary Defenses,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/officers-in-shooting-may-vary-defenses.html
"As signs go, it was not a good one.,Striving to bury the biliousness of impeachment, Senators Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, issued press releases early this week announcing a bipartisan ''call for reconciliation.'' All senators were invited to ''pull together and face the future with a collaborative spirit,'' as Mr. Lieberman put it.,But this morning, in a meeting room bulging with gospel singers, ministers, a rabbi and a priest, who all intoned about tolerance, mercy and forgiveness, it was not at all evident that ''the call'' had been heard. There, at the front of the room, sat the attending Senators, all six of them -- three Republicans and three Democrats, although a flash sighting of Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, at the back of the room would bring the count to seven.,Why the low turnout? Could it be, after all is said and done, that the Senate is not so different from the House, where a scheduled retreat on civility and congeniality in Hershey, Pa., has prompted an onslaught of snickers, instead of kisses, and threats of a boycott?,''Oh, God, no,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.,''It's so acrimonious there,'' in the House, he added. ''It's so sad.'',This morning's poor attendance was disappointing, senators said. Those who showed up were the Senators Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii, Charles S. Robb of Virginia and Mr. Dodd, all Democrats, and James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Mr. Ashcroft, all Republicans.,But the meager showing was not a bad sign, many of them said: It simply demonstrated how much progress members had already made in reconciling their differences over impeachment. With all 100 of them thrust together on the Senate floor day after day, senators bonded during the impeachment trial. The House, on the other hand, came unglued, they say.,''This very divisive troubling episode actually united us, as men and women, as individuals who happen to be senators,'' Mr. Lieberman, who is co-chairman of the Center for Jewish and Christian Values with Mr. Brownback, said this morning.,The trial had ''its own salutary benefits,'' Mr. Dodd agreed. ''So it may be that many members felt they had already, in a sense, gone through a reconciliation with each other.'',It is the image of acrimony that the House is trying to buff clean with its annual retreat on civility. This year, though, the retreat has prompted even more eye-rolling than usual. Democrats are not at all keen on the idea, calling it superficial. And some Republicans are not too enthused either.,The House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, said today that he had encouraged Democrats to attend ''this thing in Hershey,'' but he cautioned, ''you only make progress slowly and incrementally.'',Reconciliation between President Clinton and Republicans in Congress may be no less tricky. Mr. Brownback, for one, who voted to convict Mr. Clinton and called for his resignation last year, has invoked a lot of prayers to try to make that happen.,''I had harbored a lot of ill will and dislike and, really, hatred for the President,'' Mr. Brownback said after the meeting. ''I have been praying for him, and that has gone. I have forgiven him, and I hope he forgives me.'',But, in the same breath, Mr. Brownback and other Republicans warned that forgiveness and comity have little to do with policy and legislating. Mr. Brownback said he would turn the other cheek, not give up his backbone, especially over abortion, tax cuts and education.,''Make sure to separate out the difference between reconciliation and genuine policy issues,'' he told reporters. ''I will confront you on policy issues, and I will love you personally.''",LIZETTE ALVAREZ,"FEB. 26, 1999","Of 100 Senators, Only 6 Attend Unity Gathering",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/us/of-100-senators-only-6-attend-unity-gathering.html
"YOU hear often enough about how government couldn't find its way out of a paper bag with a flashlight, how its functions ought to be turned over to private hands. Maybe. But consider this personal tale about a taxi, a wallet and a bank.,The taxi, taken the other day, dropped the fellow off at 10th Avenue and 42d Street. While he paid the fare, absent-mindedness set in. He must have left the wallet on the back seat. How else to explain the horrifying discovery moments later, while crossing the street, that it was gone?,Too late. The cab had taken off.,If this has ever happened to you, you know the agita. Even though the wallet no longer had any cash except a torn $2 bill kept for old times' sake, there were all those credit cards, insurance cards, driver's license, company identification card and who knows what else to replace.,Ah, but there was a cab receipt in hand, giving the medallion number and a city phone number to call in case of a problem: (212) NYC-TAXI. (See? You should listen to Batman and Mr. Moviefone, no matter how much you want to shoot the tape machine with their maddening reminders to take a receipt.),Dialing the phone number led to a city worker who gave her name as Carol -- and who had no idea the caller was a newspaper columnist. She was the soul of helpfulness. And she knew desperation when she heard it.,''Let's relax,'' she said at the start. ''Take a deep breath.'' Then, hoping to lighten the mood as the caller rattled off his losses, she said, ''Hmmm, you sound like a gold or platinum type.'',More to the point, she could tell from the medallion number whose cab it was: the Utica Taxi Center, in Brooklyn. In a flash, the caller was patched through to a woman at Utica named Jackie, who politely took down the information and promised to speak to the driver when he returned at the end of his shift. Since he had no radio or cell phone, there was not much she could do until then, unless he called in.,You discover, when this happens, that you are far from alone. In 1998, the Taxi and Limousine Commission received 57,543 reports of lost property, an average of 158 a day. That is not as high a number as you may think, given that a typical work day produces more than a million yellow cab rides. Still, it's plenty.,The commission does not track how many of these hard-luck stories have happy endings. But there are enough to warrant regular ceremonies to celebrate noble deeds. This month, two drivers, Tahir M. Khan and Pierre Tranchant, were honored for going out of their way to find passengers who had left valuables behind. To boot, they refused rewards.,To get back to this particular wallet, it turned out not to be in the taxi, after all. Its owner must have unwittingly swept it from the back seat to the sidewalk.,THERE it lay until someone picked it up and handed it to Officer Frank Conti of the Port Authority police, on duty at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue, outside the bus terminal. The middle-aged good Samaritan did not give his name, but the officer would say later, ''I got a tourist vibe off him.'',At the time, though, the wallet's owner knew nothing.,He learned what had happened only after finishing his appointment, when he called his message machine at work and heard Officer Conti say he had the wallet. Not only that, but the officer had taken the time to look up the owner's home phone and to leave a message there as well. He then made a detailed list of every item in the wallet.,To cut to the chase, the wallet got back where it belonged within an hour. Nothing was missing. At every step, agents of government had done their jobs with diligence and care.,Now, a few days later, the same fellow had to deal with a major New York bank. Oh, why be coy? It was Chase Manhattan. Someone there had made a bungle of his checking account. It happens.,The point is that he was bounced between useless voice-mail messages. Or he was connected to live humans who proved incompetent or indifferent; one woman all but invited him to take his money elsewhere. This went on for two days. The problem was not fixed until he got through to one Traci McCracken, who was most able and helpful.,But taken as a piece, his mini-adventures left him wondering what the opposite of privatize is? And how do you go about it?",CLYDE HABERMAN,"FEB. 26, 1999","NYC; Sometimes, Government Does It Better",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/nyregion/nyc-sometimes-government-does-it-better.html
"Novell Inc. reported yesterday that its first-quarter earnings had more than doubled relative to a year ago, a performance that just met  analysts' estimates.,The company attributed the improved performance to strong sales of products using its Directory technology, which helps locate multiple users across a network.,Novell reported its results after the market's close, but its shares had gained nearly 10 percent yesterday after Charles Phillips, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, raised his rating on Novell to ''outperform'' from ''neutral.'' Novell shares closed at $20.875, up $1.875, in heavy Nasdaq trading.,Novell's Netware 5.0, which includes the Directory technology, is getting a boost right now because the Microsoft Corporation lacks a competing offering for its Windows NT operating system. Microsoft has promised a comparable feature in the next version of NT, but the new operating system has been delayed repeatedly and is now not expected until next year.,''If you buy into the need for directory services, and you're going to place your bet on Novell or Microsoft, one company has product today and the other one doesn't,'' said Paul Dravis, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ''Is the world all Microsoft, or is the Internet the platform of the future? In that world, Novell has a franchise.'',For the quarter ended Jan. 31, Novell reported earnings of $29 million, or 8 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $14 million, or 4 cents a share, reported in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues rose 13 percent, to $286 million, over the $252 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 1998. Per-share figures reflect a reduction in the number of shares outstanding because of continuing share repurchases.,Novell's earnings matched the consensus estimate, according to First Call, as of yesterday. But until yesterday, when an new analyst added his estimate to the consensus, First Call had been projecting earnings of 9 cents a share.,''We're right on our business plan; this was a very good quarter for us,'' Dennis Rainey, Novell's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. He said sales reflected strong growth in the segments of Novell's business that are directory related, which accounted for 88 percent of total revenue in the quarter. ''What that really reinforces is that companies are stepping up and investing in the directory to manage their global infrastructures,'' Mr. Rainey said.",LAWRENCE M.

"For nearly three seasons with the Rangers, Wayne Gretzky has played every game, sometimes with injuries that might have sidelined other players. But his streak is in jeopardy tonight for a game against the Phoenix Coyotes at Madison Square Garden.,Gretzky missed practice yesterday with a sore neck and underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination. John Rosasco, a Rangers spokesman, said Dr. Patrick O'Leary of Manhattan would study the results this morning and meet with Gretzky.,The pain has been intermittent, Rosasco said, and it became more consistent earlier this week when the Rangers won in Edmonton on Sunday and lost in Calgary on Monday.,The discomfort travels down into one of Gretzky's arms, Rosasco said, making it difficult for Gretzky to handle his stick and shoot. Although Gretzky took pain-killing injections to play with sore ribs a few weeks ago, Rosasco said Gretzky has not done so for the neck injury.,The Rangers, meanwhile, called up Christian Dube, a center, and Scott Fraser, a right wing, to replace Todd Harvey, a right wing who will miss about four weeks to recover from a broken bone in his right thumb. Fraser played 17 games with the Rangers this season, producing two assists. With Hartford, he has 12 goals and 22 assists in 34 games.,Dube, 21 years old, has 15 goals and 26 assists in 48 games with the Wolf Pack. In 27 games with the Rangers in 1996-97, Dube had one goal and one assist. He played last season in Hartford.,The Rangers also hope to get one of their three injured defensemen back. Ulf Samuelsson, who missed most of Monday's game in Calgary with a strained thigh muscle, did not practice Thursday but is expected to play against the Coyotes.,But Jeff Beukeboom and Peter Popovic are still out for at least one more week. Beukeboom is recovering from his second concussion of the season, which he sustained Feb. 12. Popovic has blood in his eye after being hit with a puck Feb. 14.,The Rangers, who have won three of their last five games, are opening a three-game homestand against the Coyotes tonight, Philadelphia on Sunday and Dallas on Tuesday.

Aleksei Kovalev's pass from the left corner to Straka beat Billington, who ventured just outside the crease.,Penguins goalie Tommy Barrasso had 22 saves and Billington, making his second straight start while Patrick Roy recuperates from a groin injury, had 27.,The Penguins have won 12 of their last 15.
