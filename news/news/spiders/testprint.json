But Mr. Lamb\u2019s 627-vote lead Wednesday afternoon appeared insurmountable, given that the four counties in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th district have about 500 provisional, military and other absentee ballots left to count, election officials said.", "That slim margin \u2014 out of almost 230,000 ballots cast in a district that Mr. Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016 \u2014 nonetheless upended the political landscape ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections. It also emboldened Democrats to run maverick campaigns even in deep-red areas where Republicans remain bedeviled by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity.", "Republican officials in Washington said they were likely to demand a recount through litigation, and the National Republican Congressional Committee put out a call for voters to report any irregularities in the balloting. Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the committee, said the party was \u201cnot conceding anything.\u201d", "The battle for a district in suburban and rural areas around Pittsburgh underscored the degree to which Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal has receded across the country. And it exposed the ways in which both parties are weighed down by divisive leaders: Democrats by Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader; Republicans by Mr. Trump and Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House.", "Just as vividly, the race showed that only one party \u2014 the Democrats \u2014 appears willing to grapple with the implications of campaigning under its unpopular figurehead.", "In Pennsylvania, Mr. Lamb, a 33-year-old former prosecutor from a local Democratic dynasty, presented himself as independent-minded and neighborly, vowing early that he would not support Ms. Pelosi to lead House Democrats and playing down his connections to his national party. He echoed traditional Democratic themes about union rights and economic fairness, but took a more conservative position on the hot-button issue of guns.", "Throughout the race, Mr. Lamb said he welcomed support from people who voted for Mr. Trump, and he saved his most blunt criticism for Mr. Ryan, highlighting the speaker\u2019s ambitions to overhaul Social Security and Medicare.", "Mr. Lamb\u2019s approach could become a template for a cluster of more moderate Democrats contesting conservative-leaning seats, in states like Arkansas, Kansas and Utah. Democrats in Washington have focused chiefly on Republican-held seats in the upscale suburbs where Mr. Trump is most intensely disliked.", "But they are hungry for gains across the political map, and in red areas they have encouraged candidates to put local imperatives above fealty to the national party, even tolerating outright disavowals of Ms. Pelosi.", "Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, a Democrat who represents a farm and manufacturing district Mr. Trump narrowly carried, said the party\u2019s recruits should feel free to oppose Ms. Pelosi if they choose. She noted that she was helping one such anti-Pelosi candidate, Paul Davis of Kansas, who was in Washington this week raising money.", "\u201cIf they want somebody else to be a leader, then they ought to express that,\u201d Ms. Bustos said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d", "Representative Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, a veteran Democrat from a neighboring district, said Mr. Lamb had benefited from \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d among Trump supporters and had wisely tailored his message to the conservative-leaning area.", "\u201cThis guy has made a lot of promises that aren\u2019t being kept,\u201d Mr. Doyle said of the president.", "On the Republican side, Mr. Saccone, 60, campaigned chiefly as a stand-in for Mr. Trump, endorsing the president\u2019s agenda from top to bottom. He campaigned extensively with Mr. Trump and members of his administration and relied heavily on campaign spending from outside Republican groups that attempted to make Ms. Pelosi a central voting issue. Conservative outside groups also sought to promote the tax cuts recently enacted by the party, but found that message had little effect.", "Yet the Republicans\u2019 all-hands rescue mission was not enough to salvage Mr. Saccone\u2019s candidacy. Mr. Saccone has not conceded and Republicans have indicated they may challenge the results through litigation, a long-shot strategy.", "In a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday morning, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who leads the party\u2019s campaign committee, described the race as \u201ctoo close to call,\u201d according to a person who heard his presentation.", "But Mr. Ryan and Mr. Stivers also called the election a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Republican lawmakers, telling them that they could not afford to fall behind on fund-raising, as Mr. Saccone did.", "Mr. Lamb raised $3.9 million and spent $3 million, compared with Mr. Saccone\u2019s $900,000 raised and $600,000 spent as of Feb. 21. But Republican outside groups swamped the district. Between conservative \u201csuper PACs\u201d and the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mr. Saccone had more than $14 million spent on his behalf.", "Mr. Lamb got just over $2 million.", "As Republican lawmakers spilled out of their morning conference meeting, few seemed willing to come to grips with how much Mr. Trump is energizing Democrats and turning off independent voters. Some of them even argued that Mr. Saccone had managed to make the race close only thanks to the ", " on Saturday.", "\u201cThe president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,\u201d said Mr. Ryan.", "Others in the conference, however, talked more openly about the political difficulties of breaking with Mr. Trump.", "\u201cThere is no benefit from running away from the president,\u201d said Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, a member of his party\u2019s leadership, noting that Republican candidates need core conservative voters, a constituency that still backs the president, to show up.", "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get them the same thing as Lamb opposing Pelosi,\u201d Mr. McHenry said.", "Even Mr. Stivers, who has the task of re-electing a contingent of lawmakers from districts that backed Hillary Clinton, declined to say Republicans should feel free to break from Mr. Trump.", "\u201cI am not going to tell anybody to be against the president,\u201d he said.", "But turnout levels in the district\u2019s suburban precincts proved crucial for Mr. Lamb, and a handful of Republican House veterans conceded this broader vulnerability.", "\u201cWe know that\u2019s probably where the president\u2019s appeal is the weakest,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime party strategist, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern we\u2019ve seen throughout.\u201d", "But he argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity in high-income areas would be less of a drag on incumbents who had their own identity and were steeled for difficult races.", "Yet even as most Republicans pinned the blame on Mr. Saccone\u2019s fund-raising weakness or held up Mr. Lamb\u2019s willingness to oppose Ms. Pelosi, refusing to fault Mr. Trump, one retiring lawmaker was more blunt.", "\u201cDenial isn\u2019t just a river in Egypt,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a frequent critic of the president. \u201cI\u2019ve been through wave elections before.\u201d", "Democrats were buoyant at Mr. Lamb\u2019s victory, viewing his upset as both a harbinger of a November wave and perhaps a sign that the party had overcome some of the most stinging Republican attack lines of the Obama years. Polling in both parties found Ms. Pelosi widely disliked among voters in the district, but the Republican ads featuring her apparently failed to disqualify Mr. Lamb.", "Mayor Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh, a Democrat, said Mr. Lamb\u2019s campaign showed that the Republicans\u2019 anti-Pelosi playbook had limitations. The race, he said, should embolden Democrats to contest difficult districts in the Midwest with an economic message that appeals to elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s base.", "\u201cConor Lamb was talking about redevelopment and economic growth, and the Republicans were talking about Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they couldn\u2019t help themselves.\u201d", "Mr. Peduto urged the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the electioneering vehicle for House Democrats, to expand its target list in the Trump-aligned Midwest.", "\u201cLook through the Rust Belt, in areas that used to be blue,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a congressional district that\u2019s eight, 10 or 12 points carried by Trump, I would hope that the D.C.C.C. is now putting that in the target.\u201d", "To the extent that Democrats attempt further incursions into Trump country, it may test their party\u2019s willingness to tolerate Lamb-like deviation on matters like gun control, and perhaps more widespread rejection of Ms. Pelosi.", "Democrats in Washington have already faced criticism from liberal activists for intervening in primary elections, in states like Texas and California, to promote candidates that they view as more electable. Putting forward a slate of moderates in Republican areas could prove more controversial than boosting just one in a special election.", "Up to this point, however, Democratic leaders and their campaign tacticians have taken a just-win approach, encouraging candidates to attack Mr. Ryan but taking a far more permissive view of party loyalty than their Republican counterparts.", "Clarke Tucker, a Democratic state legislator in Arkansas who is challenging Representative French Hill, a Republican, said on Wednesday that he took Mr. Lamb\u2019s victory as a validation of a throw-the-bums-out message he planned to deliver in his own race. Campaigning in a seat that includes Little Rock and its suburbs, Mr. Tucker said he seldom spoke about Mr. Trump and announced up front that he would not back Ms. Pelosi.", "Mr. Tucker, who was aggressively recruited by the D.C.C.C., said that he had told Democrats in Washington that he was \u201cvery frustrated with the leadership of the House in both parties\u201d and that no one attempted to dissuade him from delivering that message.", "\u201cThat district is a lot like the one I\u2019m running in,\u201d Mr. Tucker said of Mr. Lamb\u2019s seat. \u201cI think voters are interested in changing the leadership in Washington.\u201d"], "url": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/politics/democrats-republicans-pennsylvania-special-election.html"], "project": ["news"], "spider": ["news"], "server": ["chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box"], "date": ["2018-03-15 20:28:28"]},

In a culture beholden to images, it\u2019s easy to simultaneously embrace and dismiss them as idle provocations. But for all the black garlic in the dough, the kimchi-spiked filling, the blood orange slices mashed on top, they are still viennoiserie, made in accordance with French tradition, precision-engineered with high-grade butter. (Stephen, for instance, is faithful to the revered Beurre d\u2019Isigny, imported from Normandy.) In the croissants and their variations, the layers are as distinct as ribs, from slabs of cold butter immured in fold after fold of dough; the interior resembles a honeycomb of air, due to steam released during baking as the butter slowly melts.", "Some mock these as \u201cFrankenpastries,\u201d a term with echoes of \u201cFrankenfood,\u201d coined in 1992 by an English professor at Boston College expressing dismay over genetically engineered crops. That label is tongue-in-cheek, though just as Mary Shelley\u2019s fevered novel hints at societal fears of miscegenation and \u201cimpurity,\u201d the notion that these baked goods represent unholy unions suggests that there are clear borders in the culinary world that one ought not cross. Two centuries ago, the French led a shift from free-form cooking to codified techniques and built a system for achieving and recognizing mastery that still defines the professional kitchen, pastry or otherwise. So inevitably it\u2019s the croissant that\u2019s seen as being in danger of degradation: the noble, labor-intensive French pastry sullied by its union with the crude, arriviste American doughnut or muffin. (Another iteration was unveiled in January by ", " in San Francisco: the tacro, a savory pork- or chicken-stuffed taco with a croissant shell.)", "YET THE CROISSANT itself was born of crossed borders. The butter-laden layered dough has roots in medieval Arab practice, and the pastry\u2019s shape comes from the Viennese kipferl, said to have been modeled after the Islamic crescent borne on the banners of 17th-century Ottoman invaders. (Although this back story is likely apocryphal, in 2013 a rebel stronghold in Syria banned croissants as symbols of colonialism.) Few dishes, let alone desserts, have remained static over time: Blancmange, a molded milk pudding, was once a chicken casserole; craggy coconut Italian-Jewish macaroons share ancestry (going back to early Sicilian pasta) with the polished round French macarons that have ruffled hems, which languished as solitary disks until someone sandwiched them around ganache a little over a century ago.", "If anything, today\u2019s nouvelle pastries mark a return to the spirit championed by Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, the early 19th-century forefather of French cooking, inventor of the souffl\u00e9 and the croquembouche and architect of monumental confectionery centerpieces that rose up to three feet \u2014 nearly as high as the sculptured hairstyles of his late namesake, Marie Antoinette, the Austrian princess whose own love for viennoiserie may have inspired the myth of her declaring, \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d Car\u00eame has disciples in Paris today, including ", ", known for \u00e9clairs ornamented with edible silver, popcorn and Mona Lisa eyes; ", ", conjurer of macarons that taste like bubble gum; and, of course, ", ", who daubs raspberry-lychee p\u00e2t\u00e9 inside croissants and showers them with candied rose petals. Like the original viennoiserie, which were painstakingly elegant pastries designed for the Hapsburg court in imperial Vienna that eventually became indispensable to the city\u2019s sidewalks, their decadence is matched by the virtuosity of their construction and their element of surprise: They are, then as now, as much for beholding as for eating.", "Their contemporary allure is aided by the diminishment of desserts at midrange restaurants, which after the recession of 2008 began to shed pastry chefs, unable to justify the expense for a course that yields little profit.

WORTH"], "article": ["he V.I.P. terminal of Baghdad International Airport is a clean and quiet place, about a quarter-mile removed from the noise and squalor of the main arrivals-and-departures hall. If you have the right connections and $150 \u2014 American dollars only \u2014 you can wait for your flight in comfort on one of the soft white leather couches, sipping an espresso and getting a close-up view of some of the colorful people who run today\u2019s Middle East. On a typical afternoon, your fellow passengers may include Iranian-trained guerrillas and death-squad veterans who have grown rich on embezzlement. If you stay long enough, gulf oil barons may glide by with their white-robed entourages, perhaps brushing past Iranian Revolutionary Guardsmen in uniform or diplomats from Turkey or Russia, all of them hoping to bully or bribe Iraq\u2019s weak state to their own preferred shape. Everyone is welcome as long as you speak the language of money. On the wall above you are wide-screen TVs and a stylized mural of ancient Iraq, so that you can compare today\u2019s catastrophes with those of yesteryear. Before you leave, a customs official in a dark suit will take your ticket and passport and then return 10 minutes later, smiling obsequiously and extending your stamped documents with both hands.", "But even here, special treatment has its limits. On April 15 last year, a Qatari man arrived in the V.I.P. terminal on an evening flight from his country\u2019s capital city, Doha. After identifying himself as a senior government envoy, he announced that he and his 14 colleagues, all dressed in crisp white ankle-length tunics called thobes, did not want their luggage inspected. The Qataris had brought 23 identical black duffels, a small peninsula of black nylon that covered a sizable portion of the lounge\u2019s hardwood floor. Each bag was so heavy \u2014 well over 100 pounds \u2014 that the porters had trouble rolling them into the room.", "The Iraqis insisted, politely, that all bags must be screened, even in the V.I.P. terminal. The leader of the Qatari team was visibly shocked to hear this. He asked for time. The Qataris huddled for a quiet discussion and then made a number of phone calls. Eventually, they relented and allowed the bags to be screened. Each of them contained stacks of bricklike squares, wrapped in black tape that the scanner could not penetrate. When customs officials asked what was under the tape, the Qataris refused to say. The standoff lasted all night, and finally, near dawn, the exasperated Qataris gave in and drove to Baghdad without their luggage. It was only later that the Iraqis opened the 23 duffels and discovered a mix of dollars and euros, amounting to some $360 million. The bills alone weighed more than 2,500 pounds.", "A week later, the money still impounded, the Qatari team left Baghdad in the same jet that had brought them. They were now accompanied by two dozen Qataris, including members of the ruling Al Thani family, who had been kidnapped during a hunting trip in southern Iraq 16 months earlier. The story of what happened on that trip has not been reported until now. It entails a ransom deal of staggering size and complexity in which the Qataris paid vast sums to terrorists on both sides of the Middle East\u2019s sectarian divide, fueling the region\u2019s spiraling civil wars.", "The cost to Qatar wound up far exceeding $360 million, but ultimately cash was less important than the deal\u2019s political dimension. In order to retrieve its hostages, Qatar was made to negotiate a tightly choreographed population exchange in Syria, using the rebel militias it finances to forcibly uproot every resident of four strategically located towns. The transfers advanced Tehran\u2019s larger goal of transforming Syria \u2014 along with Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen \u2014 into satellite states that will enshrine a dominant Iranian role across the region. The deal was a blow for the Trump administration\u2019s goal of pushing back against Iranian aggression, and for thousands of starving Syrians, it meant being driven into exile by a shadowy agreement, with little say from Syria\u2019s own government. What began as a brazen kidnapping eventually became a measure of the geopolitical forces tearing the Middle East apart, and of their human cost: corruption, sectarian hatred and terrorism. Everyone involved had something to hide \u2014 except, perhaps, the hapless hunters who set it all in motion.", "the houbara bustard \u2014 a bug-eyed, long-legged creature about the size of a large chicken \u2014 is the king of game birds. It is a fast flier with an unusual defense: When cornered, it vomits an oily green substance that can temporarily blind an attacking falcon or hobble its wings. In the days before oil was discovered in the Arabian desert, the houbara\u2019s seasonal return every fall was met with celebratory poetry and long hunts on camelback. The Land Rover made things a lot easier, but chasing the houbara, whose stringy flesh is said to be an aphrodisiac, remains one of the hallowed pursuits \u2014 along with thoroughbred stallions, huge yachts and French chateaus \u2014 that occupy the minds of Persian Gulf royalty.", "In late November 2015, a large group of Qatari falcon hunters left Doha in a column of 4-by-4 vehicles and headed south. Crossing the Saudi border, the convoy turned north, traversing a portion of Kuwait and continuing on to their destination, the southern desert of Iraq, 450 miles from Doha. The group was composed of several dozen people, including servants, and was led by nine members of Qatar\u2019s ruling family, the Al Thanis, one of the wealthiest dynasties on earth. The hunting ground the Qataris had chosen \u2014 Iraq\u2019s Muthanna Province \u2014 has had few visitors since the American invasion of 2003. The desert is littered with cluster bombs and mines left over from three decades of intermittent war. With ISIS reigning across much of the north and undisciplined Shiite militias running rampant elsewhere, Iraq was hardly a desirable tourist destination. But this particular stretch of land, almost devoid of people, had become a seasonal haven for the houbara. The Qataris had heard tantalizing reports about a rebounding population, and despite warnings about the potential for danger, they could not resist the chance. For the next three weeks, the hunters meandered through the desert with their hired Iraqi guards, occasionally doling out extravagant gifts to passing Bedouins to ensure their safety.", "Houbara hunts follow an established daily rhythm. Starting at dawn, trackers and a pack of lean Saluki greyhounds search the dry grasses until they flush a houbara from its roost. The hunters release a trained falcon from its leather jesses, and it takes off in pursuit. High above the desert, the houbara\u2019s slow, powerful wing beats form an eerily graceful counterpoint to the raptor\u2019s fluttering ascents and sudden dives. Once the falcon strikes, the conjoined birds often spiral earthward, trailing intermittent white clouds of the victim\u2019s feathers. Most chases end with the falcon perched atop its prey, sometimes rewarded with the warm brains.", "The hunters had bagged about five houbaras a day, a respectable haul, and by Dec. 15, they were almost ready to return home. That night, as the clear desert air turned bitterly cold, the men warmed themselves around bonfires. Servants bustled around them, grilling a lavish supper and pouring steaming glasses of tea. At about 3 a.m., one member of the hunting party, a 37-year-old Al Thani whom I\u2019ll call Abu Mohammed, was awakened by a servant running into his tent. (He spoke to me on the condition that I not reveal his name.) The servant was terrified. Soldiers were all over the camp, he said. Abu Mohammed got up, dressed quickly and then peeked through the slit between the canvas tent\u2019s flaps. He saw men in uniform and dozens of S.U.V.s and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns. At first, he thought it must be a mix-up, or perhaps a visit by the Iraqi military to warn them about some danger. But within a few minutes, men wearing black balaclavas entered his tent. They were armed with AK-47s. One of them held a clipboard and read out a list of names. He seemed to be looking for the most senior member of the Al Thani family. The gunmen led Abu Mohammed outside into the cold desert air. There, in the glare of headlights, he saw his relatives lying face down on the ground in their long white thobes, their hands cuffed behind them. Men were pointing rifles at their backs. In that instant, he felt certain that their captors were ISIS and soon they would all be killed.", "Abu Mohammed heard a voice from the walkie-talkies carried by the kidnappers: ", " He couldn\u2019t place the accent or determine who these men worked for. They hustled the Qataris into S.U.V.s and blindfolded them. The engines gunned, and they roared off into the desert blackness.", "As soon as the convoy reached a paved road, the captives were hustled out of the S.U.V.s and pushed into vans. They found themselves on the floor, still handcuffed and blindfolded, lurching painfully against other bound bodies every time the speeding van hit a bump. At some point, one kidnapper turned back toward the hostages and began saying crude and insulting things about Aisha, the third wife of the Prophet Muhammad. In the Arab world, this sort of insult is a dead giveaway. Sunnis revere Aisha, but Shiites revile her as a traitor who fought against Ali, the foundational figure of Shiite tradition. Abu Mohammed and his fellow hostages instantly understood they were in the hands of Shiite militiamen, not ISIS or any other jihadi group.", "After three or four hours of driving, the vans stopped. They could hear jets taking off and landing and the sound of soldiers\u2019 voices in unison. But in addition to military orders and salutes, they heard voices chanting \u201cYa Hussein!\u201d \u2014 a Shiite slogan. The captives couldn\u2019t place their location, but they were most likely on the edge of Tallil air base near Nasiriya, one of the largest military installations in southern Iraq. In the strange tug of war that typifies today\u2019s Iraq, the country\u2019s military \u2014 trained and supported by the United States \u2014 operates literally side by side with Shiite militias backed by Iran. The captives were held on the base for several days, then blindfolded again and driven to a house, where they were locked in basement cells.", "At one point, Abu Mohammed \u2014 hoping to work this out Qatari-style \u2014 pulled out his wallet. (The kidnappers had already taken all their cellphones and tossed them out the windows during the drive.) He had about 120,000 Qatari riyals inside, roughly equivalent to $33,000. \u201cWe can pay,\u201d he said. Other hostages had more with them; the total, he said, was probably equal to several hundred thousand dollars, if not more. The lead kidnapper looked unimpressed. \u201cYou think we want your money?\u201d he said.", " first reached Qatar at about 6 a.m., spreading a chain of panicked phone calls through the government and the royal family. The news underscored the vulnerabilities that have come with Qatar\u2019s sudden rise to prominence. A tiny, thumb-shaped peninsula jutting into the Persian Gulf, Qatar has catapulted from poverty to immense wealth in just the past three decades, thanks to natural-gas deposits under its desert and coastline. It is a country with a G.D.P. of $181 billion but only around 300,000 citizens, about the same size as Pittsburgh. It sits between the region\u2019s great Shiite power \u2014 Iran, just across the water \u2014 and its most influential Sunni state, Saudi Arabia. Starting in the 1990s, Qatar tried to protect itself by aggressively courting and irritating all sides at once. It made overtures to Syria, Iran and Hezbollah, the region\u2019s rising \u201cShiite axis,\u201d angering both the Saudis and the United States. At the same time, it also reached out to other Sunni countries, using its endless money to broker diplomatic deals in Lebanon and Yemen. It birthed Al Jazeera, the gadfly satellite channel that pleased crowds with its anti-American broadcasts, even as Qatar continued to host the largest American military base in the Middle East.", "But in recent years, Qatar\u2019s balancing act has backfired badly. As the Arab Spring uprisings broke out in 2011, Qatar bankrolled the Muslim Brotherhood across the region, seeing it as a sympathetic force for Sunni populism in an increasingly democratic era. That infuriated the Saudis and Emiratis, who \u2014 though Sunni, like the Brotherhood \u2014 consider the group a threat to their own autocratic model. Qatar made another risky bet by financing Sunni rebel factions in Syria (including the local branch of Al Qaeda), hoping they would win the civil war and show gratitude to their sponsors. Instead, the Syrian war dragged on, the rebels grew more extreme and Qatar was tainted by its association with terrorist groups. In the end, Qatar managed to make enemies on both sides of the worsening sectarian divide.", "Within days of the hunters\u2019 kidnapping, the Qatari government determined that the royals were almost certainly being held by a Shiite militia with ties to Iran. That effectively put their fate in the hands of a man who is perhaps the most powerful military officer in the Middle East: an Iranian general named Qassim Suleimani. An austere, hollow-eyed commander, Suleimani controls the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, along with a far-flung network of proxy forces and allies across the region. He reports directly to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is widely considered a more influential figure than the country\u2019s foreign minister or president. He has directed Iran\u2019s successful efforts to disrupt American policy in Iraq since the U.S. invasion in 2003; a 2012 magazine profile in Wired called him \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous\u201d man.", "Suleimani appeared to have little interest in ransom money. His top priority for years had been Syria, where Iran has fought hard to prop up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Syria has been a lifeline for Iran ever since the 1980s, when the new Islamic republic first began shipping weapons through Syrian territory to Hezbollah, which functions as Iran\u2019s external arm in Lebanon. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, that link was suddenly at risk. The region\u2019s great Sunni and Shiite powers leapt into the Syria crisis, transforming the democratic stirrings of the Arab Spring into a sectarian battleground. For the Saudis and their allies, sponsoring Syrian rebels was a golden chance to topple Assad, push Syria onto the Sunni side of the chessboard and isolate Iran. For Suleimani, who directed Iran\u2019s military forces in Syria, the civil war there became an existential struggle to sustain his country\u2019s only reliable ally.", "The Qatari hostages were suddenly valuable pawns in this geopolitical game. Qatar had powerful leverage with the rebel factions it is believed to finance, leverage that could be useful to a strategist like Suleimani. His approach in Syria had shifted as the war ground toward a bloody stalemate. By 2015, Suleimani and his Hezbollah allies were looking for new ways to consolidate control over certain key areas near the Syrian capital: not just killing rebel fighters but expelling the Sunni civilian population that sustained and protected them. Ultimately, they hoped to repopulate those towns with less rebellious Shiite residents. It was a controversial and ambitious scheme, with dark overtones of ethnic cleansing. But if it worked, it could entrench Iranian influence in Syria for the long term.", "Just before the Qatari hostages were taken, Iran had begun a bold effort to make this demographic transfer happen. At a secret meeting in Istanbul facilitated by the United Nations in September 2015, an envoy from Suleimani\u2019s Quds Force proposed a symmetrical agreement that came to be known as the \u201cfour-towns deal.\u201d Hezbollah would end its siege of two Sunni rebel strongholds in Syria near the Lebanese border, Madaya and Zabadani, whose residents posed a continuing threat to the Assad regime in Damascus. In exchange, the Qatari-funded rebels would end their siege of two Shiite towns in the northwest, Fua and Kefraya. The four-towns deal would accomplish two goals for Iran: clearing out the rebel threat in a strategic area, while rescuing the imperiled Shiites up north, whose plight had been a persistent rallying cry with Hezbollah\u2019s Shiite base.", "The details of the deal were vague at first, but at some point the Iranians even suggested that the residents could swap towns, with Sunni and Shiite Syrians literally trading places, perhaps inhabiting one another\u2019s homes. They presented this as a humanitarian gesture: Ending the two sieges would benefit people in all four towns. But the rebel spokesmen in Istanbul angrily rejected the whole idea, calling it an arrogant effort to reshape Syria\u2019s natural patchwork of diverse religions and ethnic groups with a crude sectarian calculus.", "With the kidnapped Qatari hunters, Iran acquired some very powerful leverage over those same rebels \u2014 or rather, over their chief benefactor in Doha. The plan for evacuating the four towns, left for dead after the talks in Istanbul, was back on the table.", " take long for Suleimani\u2019s proxies to spell all this out to the Qatari government. As their messenger, they used Hezbollah, the only group with trusted links to all the parties involved: Tehran, Doha and the Shiite militia that held the hostages in Iraq. Working through Hezbollah also allowed Iran to maintain some control over the ransom negotiations, which might otherwise have ended in a fast cash payment for the Iraqi kidnappers. Instead, Hezbollah sent a high-ranking emissary to Doha and made the conditions very clear: The captives would be freed in exchange for Qatar\u2019s help in making the four-towns deal happen.", "The Qataris, less interested in the larger implications of the deal than the well-being of the royals, readily agreed to host a long series of talks involving the various parties to the four-towns deal: Hezbollah, the Iranians and the rebel militias. Tempting as it is to imagine these figures grouped around a table, they appear to have met separately with their Qatari interlocutors. Much of the negotiation hinged on logistics. Moving civilians in a fast-shifting war zone is not an easy business, and there were many differences to be worked out. Some of the rebel militias were fiercely opposed to the idea of a population transfer, and the Syrian regime \u2014 which was not party to the deal \u2014 was not keen on it either. The plan to exchange the four towns\u2019 Shiite and Sunni residents was abandoned as too ambitious; instead, they were to be moved to safe zones, with each town\u2019s future to be worked out separately. But that alone required some coordination among armed factions on opposing sides of the war. Money played a large role in smoothing out all these kinks. The Qataris\u2019 Sunni rebel allies were not going to advance an Iranian scheme for nothing.", "But as the months wore on, there was still no timeline on freeing the hostages. The Qataris grew desperate and wondered if the Iranians would ever deliver. They began exploring other avenues, and a parade of dubious middlemen came to Doha offering rescue schemes in exchange for huge cash payouts. One of the Qatari officials I spoke to seemed sheepishly amused by the raft of shady offers that came in. \u201cI remember one Iranian guy said: \u2018I can get them out for $20 million,\u2019\u2009\u201d the official said. A member of the Qatari ruling family paid $2 million to a firm called the Global Strategies Council, which is run by a Greek shoe salesman. None of it was useful. The Qataris got so frustrated, one former diplomat in Doha told me, that they considered a drastic solution: a military raid to free the captives. Qatar almost certainly lacked the know-how to pull it off. But the very fact that it was discussed suggests that the emir was under tremendous pressure from his small, clan-oriented population to bring the hostages home.", "It took almost 16 months for the Qataris to finally find the man with the right clout and connections to close the deal. It happened in early April 2017, during the annual gathering of Arab interior ministers, held that year in Tunis. The Qatari minister was introduced to his Iraqi counterpart, Qassim al-Araji, a man with deep ties in the Shiite-militia world. Al-Araji, a square-faced 54-year-old, spent many years in exile in Iran and was twice imprisoned by American forces in Iraq a decade ago on suspicion of smuggling and distributing weapons to be used in attacking American troops. (He was released for lack of evidence.)", "Al-Araji said he knew who had the hostages, though he did not name the group. As it turned out, it was Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, a Shiite faction formed in Iraq more than a decade ago that has mounted hundreds of attacks on American soldiers and was trained, funded and supervised by Iran\u2019s Quds Force. Al-Araji said he had a plan for freeing the hostages, according to a high-ranking Qatari official who recounted the conversation to me. But the plan came with an unusual condition. Al-Araji wanted authority to mediate the release personally, and he hinted that his Qatari counterpart should say nothing about the matter to anyone else in the Iraqi government, where sectarian and political divides create competing agendas. The Qatari agreed.", "Money was part of the agreement, a kind of sweetener to be added to the four-towns deal. The Qatari official who described the meeting to me told me as much, and he went on to say that the money was meant to finance a new port and embassy in Baghdad. He looked so uncomfortable as he said it \u2014 his face hovering somewhere between a wink and a blush \u2014 that I didn\u2019t have the heart to say the obvious: that this was a painfully transparent cover story for an all-cash ransom payment.", "A week later, the Qatari negotiating team arrived in Baghdad with its 23 bags. They soon found that Qassim al-Araji had wildly oversold his power over the Iraqi government (and the Baghdad airport). In Baghdad, I saw photographs taken that night showing the blocked-out bricks of cash on the scanning machine and the angry Qataris standing in the V.I.P. lounge, surrounded by black duffel bags. When Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, found out what the Qataris were up to, he was furious and decided to draw a defiant line in the sand for Iran and its proxies. He sent an armed counterterrorism team to guard the 23 bags of cash and make sure no one could spirit them off to the kidnappers. After the Qatari team finally gave up and made its way to Baghdad, Abadi eventually had the money transferred to a vault in Iraq\u2019s Central Bank.", "The Qataris were driven from the airport straight to Baghdad\u2019s secured Green Zone, where they were being put up, by previous arrangement, at the guesthouse of Prime Minister Abadi \u2014 the same man who had just impounded their $360 million.", " to derail a deal that had been carefully plotted during months of meetings in Doha. The 23 bags of cash were supposed to be delivered at the same time that Qatar\u2019s rebel allies were executing the terms of the four-towns deal. That very day, Sunni militiamen were reluctantly shepherding Shiite civilians onto green buses and traveling with them on the road to Aleppo, where they were to be housed with the help of the Syrian regime. In parallel, 200 miles south, Hezbollah fighters were preparing to escort thousands of people out of Madaya and Zabadani.", "The $360 million was not the only money at stake. To secure their support for the population transfers, Qatar had paid the Sunni militias \u2014 Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham \u2014 at least $50 million, I was told by a senior Iraqi official and by people close to the rebel groups.", "The Qatari envoys spent much of their first day in Baghdad working the phones on two fronts. They had to monitor the ongoing civilian transfers in Syria, and they were desperate to recover their 23 bags of cash. They enlisted everyone they knew in Iraq to help, including the Shiite militias. They bolstered their pleas, several Iraqi officials told me, with a shameless campaign of bribery that would last a week, offering huge sums of money and luxury apartments in Doha and Dubai to officers, cabinet members and lawmakers. None of this succeeded in getting the $360 million away from Abadi and his circles of allies.", "Before the end of the day, something happened that cast a sickening new light onto the cold calculations surrounding the four-towns deal. At about 3:30 p.m., a line of buses carrying civilians away from the two Shiite towns, Fua and Kefraya, stopped at a checkpoint in an area called Rashideen, just west of Aleppo. A dark blue Hyundai Porter truck pulled up and parked next to one of the buses. Moments later, it exploded.", "The blast was unusually powerful. Images from the scene show a green-and-white bus, its windows blown out and its innards blackened by fire. All told, 126 people were killed in the blast, mostly civilian evacuees, including 68 children. Hundreds were injured. No one knows for certain who carried it out, but everyone I spoke to believed the bombing was intended to stop the four-towns deal, which was seen by many rebels and jihadi groups as a gift to Iran.", "The images of the fire-blackened bus were a savage reminder that the four-towns deal was not just about back-room negotiations and bags of cash. The families on those convoys had been forced to leave their homes. The Qatari officials I spoke to believed they were taking part in a humanitarian rescue for victims of a siege, and some members of Ahrar al-Sham, the rebel group, told me the same thing. But many Syrians saw the transfers for what they were \u2014 forcible exile, to suit a scheme cooked up by foreigners \u2014 and were furious. This was especially true of those in the Sunni towns, Madaya and Zabadani. Most of the residents were reluctant to leave even after years of a siege that left hundreds dead from starvation and Hezbollah snipers.", "I spoke by video chat with a civilian named Ali Saeed who reluctantly fled from Madaya. He is 52, a small but squarely built man with a fleshy nose, close-cut hair and a look of stubborn defiance stamped on his face. He told me that Hezbollah\u2019s siege of Madaya had turned the town into a virtual concentration camp. \u201cFirst people ate through their reserves of dry food,\u201d he told me. \u201cThen they began eating leaves and grass.\u201d Ali Saeed held his cellphone up to the camera to show me photos of his children, one of whom fell on his head while running from a sniper and died soon afterward.", "But it was the arrogance of the transfer scheme that consumed him during our call. After he learned about the four-towns deal, he confronted a Hezbollah commander at a checkpoint just outside Madaya. \u201cI was upset,\u201d Ali Saeed told me. \u201cI said, \u2018You are coming here to displace us, to dominate our land.\u2019 The Hezbollah officer told me, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree to leave, you can starve.\u2019\u2009\u201d", " resumed despite the bombing, and within a few days the four-towns deal was largely complete. One night, around the same time, the Qatari negotiating team in Baghdad slipped out of the Green Zone in an S.U.V. They changed cars repeatedly in a vain effort to avoid drawing the attention of Iraqi officials and ended up at a rendezvous with a Shiite militia in the Karada neighborhood. At their meeting, the Qataris were shown a proof of life \u2014 a recent video of the hostages. Then, abruptly, the Qatari team began packing their bags and asked their hosts for permission to leave the country. The 23 bags were still sitting in an Iraqi bank vault, but it seemed that the Qataris had somehow found another way to satisfy the kidnappers\u2019 demands.", "Almost immediately, at the basement prison south of Baghdad, Abu Mohammed and the other members of the Qatari ruling family got a thrilling surprise from their guards: They would be receiving showers and haircuts. It was time to go. They were led upstairs and into the sunlight, their eyes smarting from the glare. They had spent 16 months in a windowless basement in southern Iraq, a few hours\u2019 drive from where they were kidnapped. Their meager prison diet had left them weak. They had spent the first half of their ordeal entirely cut off from the world, with only a single Quran to read. Later, the guard had given them a TV, and watching the news, they had seen reports about a political deal that was said to be brewing in Syria, involving hostages and population exchanges. \u201cWe suspected this was connected to us,\u201d Abu Mohammed told me.", "The men were led outside and driven for two hours to a house on what looked like an opulent private ranch. Inside, waiting in a large reception room, were the nonroyal hostages, who had been held in a separate location. The men embraced and wept, and began trading stories. To their surprise, they discovered that the other group \u2014 apparently seen as blameless in their country\u2019s policies \u2014 had been treated much better than the Al Thanis during their captivity, with adequate food, showers and respectful guards.", "For the next two days, the Al Thanis were once again addressed like royalty. Servants came and went, addressing them with elaborate courtesy. Meals were laid out.

One night they were served an entire spit-roasted sheep. Their attendants repeatedly addressed them as \u201cour guests\u201d and apologized for their earlier mistreatment. On the morning of April 21, the Qatari hostages were driven to Baghdad and given a farewell reception at the Intelligence Ministry before their trip to the airport.", "Abu Mohammed told me that he and the other hostages feared some kind of snag right to the very end. \u201cWe felt complete relief only when the plane took off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a dream. A feeling of joy.\u201d The two-hour flight to Doha was full of giddy laughter. The men\u2019s relatives were waiting in the airport when the flight arrived that evening. Their joy was tempered by shock at the men\u2019s condition: They were gaunt and hollow-eyed. Abu Mohammed had lost 40 pounds. But the emir of Qatar was there, too, and he kissed them all, with tears in his eyes, as they stepped off the plane.", "obvious mystery in the case of the kidnapped Qataris. How, with the $360 million impounded, were the hostages released? One senior Iraqi official gave me the following answer: The Qataris agreed to provide another delivery of cash, via Beirut, of roughly the same amount. (It was Qassim Suleimani himself, I was told by another official, who made the final call to release the hostages.) As far as the location for a money drop goes, this makes sense: Hezbollah maintains a firm control over the Beirut airport, and it would have no trouble ensuring that the cash would pass through. If this is true, it would bring the total amount Qatar paid for its hostages to at least $770 million, and probably substantially more. I heard reports of several other multimillion-dollar payouts to various middlemen that I was unable to confirm. There is also the $2 million that an Al Thani family member paid to the Greek shoe salesman, and the bribes the Qatari envoys supposedly paid during their week in Baghdad. It is easy to imagine a total approaching $1 billion.", "Qatari officials deny making any payments apart from the cash in the 23 bags. They continue to insist that the money was intended solely for the Iraqi government, for various investments in Iraq and for \u201chelp in facilitating the release of the Qatari hostages.\u201d When I asked why the kidnappers went ahead with the release even after their $360 million payment was impounded, a Qatari official suggested (not very persuasively) that the cash was never that important.", "Almost a year later, the effects of the Qatari ransom deal can still be felt, from Doha to Washington. The four towns in Syria are mostly empty \u2014 a few hundred stubborn people cling to their homes in the Shiite towns up north, and some remain in Madaya and Zabadani. The jihadi rebels in Syria also continue their battle, yielding a steady trickle of battlefield death and dismemberment. The deal appears to have deepened the divide between the rebels and the people they claim to represent. Ali Saeed, the exile from Madaya I spoke with, told me that the rebel militias\u2019 participation in a scheme to force people from their homes was a cowardly betrayal of the revolution against Assad. \u201cMay God destroy them,\u201d he said.", "But the ransom deal\u2019s heaviest legacy may be back home in the gulf. The Saudis and Emiratis, who had long resented Qatar\u2019s sponsorship of the Muslim Brotherhood, were infuriated by the reports of heavy payments to Shiite militias. On June 5, they initiated a full-scale economic blockade. They issued a draconian list of demands, including the closing of Al Jazeera and a Turkish military facility, and financial reparations for years of supposed wrongs. Although the blockade had been talked about for months, the ransom deal provided a useful pretext.", "The ransom also began to figure, often in highly distorted form, in a Saudi-financed P.R. blitz that portrayed Qatar as a fountainhead of terrorism. The anti-Qatar campaign was a patchwork of true and false or questionable claims that only muddied the waters around the ransom and Qatar\u2019s broader culpability in bankrolling Islamist groups. But it seems to have been effective with one very important audience: Donald Trump. Even as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson struggled to mend the rift between America\u2019s partners in the gulf, Trump undermined him in very public fashion, making clear that he sided entirely with his new Saudi friends. (Trump had been treated to a fawning reception during a visit to Riyadh in May, sword-dancing with the king and appearing in a photo-op with a bizarre glowing orb that generated an endless series of conspiracy theories.) Tillerson grew so frustrated with the interference of Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that he reportedly threatened to resign later in the summer, and had to be coaxed to stay by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, now the White House chief of staff. Tillerson tried again to end the blockade during another visit to the gulf in October, but he got no further.", "How much of the blame does Qatar deserve for all this wreckage? It has been involved in multimillion-dollar ransoms to free Al Qaeda captives before, including a Swiss woman held in Yemen in 2013. My friend Theo Padnos, who wrote about his two-year kidnapping ordeal in Syria for this magazine, was freed through Qatari mediation and possibly Qatari money. If the Qataris did pay nearly $400 million to Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah (a group that is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization), it would put a lot more blood on their hands. Furthermore, if the money was paid via Beirut, it is fair to assume that Hezbollah (also listed as a terrorist group) received a cut. The $50 million paid to Jabhat al-Nusra (yet another group on the terror list) and Ahrar al-Sham is also troubling, despite the fact that those groups now pose a threat mostly to the Assad regime and its allies and not to the West.", "But in the end, it seems as if the Qataris were less villains than dupes, drunk on natural-gas money and blind to its fatal consequences. They threw cash around in clumsy efforts to manipulate the politics of a volatile region, only to find the tables turned. One Qatari official who worked on the kidnapping told me, with a plaintive look in his eyes: \u201cPeople accuse us of working with Hezbollah \u2014 but look what they did to us!\u201d", " final mystery, at least for me, was its origin: Why did the hunters go to southern Iraq in the first place? They knew how dangerous it was. A big group like theirs, handing out gifts of cash to local Bedouins and camping in ostentatious luxury, was ludicrously easy pickings for a Shiite militia. The hunters had been warned about this from the beginning, even by their own government. The last warning came only a day or so before the kidnapping, when Qatari security officials discovered that a mysterious Iraqi blogger had posted the hunters\u2019 GPS coordinates online.", "When I spoke to Abu Mohammed, he confirmed that they had been profusely warned. \u201cBefore the trip, everyone said \u2018You\u2019re crazy, don\u2019t go\u2019 \u2014 my mother, my friends, my brothers,\u201d he said.", "Why take the risk? I asked Abu Mohammed this in a ", ", the reception hall of a home that belongs to his uncle in Doha. A row of thronelike yellow chairs sat empty in the long, silent room, where a single server came periodically to refill our tea glasses. It is very rare for Western journalists to meet with members of the Al Thani family outside the context of a government interview. Qataris have a reputation for privacy and reserve, and in more than a decade of visiting Doha I have never once been inside a Qatari home. Their reverence for decorum is visible in their quiet manners and in the way they walk \u2014 a floating motion that foreigners often remark on. Abu Mohammed\u2019s bearing was poised and erect, and he scarcely moved during our entire talk, which lasted almost three hours.", "Abu Mohammed paused before answering my question, and then began explaining what falconry means to people of his generation. \u201cYou are away from phones, from business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are with nature. You feel free.\u201d And, he added, there was a deep cultural pull to consider. He looked toward the windows, where we could see the edges of Doha\u2019s hypermodern sprawl, studded with oblong skyscrapers and cavernous malls. When Abu Mohammed was born, in 1978, none of that existed. Photos from the time show a blank desert coastline with a cluster of shabby-looking buildings on its edge, the remnants of Qatar\u2019s days as a remote pearl-diving outpost. By the time he reached adulthood, money from natural gas had transformed Qatar inside and out. Its citizens are vastly outnumbered in their own country by foreign workers, and their culture \u2014 once rooted in thrift and self-reliance \u2014 is unrecognizable. Starvation has given way to obesity. Families routinely complain that their young men are adrift in a world of limitless consumption and pleasure. Many are able to buy Lamborghinis but unable to hold down a steady job.", "Falconry, Abu Mohammed seemed to be saying, is a remedy for the gulf\u2019s oil curse. Training a raptor can be a solitary, obsessive enterprise, enforcing a measure of self-discipline that is often lacking in such men\u2019s lives. There are many hours of patient habituation and repetitious work with glove and lure that form a bond between bird and human: ", " master falconers like to say. All this elicits passionate, even fanatical devotion. Risks are easily brushed aside. Money \u2014 even vast sums of money \u2014 seems meaningless. Abu Mohammed told me he was already planning trips to the desert to hunt the houbara again, despite the danger.", "\u201cFalconry is addictive like a drug,\u201d he said, adding, with a subtle smile: \u201cIt\u2019s the sport of kings.\u201d"], "url": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/magazine/how-a-ransom-for-royal-falconers-reshaped-the-middle-east.html"], "project": ["news"], "spider": ["news"], "server": ["chriss-MacBook-Pro.fritz.box"], "date": ["2018-03-15 20:28:29"]},

Too far down.

From his room at rehab, Alan sees the spires of the college campus where he teaches: \u201cTowers above the trees across the river reminded him he was University Professor Severance not the craven drunk Alan S who had been told by an orderly that his room smelled like a farmyard.\u201d At rehab, Severance is constantly reaching for the part of himself capable of something besides self-concern: \u201cHis own hope was to forget about himself and think about the others.\u201d The novel is all about the world of rehab \u2014 its linoleum floors, cafeteria food and daily mundanity \u2014 but it\u2019s ultimately about these", " and what it might mean to think about them. A woman named Arabella tells the group that she hasn\u2019t wanted to do anything but scream for years. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember a time when you didn\u2019t have it?\u201d her counselor asks, and she replies, \u201cDrinking sends it away.\u201d", "The core question of \u201cRecovery\u201d is whether something else might send it away instead.

But in truth I was also looking for something much simpler: company in the struggle \u2014 not just the struggle to live without alcohol but the struggle to find a voice that didn\u2019t depend on its thrall. In those early days of sobriety, when I first read Charles Jackson\u2019s 1944 best seller \u201cThe Lost Weekend,\u201d a tragicomic account of a single extended bender, I found myself torn between rooting for its antihero, an aspiring writer named Don Birnam, to get sober and wanting him to find a way to keep drinking. Reading the novel illuminated my own deep ambivalence about booze: how much relief I felt at stopping, how thirsty I still felt.", "Jackson\u2019s reputation was largely based on that novel, which the director Billy Wilder turned into an Oscar-winning film the following year. The book was revolutionary for its time, in its willingness to portray alcoholism as a state of merciless dependence rather than a metaphysical state illuminated by the sepia-tones of tragic myth, as Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Faulkner, the holy trinity of modernist drunks, had done half a generation earlier. \u201cThe Lost Weekend\u201d was a critical and commercial hit, selling almost a million copies over the course of Jackson\u2019s lifetime. But it frustrated Jackson that its success meant his reputation became so inextricably entwined with alcoholism.", "For decades, Jackson wanted to write the story of his drunk hero once he\u2019d left his lost weekends behind him. But he was perpetually stymied by that hypothetical book, tentatively titled \u201cWhat Happened\u201d; his biographer, Blake Bailey, has observed that Jackson was a master of \u201cworking on every conceivable thing but ", " novel.\u201d In the months after Jackson began attending A.A. in 1953, however, he was finally able to generate about 150 pages, presenting a more stable vision of his drunk antihero. He wrote to a friend: \u201cIt\u2019s far & away the best thing I\u2019ve done, simpler, more honest, and, for the first time, ", " of myself \u2014 that is, not self-tortured or -absorbed or -eviscerated.\u201d", "The novel was anchored in the ordinary texture of a sober alcoholic\u2019s daily experience. \u201cI can put it best,\u201d Jackson told his editor, Roger Straus, \u201cby saying that the story ", " is happening \u2014 taking place, like daily living \u2014 on every page.\u201d Jackson wanted to believe his novel could be wondrous in its attention to ordinary human life. But he was also worried. In letters to friends, he openly confessed his anxiety that this approach could seem marked by a \u201ctotal lack of originality\u201d \u2014 the very lack of originality that A.A. was teaching him to embrace. How could he write a novel that would succeed according to the very different standards set by the spheres of literature and recovery?", "Jackson never finished \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d When I finally read the unpublished manuscript at his archives in New Hampshire, I brought so much desire with me \u2014 to see the fruits of his sober creativity, to see proof that sober creativity was possible \u2014 but found only pages of turgid, convoluted narrative. \u201cI can only write the human, meanderingly,\u201d Jackson had written to a friend, confessing his fears about his long-awaited epic, and reading his pages I started to understand what he meant. I\u2019d been glued to \u201cThe Lost Weekend,\u201d unable to put it down, and I wanted \u201cWhat Happened\u201d to be like that, but it wasn\u2019t. Mostly, it was hopelessly abstract:", "What life means, it came to him (or he seemed to overhear it), it means ", " the time, not just at isolated dramatic moments that never happened. If life means anything at all, it means whatever it means every hour, every minute, through any episode big or small, if only one has the awareness to sense it ... each step, the dramatic and the humdrum alike \u2014 every fleeting second of the way.", "The thing was, I actually agreed with what Jackson was saying. I\u2019d come to believe that life happened every hour, every minute; that it wasn\u2019t made of dramatic climaxes so much as quiet effort and continuous presence. But I could also see how Jackson\u2019s desperate desire to deploy his recovery wisdom had crippled his story. His own words about the book now played back to me like an omen: \u201cwith scarcely any \u2018plot\u2019 but much character. ... I\u2019m proud to be so objective & detached, ", "The manuscript bore out some of my worst fears about sobriety: that it was destined to force you into a state of plotless tedium, a string of empty evenings, a life lit by the sallow fluorescence of church-basement bromides rather than the glow of dive-bar-neon escapades. I was afraid that loving the drunk story best meant some part of me still wanted to keep living it. And of course, some part of me did.", " my second sobriety \u2014 the sobriety I\u2019m still inside of, seven years and counting \u2014 I stopped going to meetings and found myself wanting deeply to drink. I\u2019d just moved back to the New England college town where I\u2019d spent several years drinking heavily, and all the old bars made me nostalgic. I remembered their crushed peanut shells and vodka specials, the sweet blur of that nightly surrender. The shimmering alternate world in which I decided to drink again grew close once more. It lay just beyond the drudgework of recanting: ", " Then I\u2019d be back in the sweet autumnal swirl of red wine and hard cider, the chilled salt slide of dirty martinis. It would be like finally crawling back under the covers on a cold morning.", "That\u2019s when I found \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d David Foster Wallace\u2019s novel didn\u2019t exactly lead me back to meetings, though I did return to them, but it helped me understand why I needed them. More specific, it helped me understand that certain things about meetings could drive me crazy and that I could ", " need them. The novel had metabolized recovery with so much rigor that it had already asked all my questions and weathered all my intellectual discomforts. It documented what Wallace called the \u201cgrudging move toward maybe acknowledging that this unromantic, unhip, clich\u00e9d A.A. thing \u2014 so unlikely and unpromising ... this goofy slapdash anarchic system of low-rent gatherings and corny slogans and saccharine grins and hideous coffee\u201d might actually offer hope, in its simplicity and its slogans, in its church-basement coffee and its effusion of anonymous and unqualified love.", "While Berryman and Jackson understood the project of writing sobriety in terms of deprivation \u2014 denying themselves the luxuries of plot and stylistic adornment, eschewing the momentous for the plain-spoken \u2014 Wallace wrote recovery with an exuberant excess. \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is full of humor and wild imagination \u2014 giant feral hamsters roaming the land, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois-separatist assassins in wheelchairs \u2014 and its vision of recovery is similarly full of earnest absurdity: grown men crawling across cheap carpeting with teddy bears tucked into the crooks of their arms, sober folk struggling with \u201cpastry dependence\u201d or a man in rehab killing alley cats to get a sense of \u201cresolution.\u201d \u201cSerious AAs look like these weird combinations of Gandhi and Mr. Rogers,\u201d the novel observes, \u201cwith tattoos and enlarged livers and no teeth.\u201d", "If I\u2019d read \u201cThe Lost Weekend\u201d rooting for Don Birnam to get drunk again, I read \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d rooting for Don Gately \u2014 one of Wallace\u2019s protagonists, a beleaguered halfway-house counselor \u2014 to stay sober. Gately describes the newly sober as \u201cso desperate to escape their own interior\u201d that they want \u201cto lay responsibility for themselves at the feet of something as seductive and consuming as their former friend the Substance.\u201d I wanted to lay myself at the feet of the book that told me that.", "Wallace himself went to a Boston rehab called Granada House in late 1989, seven years before \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d was published and nearly 20 years before his suicide in 2008. In his 2012 biography of Wallace, \u201cEvery Love Story Is a Ghost Story,\u201d D.T. Max argues that Wallace quickly understood the ways that recovery was also a \u201cliterary opportunity.\u201d He credits recovery as part of Wallace\u2019s growing commitment to \u201csingle-entendre writing, writing that meant what it said.\u201d Recovery shifted Wallace\u2019s whole notion of what writing could do, what purpose it might serve \u2014 made him want to dramatize the saving alchemy of community, the transformative force of outward-facing attention, the possibilities of simplicity as an alternative to the clever alibis of complexity. (The rehab staff, he wrote in an anonymous online testimonial often attributed to him, recognized his \u201cmeaningless intellectualization as a way of evading terrible truths.\u201d) I\u2019d been so afraid of sobriety as a flatline, as Jackson had been afraid of sobriety as a flatline, as Berryman and Johnson and maybe the older waitress sitting at the Tuesday-morning meeting had been afraid of sobriety as a flatline. I\u2019d been afraid that meetings were basically lobotomies served alongside coffee-flavored water and Chips Ahoy!; afraid that even if sobriety could offer stability and sincerity and maybe even salvation, it could never be a story. But \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d knew better. It wasn\u2019t that the novel\u2019s brilliance survived the deadening force of sobriety. Its brilliance depended on what sobriety had wrought.", " I got sober, I found myself teaching Denis Johnson\u2019s stories to a classroom of college students in Connecticut: another circle of chairs full of people listening to tales of drugged-out misadventure. My students seemed unspeakably cool \u2014 they spent their weekends finding their spirit animals and doing drugs I\u2019d never heard of \u2014 and I was desperate to earn their affection. On the first day of class, I brought two dozen doughnuts and a cardboard box of coffee, and then I kept bringing them each week, afraid that if I stopped, the students would be disappointed. When we read Johnson\u2019s stories about barflies and hallucinated visions, I could see myself a decade earlier, convinced that these fever dreams had a monopoly on creative brilliance, these farmhouses full of pharmaceutical opium and outdoor movie screens lit by the gigantic faces of angels. I asked the class if they had a favorite story from the collection. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s no right answer.\u201d", "But I was lying. There was a right answer.

I read it \u2014 once, twice, three times \u2014 while they quietly swept up their doughnut crumbs. ", " Every voice I\u2019d ever heard in meetings echoed in that closing line. Maybe some of my students found it sappy or maudlin, that sense of belonging, but my heart swelled righteously against their imagined accusations. The story believed in something besides the self-immolating antics of dysfunction \u2014 their flickering, intoxicating glow. It was gazing somewhere beyond the horizon, past the blaze.", "Johnson, who died last year, first tried to dry out in 1978, in his parents\u2019 home in Tucson, where he was living with his eccentric grandmother Mimi, but he didn\u2019t get sober for good until the early 1980s. \u201cI was addicted to everything,\u201d he said decades later. \u201cNow I just drink a lot of coffee.\u201d At first Johnson was \u201cconcerned about getting sober,\u201d and knew this was \u201ctypical of people who feel artistic.\u201d But he wrote only two stories and a few dozen poems in 10 years while he was actively using, so he figured he didn\u2019t have much to lose.

It was the mid-1970s, a time of liberation and experiment, but the sexual revolution, it seemed, had yet to reach the English countryside.", "\u201cAny particular girlfriends at the moment, old boy?\u201d Hollinghurst\u2019s father asked him.", "\u201cNo, Dad,\u201d he replied. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cNot really interested, are you?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think so.\u201d", "And that was that.", "\u201cIt was clear he got the picture and didn\u2019t feel it needed to be talked about,\u201d Hollinghurst, who is now 63, told me recently at his home in northwest London. It\u2019s possible that family discussion of the matter would have been suspended indefinitely had Hollinghurst not gone on to publish a series of revelatory novels about gay life in England. When his debut, \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library,\u201d appeared in 1988, two decades after the decriminalization of homosexuality, openly gay characters and the raucous milieu they inhabited remained almost wholly absent from English fiction, to say nothing of English culture at large. The novel, which instantly secured Hollinghurst\u2019s reputation, not only brought into the light \u201cthings best covered by darkness,\u201d as its promiscuous young narrator, William Beckwith, says; it did so with a stylistic prowess and attentive rigor that made previous writers of sexually explicit fiction, gay and straight alike, look squeamish and incurious by comparison.", "Will\u2019s voice in \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library,\u201d ornately seamed with mischievous wit and wordplay, bears the imprint of the gay writing Hollinghurst consumed as a young man, even as it draws upon a resource unavailable to earlier generations: unabashed sexual truth-telling. During a virtuosic description of foreplay with a man he has just picked up, Will notes his new lover\u2019s \u201cdeeply beautiful, creamily smooth\u201d buttocks, \u201ccubic with built muscle,\u201d as well as the man\u2019s smell \u2014 \u201ca soft stench like stale flower-water.\u201d Hollinghurst\u2019s nimble, richly textured prose, which lavishes as much attention on a pretentious \u201csteel-framed building, tarted up with niches and pilasters like some bald fact inexpertly disguised\u201d as an erection passing along a line of men in a public shower \u201cwith the foolish perfection of a Busby Berkeley routine,\u201d doesn\u2019t so much shift between registers as void any such distinction. This is a writer for whom sex and fine art, sensual and aesthetic bliss, are not categorically discrete activities but points along a spectrum of delight.", "The novel appeared the same year that Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government, in response to growing public hysteria about AIDS, passed a bill prohibiting local councils and publicly funded schools from \u201cpromoting homosexuality.\u201d Seen by some as doing exactly that, \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library\u201d achieved a notoriety uncommon for a work of literary fiction and became a best seller.", "\u201cWish fulfillment,\u201d Hollinghurst replied, not altogether persuasively, when I asked him what resources he drew on to create the character of Will, a handsome aristocrat who lives a life consecrated to pleasure. \u201cHe was someone richer, more glamorous than me. And he was having a lot more sex.\u201d We were sitting on the sofa in Hollinghurst\u2019s light-soaked living room, which looks out over the sloping fields of Parliament Hill, at the bottom of Hampstead Heath. Quick, low clouds were scudding across the rectangle of sky framed by the window opposite us; whenever Hollinghurst turned his head to mull something I asked, the view flashed in miniature across his rectangular spectacles. With his close-cropped silver hair, gnomish goatee and general air of placid competence, he could have been an actuary or an I.T. manager \u2014 that is, until he opened his mouth. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a model, particularly,\u201d Hollinghurst said, and his voice, implausibly deep, sonorously patrician, seemed to come from another time; it would probably have sounded on the antique side at Oxford High Table in the mid-1950s, when he was born. \u201cBy then I\u2019d seen quite a lot of handsome, self-confident, sort of public-school types, so it wasn\u2019t a huge stretch.\u201d", "In \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library,\u201d Will is tasked with writing the biography of one Charles Nantwich, an octogenarian peer whose life he saves one morning while out cruising in a public lavatory. \u201cI\u2019m always forgetting how sexy the past must have been,\u201d Will remarks after reading the diaries that Nantwich turns over to him, which reveal a very different kind of gay existence from his own, one haunted by the specters of legal punishment and reputational annihilation, and yet not without its adventures and satisfactions.", "The past is everywhere present in Hollinghurst\u2019s work. In a sense, his entire career has been an attempt to recover a lost \u2014 indeed, an actively suppressed \u2014 gay cultural heritage. Sex is a way into history for Hollinghurst precisely because it is something historians tend to neglect, and nothing is more appealing to the novelistic imagination than a blank. His latest book, \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair,\u201d which came out in England in October and has just been published in the United States, is a work of characteristic subtlety and forthrightness. It traces the shifting social identities available to gay people in Britain over the past 75 years while insisting on leaving as many blanks as it fills in.", "Like \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library,\u201d the new novel trains its sights on the divergent fortunes of two men who come of age on either side of the 1967 Sexual Offenses Act, though in this case the two men are father and son. David Sparsholt, a member of the R.A.F. who is decorated for his heroics in World War II, presents as a conventional family man until a liaison with a male politician turns him into a household name. Johnny, David\u2019s only child, is 14 when the life-wrecking scandal embroils his father in 1966, but he already knows that his erotic preference is for boys. Blessed with better historical luck, Johnny must nevertheless contend with the indelible mark of his surname and the inscrutable family history that comes with it. Late in the new book, a middle-aged Johnny, who has become a successful portrait painter, contemplates his father\u2019s reluctance to visit him and his partner at their home in London, which he chalks up to \u201cthe irreducible fact that Johnny was doing openly what for David had been a matter of secrecy and then of very public shame.\u201d", "Such an irreducible fact might have served as the basis for mutual compassion and understanding, but this is a novel about the failure of cultural transmission, about stalled emotion and stymied confidences \u2014 in short, about being English. For Hollinghurst, writing about gay life has always also been a way of writing about the society that constrains and proscribes it. Magnetized by the establishment, he brings an outsider\u2019s clinical perspective to its manners and customs and the psychological toll they can inflict. \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d may be his most harrowing damage report yet.", "\u201cContemporary life doesn\u2019t suggest stories to me in quite the same way as the past,\u201d Hollinghurst said, folding one leg over the other and leaning back so that I got a better view of the painting to his right, a nocturnal scene of boats on the Thames by the artist Walter Greaves, a student of Whistler\u2019s who, after being reduced to poverty late in life, was said to use the stretcher bars of his canvases for firewood. The walls were covered with paintings in carved and gilded wooden frames \u2014 the fruit of a collecting habit that Hollinghurst acquired after his fourth novel, \u201cThe Line of Beauty,\u201d won the Man Booker Prize in 2004. At the slightest prompting, he would begin unfolding the stories behind each item with the effortless fluency of a docent. \u201cContemporary life doesn\u2019t have the things I find most interesting,\u201d he continued. \u201cSecrecy, concealment, danger.\u201d", " early life would seem to have predisposed him for the role of epochal silence breaker. An only child, he was born in the small market town of Stroud in 1954. His parents were Churchill-worshiping Conservatives. At the time, daily existence was still permeated by the war. Rationing ended a few weeks after his birth, but because many people who had been called up continued to use military titles in civilian life, Hollinghurst spent his childhood referring to neighbors and family friends as \u201cMajor This\u201d and \u201cWing Commander That.\u201d To keep him in line, his father would sometimes bark at him in a parody of military drill. (\u201cStand up straight, boy!\u201d Hollinghurst said in a booming, somewhat camp disciplinarian voice, recalling the routine. \u201cPut your shoulders back!\u201d) At the nearby all-boys boarding school to which he was sent at age 7, he was studious and well behaved, terrified of being punished by the masters. It was there that he discovered Wagner, the English poets and, a few years later, with the onset of puberty, a keen interest in his fellow schoolmates.", "Like olive oil or color TV, open homosexuals were not a feature of this straitened world; it wasn\u2019t until Hollinghurst went to Oxford to read English in 1972 that he encountered his first unmistakably gay person. As a graduate student in the late 1970s, he took up the newly permissible project of constructing a gay canon. He read \u201cSexual Heretics\u201d (1970), the groundbreaking anthology of gay Victorian writing, and Aleister Crowley\u2019s \u201cWhite Stains\u201d (1898), a volume of erotic verse that had to be published abroad under a pseudonym, in Oxford\u2019s Bodleian Library. \u201cThere was so little material in those days, so I was rather turned on by this sort of terrible gay pornography,\u201d he told me. His thesis, by contrast, a study of \u201cthe creative uses of homosexuality\u201d in the novels of Ronald Firbank, E.M. Forster and L.P. Hartley, sought to elucidate \u201cthe stimulating effects of constraint.\u201d", "During his time in graduate school, Hollinghurst paid intermittent visits to London, where, in his words, \u201cthe gaying up of Soho\u201d was well underway. The dazzling world of bars and clubs and public cruising spots of which he caught a glimpse stood in bracing contrast to Oxford, with its dour emotional atmosphere of thwarted longing and romantic starvation. (There was a gay social club at his Oxford college, Hollinghurst told me, but \u201cthe other members didn\u2019t necessarily make you keen to join it.\u201d) When he moved to the city for good in 1981 and took a job as an editor at The Times Literary Supplement, he embarked on a process of euphoric discovery. \u201cThe whole idea of London became sexualized for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just seemed it would be very interesting to try and capture some of that on the page.\u201d", "On Jan. 1, 1984, Hollinghurst sat down to begin writing \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library.\u201d Conscious of several previous novels he failed to finish, he\u2019d recently acquired a yearlong desk diary and set himself the goal \u2014 a kind of New Year\u2019s resolution \u2014 of filling up a page a day. Although he didn\u2019t quite maintain this pace, he was several chapters in and feeling good about his progress when, in November, he received shattering news. Nicholas Clark, a close friend from Oxford who introduced him to London\u2019s gay scene, had died suddenly. It had been clear for months that Clark was unwell; he always seemed to have a cold, and once, after he cut himself shaving, his face was swollen for weeks. AIDS was still little understood \u2014 it was something going on, or so Hollinghurst and other members of England\u2019s gay community liked to tell themselves, elsewhere: i.e., America.", "Clark was one of the first people in England to succumb to the disease, and his death signified a rupture with all that had gone before. The unexplored world that Hollinghurst had set out to chronicle was itself being radically transformed before his eyes. As he pressed ahead, he was confronted with the question of whether to incorporate this changed reality into his novel. He considered having Will, stricken with AIDS, narrate the entire book on his deathbed, or using a framing device in which the book is presented as being transcribed from posthumously discovered tapes. Finally he decided that any such gesture would be surplus to requirements. History didn\u2019t need to be wedged into the book; the book was already inevitably permeated by it. Four years later, when \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library\u201d was published to critical and popular acclaim, the summer of 1983, during which much of the novel takes place, had acquired a similar poignancy to the summer of 1913.", "When the English writer Geoff Dyer read the book shortly after it was published, it made him realize how \u201ctimorous and discreet\u201d his own debut novel, \u201cThe Colour of Memory\u201d (1989), had been. \u201cI became interested in seeing to what extent one could do a heterosexual equivalent,\u201d he said on the phone. Garth Greenwell, whose celebrated debut novel, \u201cWhat Belongs to You\u201d (2016), drew comparisons with Hollinghurst, told me in an email that \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library\u201d gave him \u201can immense sense of permission\u201d when he discovered it at age 20 in 1998. \u201cThere was a great liberating thrill in reading, at that time when there was so much pressure to conform to a politics of respectability, a book that was so unapologetic in its representation of men having sex \u2014 pleasurably, promiscuously \u2014 with other men. It felt radical in its indifference to the moral judgments of straight people.\u201d", "\u201cThere was a need to do something defiant,\u201d Hollinghurst said of the reactionary political climate in which his first novel was written and published. \u201c\u2009\u2018The Sparsholt Affair\u2019 has come out into a world that\u2019s so different.\u201d This new world \u2014 in which gay rights are increasingly recognized and sexual truth-telling is ubiquitous \u2014 is one that Hollinghurst played his part in creating. What kind of literature it might demand is a question that \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d tries to answer.", "The novel opens one evening during the Blitz in the autumn of 1940, \u201cin that brief time between sunset and the blackout when you could still see into other people\u2019s rooms.\u201d A group of male students at Christ Church College, Oxford, has gathered in a dormitory to discuss literary matters. The conversation is quickly derailed, however, when one of them, Evert Dax, who is gay, spots a handsome young man in a singlet lifting weights in a room across the quad. They gather around to admire this alluring new figure, who, they soon learn, is in trouble with the college authorities for the \u201crhythmical creaking\u201d that has been coming from his room. For Evert, \u201ca strictly raised boy in an unusually good suit who seemed to gaze at pleasure as at the far bank of a river,\u201d an erotic obsession is born. Its object, the young David Sparsholt, is already engaged to his boyhood sweetheart, but by the end of term he and Evert will have slept together. It is a powerful sequence, as good as anything Hollinghurst has written, made all the more thrilling by the sexual invigilation to which the characters are subject.", "Whatever the affair with Evert may mean to him (it is never made clear), David goes on to marry his fianc\u00e9e and procreate; the next time we see him, it is through the eyes of his 14-year-old son. Johnny inherits a world of sexual freedom inconceivable to his father, sleeping with numerous men before finally settling down in his 50s (and then getting back in the game once again after his longtime partner dies). While most of Hollinghurst\u2019s previous books ended on a note of poignant suspension, abbreviating the lives of his young protagonists, \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d keeps on going, skipping over decades as it closes in on the present. During that time, we witness the growing normalization and acceptance of gay people, relatively new terrain for Hollinghurst. The scandal that upended David\u2019s life and continues to haunt his son\u2019s comes to seem ever more cruel and benighted, the relic of a culture now receding into history.", "Yet this isn\u2019t a story of straightforward progress and liberation; Hollinghurst knows that the present is never as enlightened as it likes to think it is, nor the past quite as backward. \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d opens in a world in which private life is fiercely inspected and surveilled; by the end, that world has given way to one in which private life is turned inside out and posted online for all to see. Toward the end of the book, a recently widowed Johnny is on a date with Michael, a young man he has met online. They begin to fool around, though Michael seems to be more interested in showing Johnny amateur porn on his laptop than in having actual sex with him. Through Johnny\u2019s eyes we witness an inventive but, it seems, rather joyless act of self-stimulation: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t remotely the sort of thing he was used to looking at, and he was giddy for a moment at the sequence of casual revelations, that people did this, and that they filmed it, and that others watched it.\u201d", "Like the window through which Evert and his friends first see David Sparsholt, the browser window on Michael\u2019s computer frames an object of male desire, though this one is rather less enticing. If \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d shows how society has been transformed by sexual liberation, a process with its roots in people\u2019s innermost desires, it also shows how people\u2019s innermost desires have in turn been conditioned by a transformed society. Baring all, the novel suggests of our present moment, may not be the best way to hold an admirer\u2019s \u2014 or a reader\u2019s \u2014 attention.", " in \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library\u201d and beyond, has been to speak in a voice steeped in English heritage about a subculture that England\u2019s rigid and stratified society long refused to acknowledge, let alone accept. Naturally, such audacity has met with its detractors. When Hollinghurst\u2019s third novel, \u201cThe Spell,\u201d a game of amorous musical chairs involving four gay men of differing ages and a good deal of MDMA, appeared in 1998, its lack of interest in history, gay or otherwise, was perceived by many critics as a slackening of moral seriousness.", "One of the most disparaging voices was that of John Updike, who, in a review for The New Yorker, complained that Hollinghurst\u2019s novels were \u201crelentlessly gay.\u201d After a while, he wrote, the (presumably straight) reader begins \u201cto long for the chirp and swing and civilizing animation of a female character.\u201d For Updike, even subpar novels of heterosexual coupling still concerned themselves with \u201cthe perpetuation of the species and the ancient, sacralized structures of the family,\u201d and thereby possessed a certain inherent interest; in \u201cThe Spell,\u201d by contrast, \u201cnothing is at stake but self-gratification.\u201d", "Implicit in this critique is the notion that to write about gay life is necessarily to limit oneself as a novelist. Updike had this exactly backward. For Hollinghurst, homosexuality is a democratizing force; it brings people together across boundaries of race and class and age. Had he been straight, his social canvas would have been restricted immeasurably. As Geoff Dyer told me, \u201cHe could\u2019ve ended up just reinventing some literary wheel if he\u2019d been a heterosexual, comedy-of-manners novelist with a more than passing fondness for toffs.\u201d", "Nowhere is Hollinghurst\u2019s breadth and range more evident than in \u201cThe Line of Beauty,\u201d the novel in which he finally addressed the subject of AIDS head on. The book\u2019s protagonist is Nick Guest, a graduate student from a solid if unglamorous middle-class background who is lodging with the family of his Oxford friend Toby Fedden, the object of an unvoiced crush. It is 1983, Margaret Thatcher is prime minister and Toby\u2019s father, Gerald, is a newly elected member of the ruling Conservative Party. Nick, who has recently come out, divides his time between the elite world of the Fedden family, with its black-tie dinners and country-house weekends, and the gay underground of pre-AIDS London. Although he is at pains to keep a wall between these two domains, the book is at its most electrifying when Nick\u2019s fraught compartmentalization comes under pressure.", "Nick is not the only one who strives for a rigid social compartmentalization. The Feddens, while seemingly a tolerant bunch, make it subtly but unmistakably clear that Nick\u2019s being gay is perfectly all right \u2014 so long as it\u2019s never discussed. This prohibition recalls the philosopher Michel Foucault\u2019s suggestion that what society finds so disturbing about homosexuality isn\u2019t the act of gay sex itself but gay relationships, which demonstrate that procreative heterosexual monogamy is not the only way to manage the chaotic energies of erotic life. It is striking how much the Feddens\u2019 attitude toward Nick resembles Updike\u2019s attitude toward Nick\u2019s creator. One is seen as a threat to the institution of heterosexual family life, the other as a threat to the literary form that has traditionally taken heterosexual family life as its principal subject matter. Yet far from threatening the novel, Hollinghurst has rejuvenated it, revealing how many more kinds of experience \u2014 how many previously unrepresented gestures and impressions and longings and relationships \u2014 it was possible to include in a novel than had been dreamed of by literature\u2019s straight gatekeepers.", "After he begins seeing Leo Charles, a working-class man of West Indian descent, Nick receives a visit from his new lover at the Feddens\u2019 opulent Notting Hill townhouse. Gerald answers the door and summons Nick. There follows a moment of flustered intimacy:", "It was the first time in his life he\u2019d had a lover call for him, and the fact had a scandalous dazzle to it. Gerald didn\u2019t ask Leo in, but stood back a little to let Nick pass and to see if there was going to be any kind of trouble.", "\u201cHello, Nick,\u201d said Leo.", "\u201cLeo!\u201d", "Nick shook his hand and kept holding it as he stepped out onto the shallow porch, between the gleaming Tuscan pillars.", "\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d said Leo, giving his cynical little smile, but his eyes almost caressing, passing Nick a secret message, and then nodding him a sign that Gerald had withdrawn; though he must have been able to hear him saying, \u201c ... some pal of Nick\u2019s ... \u201d and a few moments later, \u201cNo, black chappie.\u201d", "The queer theorist Sara Ahmed has enjoined readers to \u201cthink of the kinds of experiences you have when you are not expected to be\u201d in a particular place or environment. \u201cThese experiences are a resource to generate knowledge.\u201d \u201cThe Line of Beauty\u201d \u2014 the entire Hollinghurst oeuvre \u2014 is a horde of estranged, surreptitiously acquired knowledge about English high society, generated by the experience of not belonging to it, of being tolerated without being accepted. Consider the centuries of tortured history that haunt the short, ostensibly rather comic sentence, \u201cGerald didn\u2019t ask Leo in, but stood back a little to let Nick pass and to see if there was going to be any kind of trouble.\u201d Or consider the fathomless ignorance \u2014 always a sure index of privilege \u2014 betrayed by the following exchange from later in the book. The AIDS crisis is at its height, and Nick is doing his best to speak reasonably with a friend of the Fedden family\u2019s, the kind of comic gargoyle at which Hollinghurst excels, who believes that \u201cthe homosexuals\u201d have brought the disease on themselves:", "\u201cBut as we all know,\u201d Nick went on flatteringly, and with a sort of weary zeal now the moment had come, \u201cthere are other things one can do. I mean there\u2019s oral sex, which may be dangerous, but is certainly less so.\u201d", "Sally received this stoically. \u201cKissing, you mean.\u201d", " the more ghastly recent accessions,\u201d Hollinghurst murmured enthusiastically as we paused before Paul Emsley\u2019s painting of a sallow-faced, almost vampiric Kate Middleton (the cause of much public consternation when it was unveiled several years ago) on the second floor of the National Portrait Gallery in London\u2019s West End. Fifteen minutes earlier, in the basement cafe, he had been somewhat subdued, stoically hunched over a cup of coffee. His rumbling drawl, lent even more texture and resonance by a persistent cough, was only faintly audible above the reverberating din of trapped voices. Months of promotional events for \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d had taken their toll, and soon he would head to the United States to do it all again. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite got my pep back,\u201d he conceded apologetically.", "It quickly returned, however, once we climbed the stairs. Surrounded by canvases, Hollinghurst seemed to come to the surface of himself, moving from one source of delight to another in a state of observant rapture. The visual arts have always been central to his work; his novels are themselves galleries, abounding in descriptions of paintings, sculptures, photographs, ornaments, interiors, buildings. I thought of a sentence from \u201cThe Line of Beauty\u201d: \u201cNick stayed on in the church, and the loneliness heightened his pleasure and his pride in his own responsiveness.\u201d Solitude is the natural state of the Hollinghurst protagonists and, also, it would seem, of the man himself. \u201cI love to just put a line through the diary and go into purdah,\u201d he said of his appetite for seclusion while writing \u2014 a capacity he attributes to the experience of growing up an only child. Though there have been exceptions, he has lived alone for much of his life.", "At the same time, Hollinghurst is an avid socializer. \u201cHe moves in an exalted realm,\u201d said the philosopher Galen Strawson, who met Hollinghurst when they worked together at The Times Literary Supplement in the early 1980s. \u201cHe seems to know everybody in a high sphere of English cultural life.\u201d The novelist Edward St. Aubyn, who spoke of Hollinghurst\u2019s \u201caltruistic stamina,\u201d asked Hollinghurst to be his son\u2019s godfather. Susannah Clapp, the theater critic at The Observer, told me that whenever his friends have an \u201cO birthday\u201d (40, 50, 60), he takes them to see an opera of their choice. He has also been known to deliver speeches in rhyming couplets at his friends\u2019 momentous occasions. Naturally, the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s former director, Sandy Nairne, was another old friend of Hollinghurst\u2019s. A decade ago, Nairne asked him to be a selector for an exhibition at the museum called \u201cGay Icons.\u201d", "We turned a corner into a room dominated by another royal portrait \u2014 John Lavery\u2019s immense, obsequious painting of King George V with his wife and children from 1913. \u201cSort of the manner of Sargent,\u201d Hollinghurst commented, \u201cbut nothing like as brilliant.\u201d In the final section of \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair,\u201d which is set in 2012, Johnny, now in late middle age, takes a commission from the nouveau riche Miserden family. Bella, the matriarch, a vain TV personality, wants him to model his painting on Lavery\u2019s. Rankled by the Miserdens\u2019 self-importance, Johnny instead envisions a work of scalding honesty (Bella\u2019s husband, Alan, a dot-com millionaire, \u201cfit and sleek in tight jeans, with no apparent genitals, had the overall smoothness of features that expects good fortune but never attracts much personal devotion\u201d) before finally settling on something, if not exactly flattering, at least more respectful and sedate.", "The episode underscores one of the novel\u2019s central themes \u2014 postwar English decline. A century earlier, Johnny would have been painting the Windsors; now, in a society made by and for such pampered materialists as the Miserdens, he is left with a less-exalted subject. To be clear, Hollinghurst is no Tory; his reverence for the past is scrupulously qualified. As a gay man, he certainly harbors no nostalgia for an earlier time. As a novelist, however, he admits to finding the present a little thin.", "At the NPG, Hollinghurst acknowledged certain paintings as though he were greeting, or purposely avoiding, the regulars at a private members club. \u201cDear old Vaughan Williams,\u201d he said as we passed Gerald Kelly\u2019s portrait of the composer in old age, with his immense jowls and tragicomic hearing aid. \u201cClement Attlee there,\u201d he said, not pausing to look at George Harcourt\u2019s rendering of the prime minister.

Philpot, who lived with a male partner, painted dashing young men with a boldness and fervor that now seem patently gay. In the self-portrait, smartly dressed in a waistcoat and cuff links, he stares out at you with a languid composure that, after a while, in its decorous way, begins to take on a hint of the confrontational.
