"MARIGOLD walls, goldenrod tablecloths, egg yolks spilling into moist corn-colored mamaliga: yellow, yellow, yellow at Acasa in Sunnyside, Queens.,Acasa is a new Romanian place on a stretch of Skillman Avenue thatâ€™s not poor in the Romanian department. The dining room is dominated by a massive photo mural that struck me as being sci-fi: a solar eclipse in a red sky on one end; a rocky, Martian outcropping on the other. Thatâ€™s what too much goulash will get you into, I thought.,Wrong, I was. Marian Golea, the restaurantâ€™s effusive owner, explained that it was a photograph of the Romanian Sphinx, a rocky outcropping on the Bucegi Platform, taken during a total solar eclipse. As soon as Mr. Golea suggested it, the rock looked exactly like the profile of its more recently constructed and more internationally famous Egyptian brother.,Who knew you could argue that the Great Sphinx of Giza was a knockoff? You learn something new every night in this town.,One evening I learned that desserts at Acasa are very, very good, particularly papanasi cu smantana ($4), which the menu translates as â€œFried Cheese Donuts with sweet vanilla creamy sauce.â€ù I offer this nugget of discovery up front because anyone who does not budget his appetite will not have room for this.,For something a little less filling, go for the clatite cu gem ($4), crepes stuffed with jam. A friend of mine with a Romanian grandmother did, and devoured them, evoking her good name and good cooking.,He did the same with an order of red peppers stuffed with meat and rice. Mr. Golea linked the goulash and the mushroom stew with white sauce to Transylvania, the region of Romanian from which he hails. After moving to the United States, he spent 15 years working at different jobs â€” much of the time as a mechanical engineer at Kennedy Airport â€” before opening Acasa, his first restaurant.,While there may be the occasional Transylvanian accent on the menu, itâ€™s not as strong as, say, Bela Lugosiâ€™s. Mr. Golea said the Romanians who visit his restaurant come from all over Romania, so there are dishes to suit everyone.,A supremely creamy caviar spread, much like taramosalata, and other mezes with a Mediterranean accent, like a garlicky, light bean spread and a too-smoky eggplant dip, evince the Greek and Turkish influences on Romaniaâ€™s cooking. Order a few ($4 each), and the kitchen will assemble a platter for the table.,A smoked pork knuckle â€” meager and sinewy but studded with enough meaty nuggets to merit inclusion on the list of house specialties â€” is served over melted cabbage ($11.99). It reflects the century Romania spent as a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.,My favorite dishes at Acasa feature mamaliga, Romaniaâ€™s answer to polenta. Itâ€™s a perfect foil to grilled lamb (erroneously billed as lamb pastrami) or braised pork. I liked it best with a fried egg, a huge dollop of sour cream and a side order of sour-and-sweet pickled red peppers.,Thereâ€™s beer and wine, and the Romanian choices are affordable and acceptable. Ursus is a pilsner that goes back easy. I tried two white wines: the riesling is drier than the muscat.,One night, after ordering a bottle of the riesling ($12), my waitress asked me if Iâ€™d like seltzer, too. She was upselling me, I thought, but I opted for it anyway. Wrong again. The seltzer was for the wine, to make what from here on I will refer to as Transylvanian champagne.,It might have been too much of that Transylvanian champagne, or maybe it was a calorie-overloaded hallucination, but I swear the sphinx whispered to me one night. It told me that eating crispy carnaciori oltenesti ($4) â€” hot dog-like sausages paired with Windy City-style yellow mustard â€” in the shadow of an eclipse would trigger a slaughtering of favored colts by savage bears this coming Sunday. Who am I to argue with the Romanian Sphinx?,48-06 Skillman Avenue (48th Street), Sunnyside, Queens; (718) 651-1364., Caviar spread; meatball appetizer; grilled lamb with mamaliga; mamaliga with egg and sour cream; pickled red peppers., Small dishes, $4 to $6; main courses, $7.99 to $14.99; desserts, $4., Cash only.,Noon to 10 p.m. Monday to Thursday; to midnight Friday, Saturday and Sunday., Accessible.",PETER MEEHAN,"JAN. 31, 2007",Sharing Romanian Under a Sphinx,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/dining/reviews/31unde.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE chef Gordon Ramsay has a British television show called â€œThe F Word,â€ù an American television show called â€œHellâ€™s Kitchenâ€ù and, by all accounts and appearances, the kind of foul mouth and foul temper those titles suggest.,You might expect his debut New York restaurant to be brash and any of its shortcomings to be attributable to audacity, not timidity.,Youâ€™d be wrong.,Step into Gordon Ramsay at the London, so named because it inhabits the London NYC Hotel, which used to be the Rihga Royal. Look hard for any vibrancy, any color. The walls, which resemble mother-of-pearl, are less a hue than a mood: coolly, even icily, elegant.,The flowers on and around the dozen tables are white. Against this monochrome, red letters above the doors â€” the ones spelling exit â€” exert the most potent tug on your attention. Those arenâ€™t promising signs.,The cautious palette foreshadows a cautious menu, as reliant on default luxuries and flourishes like foie gras and black truffles as on real imagination. Most ingredients are predictable, most flavors polite, most effects muted. Mr. Ramsay may be a bad boy beyond the edges of the plate, but in its center, heâ€™s more a goody-two-shoes.,And for all his brimstone and bravado, his strategy for taking Manhattan turns out to be a conventional one, built on familiar French ideas and techniques that have been executed with more flair, more consistency and better judgment in restaurants with less vaunted pedigrees.,An appetizer of caramelized sweetbreads with creamed artichoke had a textbook luxuriousness, but it didnâ€™t venture into any new or particularly gripping chapters. An entree of roasted chicken for two was adorned with a sufficiently flavorful fricassee of bacon, onions and prunes, but it was still just a roasted chicken for two.,Mr. Ramsay is probably Englandâ€™s most famous chef, draped in Michelin stars. His arrival in Manhattan reflects his continuing global expansion â€” heâ€™s also in Tokyo, also in Dubai â€” while looking forward to the seemingly inevitable day when your top-tier restaurant choices in a major destination on one continent are much the same as those in a major destination on another.,Ramsay? Ducasse? Vongerichten? Perhaps you just go with the restaurant of your countryman, supporting the home team. Thatâ€™s the route suggested by the makeup of the dining room at the new Ramsay, where British visitors were abundant. Itâ€™s comforting to know that Americans arenâ€™t the only tourists who travel far from home and then stay and sup in reminders of it.,There are actually two conjoined restaurants under Mr. Ramsayâ€™s supervision and banner in the hotel; the other one, through which visitors to the inner sanctum walk, is called the London Bar. Itâ€™s bigger and more casual, with a shiny retro look that makes you feel as if youâ€™re inside a gargantuan vintage car.,The London Barâ€™s menu of small plates â€” three to six make a meal â€” yielded an equal number of hits (a layered parfait evoking the components of a B.L.T. sandwich) and misses (a layered parfait of warm avocado, ice-cold crab and sweet corn sorbet).,The barroom has a more adventurous spirit than the formal dining room, which makes you feel as if youâ€™re in a space capsule floating through a supra-national limbo. The accents of the servers are English, French and German (or was it Dutch?), as if the entire European Union was tapped for the right cast of characters to stride across the restaurantâ€™s carpeted floor.,And they stride with grace and good sense, finding the right note of solicitousness, not intrusiveness. Their deftly calibrated pitch reflects the restaurantâ€™s success in presenting most of the coddling staples of traditional haute dining â€” the service carts, the tableside anointments â€” without the full degree of pomp.,Without too  crippling a cost, either. The $80 that Gordon Ramsay charges for a three-course prix fixe  is entirely reasonable in this cityâ€™s current dining climate, considering everything the restaurant provides: croutons with foie gras and truffled cream cheese spreads at the start of a meal; a flurry of first-rate petit fours at the end; genuinely helpful guidance through the restaurantâ€™s comprehensive lists of wines and other spirits.,But the restaurant fails to deliver the most important thing of all: excitement. And itâ€™s impossible, given Mr. Ramsayâ€™s reputation, not to be primed for it, and not to be rankled by the low-key loveliness that you get in its place.,The cauliflower beignets in an appetizer of caramelized sea scallops were adorable, but they were playing cameos in a dish whose stars turned in dutiful, forgettable performances. Among roughly eight appetizer selections on the prix fixe menu most nights, the only bold standout was red mullet, served as pan-fried fillets that were framed and tamed perfectly by the brightness, acidity and sweetness of a pink grapefruit vinaigrette.,Among a similar number of entrees, there was a similar dearth of inspiration. While chorizo and artichoke lent plenty of personality to a beautifully roasted fillet of black bass, a bitter chocolate sauce and a beet fondant didnâ€™t jazz up slices of venison loin quite as much as they needed to. The dishâ€™s music remained faint.,And there were a few off-putting concoctions, like a cloying, gummy wedge of turbot poached in St. Ã‰milion and a bizarre appetizer combining delicate little langoustine tails with indelicate nuggets of boneless chicken wing, crusted with hazelnuts and sweetened with maple syrup. Eric Ripert, meet Colonel Sanders.,The best desserts by the pastry chef, Alistair Wise, were terrific: a tarte Tatin with crisp pastry, and a flawless apricot soufflÃ© with sugary almonds and almond ice cream.,Mr. Wise and the chef de cuisine, Neil Ferguson, are running a serious kitchen here and capable of impeccable work.  And that makes the restaurantâ€™s tentativeness and its bad decisions, which were too numerous, all the more frustrating.,Why did envelopes of raw, thinly sliced, unpleasantly papery red beet, which were stuffed with ricotta and sprinkled with pine nuts, appear so often? They showed up as a trio in a dish on the London Bar menu, as a duo in a course on an extended  dining-room tasting menu and as individual amuse-bouches for the dining roomâ€™s  prix fixe. Seldom have such frail shoulders been asked to carry such a heavy load.,And seldom has a conquistador as bellicose as Mr. Ramsay landed with such a whisper. Itâ€™s not an unappealing sound, but itâ€™s nothing thatâ€™s going to prick up your ears.,The London NYC Hotel, 151 West 54th Street; (212) 468-8888 or ,.,A shiny, almost colorless room of just a dozen tables that seem to exist in a luxury space capsule floating through a limbo without any distinct geographic tether., Quiet., Pan-fried red mullet; caramelized sweetbreads; black bass with chorizo; halibut with smoked salmon; apricot soufflÃ©; tarte Tatin. In the London Bar, tuna and swordfish carpaccio; â€œB.L.T.â€ù; roasted sablefish with creamed parsnip; beef â€œtongue â€™nâ€™ cheek.â€ù, Wide-ranging, well-chosen and commendably varied in price, with many bottles under $70 and an appealing array of wines by the glass., Three-course prix fixe, $80. Six-course tasting menu, $110. In the London Bar, tapas-style dishes from $12 to $18, with a four-course prix fixe for $55 and six courses for $75., Lunch from noon to 2:30 p.m. and dinner from 5:30 to 11 p.m. daily. The London Bar is open from 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., with a breakfast menu in effect until 11 a.m., For prime dinner times, call at least one month and as many as two months in advance., All major cards.,Hotel lobby, London Bar and restaurant itself all on street level, with accessible restrooms., Ratings range form zero to four stars and reflect the reviewerâ€™s reaction to food, ambience and service, with price taken into consideration.

"AN icy wind blasted in our faces as we trudged up a rocky slope on the southern outskirts of Kabul, the war-shattered capital of ,. Around us rose a moonscape of treeless, dun-colored hills, broken by clusters of mud-walled squatter huts. I squinted into the sunlight, looking east toward the earthen citadel of Bala Hissar, a stronghold from the time of the Silk Road to the post-Soviet wars. High above us, another wall of mud brick and stone â€” a fragment of the ancient rampart of Kabul, constructed before the arrival of Islam in a futile attempt to defend the city against invaders from Arabia and Central Asia â€” snaked along the ridgeline.,â€œItâ€™s always been easy to conquer Afghanistan,â€ù said my companion, Jonathan Bean, the American co-founder of the Great Game Travel Company Afghanistan, which shepherded about 70 Western tourists, including several dozen Americans, through this rugged land last year. â€œThe problem is keeping control of it.â€ù,After an hourâ€™s slog up trackless scree to the top of the ridge, Jonathan and I, along with our security guard, a lean, gray-bearded Pashtun named Shafik Ullah, reached the rampart. We followed it for a mile, sometimes walking alongside it, sometimes balancing ourselves on its crumbling surface. Perforated with apertures for archers, 30 feet high in places, the barrier climbed toward the summit of Kabulâ€™s highest hill, 7,200 feet above sea level.,The Hindu Kush, a massif of snow and ice, loomed 30 miles to the north; Kabul lay far below us, obscured behind a layer of dust and smoke that smudged the panorama like a dirty fingerprint. Jonathan opened a thermos of coffee, and we warmed ourselves amid piles of stones and spent cartridges, the remains of a military post used by Ahmad Shah Massoud and his Northern Alliance fighters during the battle for Kabul in the early 1990s. â€œYou can feel the history all around us,â€ù Shafik said.,In the 1970s, tens of thousands of visitors poured into Kabul each year, when the Afghan capital rivaled Kathmandu as the favored Central Asian haunt for young backpackers who bunked down in cheap hotels and congregated on fabled Chicken Street to smoke hashish and while away the hours in coffee and carpet shops.,Then came the Russians, then the Taliban, and then the bombings following 9/11, pretty much destroying Kabulâ€™s reputation as a favored stop on the Hippie Trail. Now, however, even though much of Afghanistan remains dangerous, tourists are beginning to trickle back in, some lured by the thrill of the unknown, others by the pleasures offered by such new tourist spots as the Kabul Serena, an elegant $36.5-million  hotel that claims a â€œfive-star ambienceâ€ù in the heart of the city. As many as 5,000 Western tourists visited Kabul last year, Jonathan Bean told me, most of them affluent Europeans and Americans who have traveled to â€œ30 or 40â€ù countries, including developing ones. â€œMost our clients are experienced travelers,â€ù Jonathan said. â€œTheyâ€™ve trekked in Nepal, gone on safari in East Africa. Some have returned after coming here in the 1960s and 1970s. They see Afghanistan as the next great adventure-travel destination.â€ù,Most tourists who pass through view Kabul as an overnight stopover on the way to more remote corners of the country: the rugged Pamir Mountains in the northeast; the exotic bazaar town of Mazar-i-Sharif; and Bamiyan, the former site of the giant stone Buddhas that were destroyed by the Taliban. But those who linger for a few days, as I did, will discover a vibrant capital, steeped in tumultuous history and rich with Silk Road atmospherics.,â€œKabul is the definition of the frontier town,â€ù I was told by Rory Stewart, the British diplomat turned author of the â€œThe Places in Between,â€ù a best-selling account of his winter walk from Herat to Kabul just after the Talibanâ€™s defeat. Today Mr. Stewart lives in Kabul, where he runs the Turquoise Mountain Foundation, which trains local craftsmen and is helping to renovate the decrepit Old Town by the Kabul River. The city is â€œa pluralistic place, with a fascinating history, half a dozen languages and countless subcultures,â€ù he said.,The cityâ€™s security remains a cause for concern. Although most of the violence is concentrated in Taliban strongholds in the countryâ€™s southeast, a handful of attacks have rocked the capital during the last year, including a suicide-bomb explosion on Sept. 8 at Massoud Circle, a major traffic hub, that killed 2 Americans and at least 16 Afghans. Anti-Western riots broke out last May in the aftermath of a fatal collision involving an American military convoy and civilian vehicles; crowds chanted â€œdeath to Americaâ€ù and attacked restaurants, hotels, police stations and shops, and British marines evacuated 21 European diplomats from the city.,MOST foreign aid workers and diplomats live inside walled compounds guarded round the clock by private security teams, and the United Nations restricts its employees to hotels and restaurants in the capital that meet its stringent security regulations, including high blast walls and buildings set back several dozen yards from the road. Those who live in the city said the United Nations also put out daily threat warnings: â€œGreen City,â€ù meaning one could travel around the city freely; â€œWhite City,â€ù no unnecessary travel; and â€œRed City,â€ù advising foreigners to stay indoors.,Yet with a few spectacular exceptions, the capital has remained violence free. â€œNATO and Afghan security forces have done a good job,â€ù I was told by Vince White, a Ministry of Finance consultant who has lived in Kabul for nearly five years. â€œThe security companies try to make us paranoid,â€ù he said. â€œThey depend on expatriate fear for their business.â€ù,Jonathan Bean regularly takes foreign tourists on walking tours of Kabul with a single, unarmed Afghan security guard. â€œPeople love Kabul,â€ù Johnathan said. â€œTheyâ€™ve heard nothing positive about the place â€” that it was destroyed, that itâ€™s dangerous. Then they get here and get a big surprise â€” they see a bustling bazaar city, full of life.â€ù,In a week of exploring the city, from the windswept, near-deserted ramparts to the teeming, labyrinthine passageways of the Mandayi Bazaar, I never once felt threatened. To the contrary, I was welcomed everywhere by Afghans eager to show me that their country and city were groping their way toward recovery.,My arrival at Kabulâ€™s airport from New Delhi, on a dreary November afternoon, however, offered a hint of the still-shaky state of affairs in Afghanistan. The electricity in the terminal had been cut, and, in the semi-darkness, laborers dumped piles of baggage on the floor beside the immobile conveyor belt, setting off a scramble among my fellow passengers. An elderly Pashtun in a shalwar kamiz (a traditional shirt often seen also in Pakistan and India) and a gray turban elbowed me aside and lunged for an overstuffed cardboard box. Two airport policemen stood by idly, watching the chaos. Bags in hand, I stumbled through the frantic crowd, hailed a battered taxi, and headed for the Gandamack Lodge, a renovated 1930s villa owned by Peter Jouvenal, an old Afghan hand and former BBC cameraman. (The Gandamak, which opened in 2002, originally occupied a house that had belonged to one of Osama Bin Ladenâ€™s wives; Mr. Jouvenal moved it into its current  building last year.),It didnâ€™t take me long to discover one of the newest hubs of expatriate Kabul. A photojournalist friend directed me to the Cabul Coffee House, a cozy establishment, painted adobe-pink and filled with Central Asian handicrafts, located on a muddy alley in the lively Qal-I-Fatula district.,Opened last year by two American women and the Afghan husband of one of them, the Cabul Coffee House functions as a sort of cross between Starbucks and a Manhattan literary bar. In addition to its lattes and double-shot cappuccinos, it offers readings and lectures one or two nights a week. I got there at about six oâ€™clock on a Tuesday evening to find several dozen  Westerners, including aid workers, teachers, contractors and consultants, along with a smattering of Afghans, eating cheeseburgers, Greek salads and kebabs while waiting for the cultural program to begin. (The fact that so many foreigners had ventured into the streets of Kabul after dark was perhaps the most telling indication of the capitalâ€™s relative stability.),The guest speaker was Whitney Azoy, a Princeton-educated former United States diplomat to Afghanistan. Mr. Azoy had left the foreign service decades ago and transformed himself into one of the worldâ€™s experts on buzkashi, Afghanistanâ€™s national sport, a sort of polo played with a goat carcass.,When I arrived, I found Mr. Azoy huddled in a corner of the cafe with the American screenwriter of â€œPretty Womanâ€ù, J. F. Lawton, who had been in the country for weeks researching a documentary about buzkashi. Then Mr. Azoy stood before the crowd and delivered an hourlong talk, accompanied by slides, about his discovery of this rough, fast-paced sport in the mountains of northern Afghanistan during his diplomatic tour in the 1970s. There was an unspoken poignancy to his lecture and his slides, all of which had been taken during that era: the world he was describing in loving detail was soon to by obliterated by the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war. (Although buzkashi is not indigenous to Kabul, President Muhammad Daoud brought it to the capital in 1978; matches have returned to Kabul, on a sporadic basis, since the Talibanâ€™s fall.),The following day I hired a driver at the Gandamack and set out to see the National Museum of Afghanistan, in western Kabul. Large sections of capital remained wrecked after decades of war and neglect; beggars swarmed over us at intersections, and the traffic in the downtown area, along the Kabul River, was horrendous. In the heavy rain, the myriad unpaved streets had turned into quagmires. (During dry periods, I would soon discover, an opaque layer of dust and car exhaust hangs over the city bowl.) As we drove west along the Darulaman Road, past the former Soviet Embassy â€” an area of heavy fighting in 1993 and 1994 between Massoud and rival warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar â€” I looked over empty tracts and the hulks of shelled, bullet-pocked buildings. The devastation was ubiquitous.,The National Museum itself bears testimony to the traumas of the last two decades. Until 1992 it contained one of the finest collections of art and cultural artifacts in Asia: 100,000 pieces from two millenniums of Afghan history. During the fight for Kabul, mujahedeen armies occupied and looted the museum; the structure was shelled in 1993 and fire destroyed the roof and the second floor. By the time the Taliban seized power, only a few thousand pieces remained; the museumâ€™s staff had hidden away the best works. Then, in 2001, Taliban leaders ordered all art objects depicting the human form destroyed, and cadres set upon the remaining exhibits with axes and sledgehammers, ruining 2,500 more works.,But the museum, like much of Kabul, is struggling back to life. The two-story, gray concrete villa was rebuilt with Greek, American and Italian money in 2004. When I arrived, workmen were laying tiles in the lobby and putting the finishing touches on a travertine staircase, a project being financed by an aid group from The Netherlands. Though most galleries were locked and display cases empty, I pushed through a half-open door and came upon a magnificent collection of 18th- and 19th-century wood-carved deities and monarchs from Nuristan, a mountainous province northeast of Jalalabad. These surreal treasures, reminiscent of West African fertility gods and Picassoâ€™s cubist works, were recently patched back together after being hammered into fragments by Taliban zealots. After admiring the several dozen works â€” hatchet marks and gouges still visible in the wood â€” I met with Omara Khan Massoudi, the museumâ€™s general director.,Mr. Massoudi was preparing the museumâ€™s second exhibition since the Talibanâ€™s fall, set to open in the winter of 2007: photographs and artifacts salvaged from the covered bazaar in Tashqurghan, a unique, mud-walled complex of mosques, shops and homes, bombed into rubble by the Soviets in 1982. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam donated glass cases for the exhibition, and those cases will later be used to house the permanent collection. â€œI hope within two years we can restore the museum to something like it was,â€ù Mr. Massoudi told me. â€œIt all depends on security.â€ù,Many of Kabulâ€™s most impressive structures are off limits to tourists. The citadel of Bala Hissar â€” occupied over the centuries by the Mongols, the Moguls and the British â€” is now a military installation. The surrounding grounds were mined during the Soviet occupation and have yet to be cleared. The domed hilltop mausoleum of Nadir Shah, father of the aged present-day monarch, Zahir Shah, remains closed while its vandalized marble facade is painstakingly restored.,I did gain entry to the Babur Gardens, a rehabilitated complex of rose gardens and poplars beloved of the Mogul emperor who won Kabul from a rival in the 16th century and made Kabul his capital. Among its treasures is a small marble tomb, built by another Mogul emperor, Shah Jahan, who later built the Taj Mahal. I also visited  the OMAR Mine Museum, which displays hundreds of Soviet-era personnel and anti-tank mines, along with an arsenalâ€™s worth of mortar shells, bullets and cluster bombs, a testament to the brutality of the Soviet occupation.,The real fascination of Kabul, I found, lies in the ordinary rhythms of life here, in the bustle of a reviving city. Early one morning Jonathan  and Shafik met me in the lobby of the Serena (perhaps the only luxury  hotel in the world that operates on a cash-only basis), to which I had moved  after a few nights at the Gandamack, and led me on foot along the Kabul River to the Mandayi Market.,Destroyed by British forces in the 1840s, and again during the 1990s civil war, this rebuilt bazaar is the nerve center of the Afghan capital. Shafts of sunlight penetrated serpentine alleys lined by canvas-covered wooden stalls; the harsh light illuminated the bearded faces of Pashtun merchants and their bountiful wares: nuts, spices, dried fruits, tea, slabs of raw meat, live turkeys, blankets, beads of lapis lazuli. Sparks flew from the spinning wheels of knife sharpeners, and strips of beef sizzled in huge pans of sesame oil. Adolescent boys careened through the passages pushing wheelbarrows, sending shoppers scurrying for safety; two butchers led a bleating black sheep to a rear courtyard for slaughter.,We turned into a cacophonous bird market, where bright-green parakeets and budgies flitted by the hundreds inside bamboo cages. Five ethnic Uzbek men, swathed in wool blankets, with dark faces and almond eyes suggesting their Mongol ancestry, marched single-file through the alley and struck a deal for a fighting partridge, a large, red-beaked bird whose killer instinct is legendary. â€œThe High Court has ruled bird fighting illegal,â€ù Shafik told me, â€œBut it happens every Friday morning across the city. Itâ€™s a part of life in Kabul.â€ù,THAT evening, Vince White, the American consultant, took me to a teetering building in the shadow of the domed Pul-i-Khishti Mosque, the dominant edifice of central Kabul. We had come to attend a weekly gathering of Sufi Muslims, members of a mystical sect  whose ritualistic music, qawwali, and dance were banned during the Taliban era but have since been revived. We slipped past hashish-smoking men in a muddy alley, climbed to the buildingâ€™s second floor, removed our shoes and entered a fluorescent-lit room.,Seated on the green-carpeted floor were burly ethnic Tajiks wearing the beretlike brown pakul, popularized by Massoud; Pashtuns with prophetsâ€™ white beards and billowing turbans; sloe-eyed Uzbeks and Hazaras; and a Medusa-haired ascetic in rags who flopped down beside me and began haranguing me in Dari, Afghanistanâ€™s dominant language (close to Farsi). All other eyes were focused on an elderly sitarist in a white turban, an adolescent drummer, a harmonium player, a virtuouso of the rubab â€” a mandolinlike Afghan instrument â€” and a black-haired young vocalist who is regarded, Mr. White told me, as one of Afghanistanâ€™s finest Sufi singers. â€œAll of these people are poor,â€ù he said, over the singerâ€™s wailing vibrato. â€œThis is a great escape from the problems of life in Afghanistan.â€ù,I stared across the room at a black-bearded gnome shrouded in a white robe. His head was bobbing, his face frozen in a rictus of ecstasy. The wild-haired ascetic clapped his hands to his cheeks and began to sway back and forth. A young Pashtun poured me a cup of Afghan green tea, and I sipped contentedly as the music wafted over me. Then, near midnight, my companion and I headed back to our car, through a darkened alley, past the sweet aroma of hashish, and the huddled forms of men warming themselves around a wood fire glowing in a barrel. Kabul â€” raw, ruined, yet stirring back to life â€” had never seemed more magical.,There are no direct flights between the United States and Kabul, ,. Flights between J. F. K. and Dubai begin at about $700. From Dubai, you can connect to Kam Air (,; 888-952-6247), a private Afghan airline with daily flights between Dubai and Kabul. A Dubai-Kabul round trip costs about $430.,The U.S. dollar is almost universally accepted in Afghanistan.,The best hotel in town by far is the ,(Froshgah Street; 93-79-9654-000; ,), in the heart of the congested downtown area, near the Kabul River and the Mandayi Market. Opened in November 2005, the $36.5 million showpiece, with 160 rooms and 17 suites, was reconstructed out of the carcass of the old Kabul Hotel near Zamegar Park. Double rooms are about $140 a night: all have high-speed Internet connections, with Wi-Fi in the lobby. Public spaces are crammed with Afghan carpets, along with antique furniture, copperware and local art.,The , (Charahi Ansari, Shar e Naw; 93-20-220-3131) is a somewhat downscale alternative to the Serena in Kabulâ€™s restaurant and entertainment district. It has 90 rooms, 40 apartments and Wi-Fi. Double rooms are  $100 a night.,Peter Jouvenalâ€™s ,(93-70-27-6937 or 93-79-56-9904; ,), on Sherpur Square, is a dark, atmospheric hangout for foreign correspondents and aid workers, as well as the occasional adventure traveler. It has 15 pleasant rooms, which cost $115 a night, a good restaurant, a basement bar called the Hare and Hound and frequent cultural events, including lectures and movie screenings.

"Joel Sachs does nothing by half measures, it seems. Last year Mr. Sachs, the director of the ,â€™s annual Focus! festival and a mainstay of New Yorkâ€™s new-music scene, felt it was time to present a series devoted to contemporary Hungarian music. Soliciting the advice of colleagues was not enough, nor was traveling to Budapest: Mr. Sachs, according to his program note, spent July learning Hungarian.,A daunting prospect, but it speaks to the immersive approach that has long informed his Focus! events. This yearâ€™s series, which got under way on Friday with a performance by the New Juilliard Ensemble, was planned as a tribute to Gyorgy Ligeti, the senior figure of the Hungarian avant-garde. When Ligeti died in June, the festival became a memorial. It also celebrates the birthday of another prominent composer, Gyorgy Kurtag, who turns 81 in February.,In a chamber music concert held on Monday night in the Juilliard Schoolâ€™s Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Ligeti was represented by three of his Ã©tudes for solo piano. These dazzling pieces have become staples in the repertory of many an adventurous pianist lately, both for their technical challenges and their refined effect.,In No. 3, â€œTouches BloquÃ©es,â€ù the pianistâ€™s flying right hand is blocked by an obdurate left. No. 5, â€œArc en Ciel,â€ù is gently impulsive, filled with elegant daubs of jazzy harmony. No. 6, â€œAutomne Ã  Varsovie,â€ù is filled with daunting polyrhythms meant to be dispatched at breakneck speed. The pianist Chaun Qin handled these selections ably, growing more confident with each.,Mr. Kurtagâ€™s â€œOfficium Breve in Memoriam Andreae Szervanszky,â€ù  for string quartet, was canceled because of a performerâ€™s illness; in its place Mr. Sachs programmed â€œLocomotive Symphonyâ€ù (1998), an electronic work by Laszlo Sary. The piece was ingeniously constructed from the sounds of locomotives. Steam whistles tooted a merry melody like a wheezy calliope; track rhythms were fashioned into a percussive tattoo that might have been a Steve Reich phase piece for two marching bands.,In Marcell Dargayâ€™s â€œAlbumblatt  â€”  Varosligeti Fasor 33,â€ù Gyu Young Huh, a flutist, blew airy multiphonic chords over lines played by the pianist Matthew Odell, whose instrument had been partially modified to timbre-distorting effect. Despite its unusual sounds and oblique tonality, the brief piece conformed to the contours of a melancholy ballad.,â€œTundragobelin,â€ù by Gyula Csapo, evoked with a series of pithy miniatures the terrain of northern Canada as seen from a low-flying aircraft; the clarinetist Sean Rice, the violinist Eric Siu, the cellist Kaiwen Liu and the pianist Michael Brown offered a polished, committed account.,Jeremiah Bills, a flutist, and Elizabeth Lara, a cellist, interacted with chiming electronics in Gyula Bankoviâ€™s bittersweet â€œSilver-Winged Butterflies.â€ù,The eveningâ€™s most commanding performance came in Jozsef Sariâ€™s â€œPrae- Inter- and Postludium,â€ù  whose  intricate rhythmic demands  were once beyond human capability, according to the program.

"â€œThe Naked Trucker & T-Bones Show,â€ù which has been appearing on Comedy Central for the last few weeks, is a kind of road and variety show, a cousin, in spirit, to the Blue Collar Comedians. But itâ€™s a dopier, unwelcome cousin â€” more wayward and unhinged â€” with far less investment in the virtue of common sense.,The show, which jumps back and forth from a stage in front of a live studio audience to filmed clips of its two characters driving around in a truck, revolves around the Naked Trucker, portrayed by  Dave (Gruber) Allen, and T-Bones, an idiot drifter played by David Koechner, formerly of â€œSaturday Night Live,â€ù whose sideburns curve around his jaw and look like inverted pistols.,That the 50-ish-looking character with long hair and no clothes on â€” the Naked Trucker wears only shoes and a guitar slung over his shoulder to conceal his midsection â€” is the straight man, the voice of reason, tells you all you need to know about just how strained the efforts at comedy are going to become. Why is the Naked Trucker naked? It is impossible to know. Nakedness doesnâ€™t make him funnier. He is simply not funny. Presumably, someone at Comedy Central noticed the guy who plays a guitar in Times Square wearing only his briefs and cowboy boots and hat and determined that the future was a weekly television appearance by a bare-chested middle-aged man who looks like backup for Lynyrd Skynyrd.,The appeal of the so-called Blue Collar Comedians â€” , and the rest â€” is that they ground their humor in the trials of averageness. But Mr. Allen and Mr. Koechner donâ€™t seem to think of themselves as average. They appear to think of themselves as brilliant eccentrics playing the part of simpletons, geniuses whose nonsensical digressions are really not nonsensical at all.,Here is a sampling of some of the banter from T-Bones: â€œHey Trucker, you know when youâ€™re going through a car wash and a couple of guys pull you out of the car, steal the change from your ashtray, put it in a tube sock and beat you with it?â€ù,Nothing in â€œThe Naked Trucker & T-Bones Showâ€ù glides off the tongue.

"Sally Mann came to the worldâ€™s attention in the early 1990s with her book and exhibition â€œImmediate Family,â€ù a series of luminous, haunting photographs of her young children, Emmett, Virginia and Jessie, that evoked the languid anxiety of preadolescence, the sense of somnolent August days soon to vanish with the coming winds of maturity, sex and longing.,Ms. Mannâ€™s pictures arrived as the maelstrom surrounding the McMartin preschool sex-abuse trials in California was finally waning and the hysteria around the sexualizing of children perhaps seemed to be ebbing. But her portraits stirred controversy while they brought her fame, renewing concerns that Americaâ€™s young were no longer adequately and safely kept.,Ms. Mannâ€™s approach to her subject certainly had precedents in art. In the 1920s the photographers Imogen Cunningham and Nell Dorr took nude pictures of children in the wilds as expressions of their own interest in naturalism. But Ms. Mannâ€™s images arrived just as the country was beginning to fall deeper and deeper under the thrall of a new culture of obsessive child-rearing, and she seemed, however voyeuristically, merely to be letting her children be.,But she was not letting them be, or so it is implied in â€œWhat Remains: The Life and Work of Sally Mannâ€ù on Cinemax this evening. It is one of the most exquisitely intimate portraits not only of an artistâ€™s process, but also of a marriage and a life, to appear on television in recent memory.,Steven Cantor, the director, had made a short documentary about Ms. Mann at the time of â€œImmediate Family.â€ù It was nominated for an Academy Award. He returned to his subject some years later to follow her through her subsequent project, â€œWhat Remainsâ€ù (from which the filmâ€™s title is borrowed), Ms. Mannâ€™s study of death and the human bodyâ€™s decomposition, which made its debut at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington three years ago.,It is not the filmâ€™s central interest to investigate the origins of â€œImmediate Family,â€ù but it manages to reveal the contradictions in the photographerâ€™s relationship to it. Ms. Mann never offered the works as reportage, but her manipulation of the images in some instances took a very deliberate form. Mr. Cantor has had the benefit of spending years filming Ms. Mann, and he had also been given some of her home movies.,In one of them, she is shown directing her son while she is taking a picture of him by a river. Later, she reflects on photographing her daughter Jessie: â€œIâ€™d say, â€˜Jessie, I want you to prop your hand with the candy cigarette with just that look of world-weary ennui on your face,â€™ and she could do it easy. I didnâ€™t even have to mimic it for her.â€ù But Ms. Mann never quite seems to see how significantly her own vision comes into her work. She calls the pictures in â€œImmediate Familyâ€ù â€œtheirâ€ù work, meaning her childrenâ€™s, and she decided to photograph them, she says, because they had â€œextremely potent personalities.â€ù,The beauty of the images remains no less overwhelming for anything the photographer says, but the pictures become provocative in an entirely different way â€” darkly true to what many currently understand parenthood to be, the irrepressible desire to manage and micromanage every transition a child faces. Ms. Mann is not merely watching, she is there in every frame.,Blindsided, she claims in the film, by the panicked reaction to those early pictures, Ms. Mann turned her eye to landscape photography in the mid-1990s. Then in 2000, an incident on her family farm in Lexington, Va., redirected her attentions again. A convict, escaped from a nearby prison, killed himself on her property.,If the pictures of her children had shown Ms. Mann to be a sort of poet of the human body, she now wanted to document the body at the end of its life cycle.

"Thereâ€™s something unfairly disarming about an all-French vocal recital. Both the language and the way French composers have woven music around it are so inherently seductive that, given a singer who has internalized both, resistance â€” or even detatchment â€” is futile. This repertory has always been high ground for the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, and for her recital at , on Monday evening she and her pianist, Malcolm Martineau, explored it in an unusual way.,Instead of the standard model â€” four or five composers, a dozen songs each â€” Ms. Graham and Mr. Martineau assembled a historical tour of the 19th and 20th centuries, with the intermission dividing them. Twenty-two composers were represented, each by a single song, except for Debussy and FaurÃ©, who had a song on each half, and Reynaldo Hahn, who had a well-merited return among the encores.,It seemed, at first, an idea that might work better on paper than on the stage. Several among the first group of 19th-century songs â€” Bizetâ€™s â€œChanson dâ€™Avril,â€ù and  Franckâ€™s Nocturne, for example â€” though amply charming, lacked the allure of later French music. But within a handful of works, that qualm evaporated. Allure may still have been in French musicâ€™s future, but these songs have other attractions.,Laloâ€™s lively â€œGuitare,â€ù among them, has an almost jazzy piano part that a singer must wiggle into. Saint-SaÃ«nsâ€™s â€œDanse macabreâ€ù is the kind of vividly picturesque, dramatic piece that suits Ms. Graham, not least because its imagery invites her to draw on her considerable (and flexible) coloristic range. In Chabrierâ€™s â€œCigales,â€ù similarly, she conveyed a surprising range of emotion (ending with a growl of frustration) in a brief comic song about cicadas.,Others â€” Ã‰mile Paladilheâ€™s pained â€œPsychÃ©â€ù and Duparcâ€™s wrenching â€œAu pays oÃ_ se fait la guerreâ€ù   (â€œTo the War-Torn Landâ€ù) â€” let her demonstrate a more constricted but deeper emotional palette.,The program depended to a great degree on Ms. Grahamâ€™s persuasiveness as both a comic and dramatic singer. Often the juxtapositions were stark: in the first 20th-century group, her wry account of AndrÃ© Capletâ€™s â€œCorbeau et le renardâ€ù (â€œThe Crow and the Foxâ€ù) was followed immediately by the dark intensity of Rousselâ€™s â€œRÃ©ponse dâ€™une Ã©pouse sageâ€ù (â€œResponse of a Virtuous Wifeâ€ù) and Messiaenâ€™s haunting â€œFiancÃ©e perdueâ€ù (â€œLost FiancÃ©eâ€ù).,Ms. Graham made these odd sequences work by carefully shading every phrase, sometimes every word. At times, she didnâ€™t need words at all: her lovely account of FaurÃ©â€™s Vocalise-Ã©tude was one of the programâ€™s highlights.,The encores were better still. After a magnificently velvet-toned performance of   â€œÃ€ Chlorisâ€ù by Reynaldo Hahn, Ms. Graham stepped outside the theme, sort of, to sing a NoÃ«l Coward song, â€œThereâ€™s Always Something Fishy About the French.â€ù",ALLAN KOZINN,"JAN. 31, 2007",Taking a Two-Century Voyage Through the Music of France,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/arts/31grah.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hartford,THE new exhibition at the Conrad L. Mallett Art Gallery at Capitol Community College differs from other exhibitions in at least one respect: touching  the art is allowed, even encouraged.,â€œWeâ€™re thinking of having the guards here say: â€˜Yes! You can touch,â€™ â€ù said Pedro Valentin, the collegeâ€™s art instructor and the exhibitionâ€™s curator.,But there is another difference: this exhibition showcases the work of several , artists who are blind. In particular, it displays the art of David Waite of Mansfield, who lost his sight over eight days in 1997 from a combination of diabetes and Gravesâ€™ disease.,Mr. Waite, who had been a pen-and-ink artist, was working as a courtroom sketch artist for WFSB-TV, Channel 3, in Hartford  at the time. He had to give up his job and initially did not know what to do with himself, until one day a friend suggested that he try working with clay. With that, Mr. Waite became a sculptor.,â€œIf a picture is worth a thousand words, these works have to be worth a thousand feelings,â€ù Mr. Waite said recently, as he stood among several of his sculptures at the exhibition. â€œI use no tools. I use my fingers, and it flows.â€ù,His work, and the work of other Connecticut artists who are blind or whose sight is impaired, will be on display through Jan. 31. The exhibition is easy to see through the front windows of the college, which moved four years ago to  a building  on Main Street  that once housed G. Fox & Company, at one time Hartfordâ€™s largest department store. The buildingâ€™s transformation  into a school included the restoration of  its large storefront windows. What passers-by see are Mr. Waiteâ€™s anatomically realistic depictions of a chief of an  American Indian tribe, an escaped slave, the biblical Moses, a mother grieving for a child lost to war, and the infant Jesus and the Virgin Mary.,â€œYou really work by faith rather than by sight,â€ù Mr. Valentin said to Mr. Waite.,Also clearly visible inside and out are drawings and mixed-media works from students throughout the state. These include a plate that has been  made into the likeness of a human face, and an ethereal pencil drawing of angels, both created by Pamela Cintron Mejias, an 8-year-old fourth grader at the Samuel Huntington School in Norwich; pottery shaped by Ayesha Ali, a 12-year-old seventh-grader  at Newtown Middle School in Newtown; and a mixed-media work by Ashley Dixon, 19, a student at ACES Whitney High School East in Hamden.,â€œWe are always trying to promote Connecticut artists here, especially those least represented,â€ù said Mr. Valentin, who is also a painter and illustrator.",JANE GORDON,"JAN. 21, 2007",Works to Touch by Artists Who Canâ€™t See,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/21ctblind.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"New York Cityâ€™s public hospitals and clinics would lose billions of dollars over the next few years under changes President Bush proposes to make to Medicaid â€” far more than his plan would cost other parts of the country, according to local and state officials.,Under Medicaid, the health plan for the poor, public hospitals can sometimes collect higher payments than private hospitals do for comparable services. Last week, the Bush administration proposed a regulation that would largely do away with that advantage.,The , Department of Health and New York Cityâ€™s Health and Hospitals Corporation, the agency that runs the cityâ€™s public hospital system, estimate that the new rule would cost the corporation $350 million a year, or 7 percent of its annual budget. The cut, officials said, would be felt most in outpatient services, where the system handles five million visits each year.,â€œWe would have to do a wholesale dismantling of our ambulatory care system and scale down our emergency departments,â€ù said Alan D. Aviles, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.,Both that rule change and a separate proposal put forward by the president to cover more uninsured people by diverting Medicaid funds have met with serious opposition in Congress. But the administration may be able to make the rule change without Congressional approval.,Last night, in his State of the Union address, President Bush outlined his plan to cover some of the 47 million uninsured people in the United States, through â€œaffordable choices grantsâ€ù to states.,â€œThese grants would give our nationâ€™s governors more money and more flexibility to give private health insurance to those most in need,â€ù Mr. Bush said.,To help pay for that effort, federal officials said the presidentâ€™s budget would allow states to redirect money out of a Medicaid program, which currently pays billions of dollars to hospitals that care for a disproportionately high share of patients who are uninsured. Most often, these are public hospitals.,States could use the money to cover the uninsured, but it is not clear how much money could be redirected, nor how individual states would respond. Administration officials argue that covering more people will diminish the need for government to compensate hospitals for indigent care. But critics say many poor people would remain uninsured under the presidentâ€™s plan.,Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, a hospital industry group, said, â€œYou cannot rip away the safety net serving society today on the belief that a vision, a new system, will suddenly appear.â€ù,The proposed changes would hit especially hard at the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the nationâ€™s largest state or local health care system, with 11 hospitals and scores of clinics. About 60 percent of its $5 billion annual budget comes from Medicaid â€” more than the Medicaid payments to all hospitals combined in some states. About 30 percent of its patients are uninsured.,The Medicaid rule change announced last week is similar to provisions that the Bush administration has proposed in past yearsâ€™ budget talks, which Congress declined to adopt. But a Medicaid regulation can be made without Congressional approval. State and hospital officials say such a policy would probably be challenged in court, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said that Congress might pass a law to block it.,The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees the program, estimates that the new rule would save about $760 million a year. But officials say there has been no detailed, state-by-state calculation, so the number could change.,Each state sets the rates its Medicaid program pays hospitals and other providers, and for each dollar  spent, it gets matching money from the federal government.,A longstanding Medicaid rule allows state and local governments that own or run hospitals and clinics to receive more money for Medicaid services, beyond what the standard Medicaid rates pay, and draw a federal match on those additional dollars, too. While many public hospitals do not get such supplemental payments from their local government sponsors, New York City contributes hundreds of millions of dollars each year to its hospitals.,In a statement released with the proposed regulation, the administration said that the public hospitals often use the extra payments â€œto subsidize health care operations that are unrelated to Medicaid.â€ù,Deborah Bachrach, New York Stateâ€™s Medicaid director, said that using the money to strengthen â€œsafety netâ€ù hospitals that deliver Medicaid benefits is legitimate, even if some of those benefits go to uninsured patients and others outside Medicaid. And in practice, she said, it is impossible to separate the two. â€œItâ€™s fine to say Medicaid dollars for Medicaid patients, but in reality itâ€™s never that simple,â€ù she said.,The administration statement also alleged outright cheating of the system. â€œWe have identified numerous instances in which health care providers did not retain the full amount of their Medicaid payments but were required to refund or return a portion of the payments receivedâ€ù to the state or local governments, it said. In other words, the supplemental payments made by the state or local governments were a ruse, intended to draw federal matching funds, with the local money eventually being diverted to unrelated uses.,Several lawmakers and hospital industry officials disputed the notion that such abuses are common. Rather, they said, the administration wants to pare services to the poorest of the poor. â€œIf it was for-profit hospitals in Texas, they wouldnâ€™t be doing it,â€ù Mr. Schumer said.,Nationwide, the supplemental Medicaid payments total more than $3 billion a year, most of it federal money, according to the National Association of Public Hospitals. But the proposed rule would make it much harder to collect that money from Washington, in several ways.,Medicaid imposes an upper limit on its payments to each hospital â€” for all services combined, not patient by patient â€” and the new rule would lower that cap.,Some public hospitals in New York turn a small profit on Medicaid inpatient services, and absorb a large loss on Medicaid for outpatients, and report an overall Medicaid loss. That would no longer be allowed under the new rule, which would apply  caps to inpatient and outpatient care, and would forbid any profit.",RICHARD PÃ‰REZ-PEÃ‘A,"JAN. 24, 2007",New York Public Hospitals Fear Proposed Medicaid Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/nyregion/24hhc.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MUNICH, Jan. 23  â€”  A technology and media conference being held here this week provided ample evidence that Silicon Valleyâ€™s dominance of Internet-style technology innovation is waning.,The gathering, Digital Life Design, has become a showcase for a range of European entrepreneurs who have taken the start-up culture pioneered in Silicon Valley as a template and are successfully transplanting it here.,The star of this yearâ€™s event was Niklas Zennstrom, the Swedish co-founder of the file-sharing system Kazaa and the Internet telephony company Skype, which was sold to eBay for $2.6 billion in 2005. Mr. Zennstrom last week took the wraps off a previously secretive start-up, Joost, that intends to provide a peer-to-peer approach to distributing video online.,â€œWeâ€™re trying to take the good things about television and the good things about the Internet and put them together,â€ù he said.,Like many participants here, Mr. Zennstrom voiced the opinion that Internet-based commerce would accelerate in its disruptive effect on traditional businesses. Skype, for example, now says that it carries 4.4 percent of all worldwide long-distance calling.,â€œWe now have a pretty decent Internet infrastructure,â€ù Mr. Zennstrom said, noting in the future that it would give rise to â€œmany, many more disruptive industries.â€ù,The invitation-only conference, which ended Tuesday, attracted 1,000 old- and new-media publishers this year, mixed in with Internet software and service start-ups and a smattering of American dot-com executives. It serves in part as an intelligence-gathering event for its sponsor, Hubert Burda, a German publisher trying to move his more than 250 magazines into the Internet era.,Several organizers noted that Silicon Valleyâ€™s original success as an innovation center was largely because of business and social networks developed over several decades in a community of venture capitalists and technologists.,Now, they said, with the Internet supplementing and replacing traditional face-to-face social networks, Silicon Valley might be losing its competitive advantage.,â€œThe epicenter was Silicon Valley, but that has created a wave of innovation that has now reached the entire world,â€ù said Yossi Vardi, an Israeli entrepreneur and investor who financed his sonâ€™s development of ICQ, an early Internet chat program  later sold to America Online.,Internet start-ups in Europe received a significant boost last month with the initial public offering of Open BC/Xing, a German Web site that is a competitor of the American site LinkedIn for social networking among businesses.,One of the best examples of the diffusion of Internet-style business creation is Tariq Krim, chief executive of Netvibes. His Paris-based company was a pioneer in the design of a Web service that allows users to personalize their start page, shifting the control away from the traditional Internet portal companies.,Netvibes, which received a $15.5 million investment from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Accel Partners last year, now reports 10 million users. The company was an early practitioner of the so-called Web 2.0 approach, which is based on a system of hooking together Internet services provided by competing companies.,After growing up in Paris, Mr. Krim received practical business schooling in Silicon Valley, first as an intern at Sun Microsystems and then, in the late 1990s, as a reporter for a French business magazine based there.,In founding Netvibes in 2005, he said, he was inspired by the simplicity of Appleâ€™s Macintosh and was trying to offer that same ease of use to Internet users.,â€œOur digital life is fragmented into a wide number of services,â€ù he said.,Being based in Paris can sometimes be disorienting, he said, noting that when Netvibes began operating two years ago many people assumed that it was in Silicon Valley.,The company was able to use online collaboration among its users to rapidly translate the service into 80 languages, even though the firm had just four employees initially.,Netvibes recently opened a San Francisco office, and Mr. Krim acknowledged that he was fond of the Silicon Valley culture in which everyone seems to live and breathe computing and technology.,â€œI miss the fact you can start an interesting company just by talking to someone you meet while you are doing your laundry,â€ù he said.,Still, he says that while there are major cultural differences in the way start-up entrepreneurs are viewed in Europe  â€” failure is not viewed as a badge of honor, the way it is in Silicon Valley  â€” a native community is beginning to emerge.,He noted that an early investor in Netvibes was Martin Varsavsky, the Madrid-based investor who recently founded FON, a wireless-networking service based on subsidizing the cost of , modems and building communities of users around the world who freely share wireless access points.,Mr. Varsavsky argues that the new European start-ups are generally more sophisticated than their American competitors.,European Web video sites like Vpod and Sevenload are technically more advanced than YouTube, he said. Sevenload combines the features of Flickr, which allows sharing of still photos, and YouTube, the video sharing site.,Other European start-up companies whose executives attended the conference included Rebtel and Truphone, which are offering low-cost Internet calls to cellphone users. Another European start-up, JaJa, is also pursuing the market.,â€œWe have built Wi-Fi infrastructure at home and in the office and we are still using our cellphones,â€ù said Alexander Straub, a German entrepreneur based in London who founded Truphone last year. He said the roaming charges levied by cellular companies were not sustainable. â€œItâ€™s pure robbery,â€ù he said.,A number of participants at the conference contended that with the quick spread of ideas in an Internet age, Silicon Valley companies no longer have a first-mover advantage.,Gerald Haag, a former Amazon executive who is a founder of Dropshop, a Munich-based start-up for auction sellers, cited a case in which an idea from Silicon Valley was introduced in Europe.

"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 23 â€” After years of losses, Sun Microsystems returned to profitability last quarter, while Advanced Micro Devices swung to a loss, providing evidence that the road to recovery in the technology industry is a bumpy one.,â€œItâ€™s great to be profitable again,â€ù Jonathan I. Schwartz, chief executive of Sun, whose string of losses had once led analysts to question the companyâ€™s ability to survive, told analysts in a conference call. â€œSunâ€™s financial performance this quarter demonstrates that our strategy and discipline are paying off.â€ù,In contrast, Advanced Micro Devices, the computer chip maker, reported a $574 million loss, in contrast to a $96 million profit in the quarter a year earlier. Ten days ago, it warned investors that lower prices had hurt its bottom line, a result of a bruising price war with its larger rival, Intel.,On Monday, Intel announced a deal to become a second outside supplier of server chips to Sun, entering territory that A.M.D. had long claimed for itself. Sun also announced on Tuesday that the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company would make a $700 million investment in the company in the form of convertible senior notes.,Sunâ€™s net income for the quarter, the second of its fiscal year, was $126 million, or 3 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $223 million, or 7 cents a share, for the period last year. The latest result  beat analystsâ€™ forecasts.,Revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 7 percent over the $3.3 billion reported for the second quarter last year. Sun attributed the growth to server sales, as well as strong acceptance of Solaris, Sunâ€™s computer operating system. Revenue in Sunâ€™s computer systems products unit increased 14 percent, the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, the company said.,Sunâ€™s net income for the second quarter included $58 million of stock-based compensation charges, $26 million of restructuring and related charges and a tax benefit of $4 million. The impact of these three items was a loss of about 2 cents a share.,Shares of Sun rose as much as 8 percent, or 46 cents, to $6.12 in late trading after the report was issued, after declining 9 cents, to $5.66, during regular trading.,â€œItâ€™s an important milestone,â€ù said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. â€œThey are well on their way to executing a turnaround.â€ù Mr. Bracelin said that the challenge now would be for Sun to keep costs down as it headed aggressively into volume markets, where profit margins were lower.,While the Sun-Intel deal announced Monday had no impact during the December quarter, it serves as an illustration of A.M.D.â€™s precarious position as it tries to hold on to the market share gains of the past year.,A.M.D. has spent several quarters embroiled in a fierce price war with Intel in an effort to gain market share, particularly as Intel introduced its new line of high-performance chips.,A.M.D. said shipments of its server processors, which have the highest profit margins, were essentially flat with the previous quarter, while the average selling prices for those chips were down significantly. The company said, however, that overall microprocessor shipments increased 26 percent .,A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., posted a net loss of $574 million, or $1.08 a share, for the quarter, the fourth of its fiscal year. For the same quarter last year, A.M.D. earned $96 million, or 21 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter was $1.77 billion, compared with $1.84 billion at the same time last year.,In addition to the price war with Intel, A.M.D. also attributed its lower profit to heavy costs associated with its $5.4 billion acquisition of ATI Technologies, the graphics chip maker it acquired in October. Excluding those costs, as well as employee stock-based compensation expenses, A.M.D. reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.37 billion, compared with $1.35 billion last year.,Shares of A.M.D. declined as much as 5 percent in after-hours trading after release of its earnings report; they declined 2 cents, to close at $17.51, in regular trading. A.M.D.â€™s warning on Jan. 12 sent its shares down $1.91, or 9 percent, to $18.27, and led several Wall Street investment firms to lower their ratings of A.M.D.,Hector Ruiz, A.M.D.â€™s chief executive, said he expected the price war with Intel to continue. â€œPricing is very, very challenging and we expect it to be for all of the year,â€ù Mr. Ruiz told analysts.,He said the company was focused on reducing costs, as well as on the new chip design it planned to introduce later in the year. The company is also moving to an advanced manufacturing technology that could help make it more competitive with Intel, which is in the midst of a manufacturing transition of its own.,For the year, A.M.D. lost $166 million, or 34 cents a share, on $5.65 billion in revenue.

Employees say it is unsafe and complain that their opinions are dismissed, and others worry that the children remain in custody far too long.,Then last month a report concluded that there were major gaps in communication among management and the psychiatrists, pediatricians and nurses who work at the facility, Riverview Hospital.,On Tuesday, a group of state legislators added to the chorus of dissatisfaction, saying they were eager to see improvements more quickly at Riverview, the only publicly run facility in the state for children with severe mental problems.,â€œWe come out of this knowing that things are not where they should be, but there is improvement,â€ù said State Senator Edward Meyer, the chairman of the committee that held the hearing.,After a stream of complaints from the staff and others, the superintendent stepped down in October. So far, state officials have made little progress finding a permanent replacement.,The commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, Darlene Dunbar â€” who herself is expected to be replaced by Gov. M. Jodi Rell â€” said at the hearing that the only viable candidate recently withdrew. And the department, which oversees Riverview and several other facilities, has had several problems in recent years: There have been reports of violence at some places, and other sites that have cared for troubled children have shut down.,â€œHow can you have accountability when you donâ€™t know who should be held accountable?â€ù Mr. Meyer asked. Many critics at Tuesdayâ€™s hearing said the problems had deepened in recent years because of friction between management and staff.,â€œThere is no vision and nobody making it clear what the hospital is meant to do,â€ù said Jeanne Milstein, the stateâ€™s child advocate.,Ms. Milstein pointed to some children staying in the hospital for more than a year, without plans for their release to a less restrictive setting.,While the number of violent episodes reported by administrators at Riverview had declined in recent months, the report issued last month said that there were â€œsplits at all levelsâ€ù that made it difficult to make changes at the hospital.,While several leaders, including Ms. Dunbar, have advocated using fewer physical restraints, in part to limit violent outbursts, the report found that there has been resistance among some staff members.,Richard Liburdi, a childrenâ€™s service worker at the hospital and one of several staff members at Tuesdayâ€™s hearing, said many of his colleagues felt their professional opinions were being disregarded. He described one case in which a teenage girl was moved against the advice of a psychiatrist who had worked with her for several months.,Later, Mr. Liburdi said, the girl lashed out at some staff members and had to be restrained.,Despite the criticisms, Ms. Dunbar said that she was confident that the latest report had provided the management and staff with a â€œroad mapâ€ù for what to do next.,â€œWill this be overnight? No,â€ù she told the group of lawmakers. â€œBut it is not as if you are coming to us and we donâ€™t know what to do. We do have a plan.â€ù",JENNIFER MEDINA,"JAN. 24, 2007",Changes Sought at Childrenâ€™s Psychiatric Hospital,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/nyregion/24hospital.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit dropped 24 percent, pulled down by a higher revamping charge, but it still beat analystsâ€™ expectations. Net income fell to $214 million, or 22 cents a share, from $282 million, or 27 cents a share, in the same period in 2005.,The company said its latest re sults included a revamping charge of $160 million, or 16 cents a share. Excluding that charge, adjusted earnings were 38 cents a share, compared with 32 cents a share a year earlier.,On that basis, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 37 cents a share.,Shares of Xerox traded at $16.53 yesterday afternoon, down 17 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.,Total revenue for the quarter rose to $4.38 billion, up 3 percent from $4.25 billion a year earlier.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"JAN. 24, 2007",Profit at Xerox Declines,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/business/24xerox.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yahoo closed the books on a tough year yesterday, reporting that its sales rebounded in the fourth quarter from an especially sluggish third quarter and promising investors that it would soon turn on technology that it hoped would close the widening gap with Google.,Its fourth-quarter profits were down from a year ago when it had investment gains, however, and it predicted only modest improvements for this year, suggesting that Yahoo would continue to struggle to keep up with Google, its Silicon Valley rival.,Yahoo executives were upbeat enough, however, that Yahooâ€™s shares rose by 5.8 percent, or $1.57, in after-hours trading, to $28.53. The price had fallen 46 cents, to $26.96 in regular trading.,Of most significance to investors, Yahoo said it would begin the second phase of its long-delayed search advertising system, called Project Panama, on Feb. 5. On that day, it will start displaying advertising on search pages in the order in which its computers estimate it will make the most money.,Search advertisers bid the price they are willing to pay each time a user clicks to visit their Web sites. Yahoo now shows the highest bid first, a method that analysts say earned it only 60 percent as much on each search as Googleâ€™s more sophisticated formula. Terry S. Semel, Yahooâ€™s chief executive, said the company would reap the rewards of the new system â€” but slowly.,â€œThe first time we see any benefit will be at the end of the second quarter,â€ù he said in an interview yesterday. â€œEvery quarter thereafter we will start to get better.â€ù,Mr. Semel said Yahoo would not see the full impact until 2008, when the system will be expanded to international markets.,In the fourth quarter, Yahoo earned $268.7 million, or 19 cents a share, down from $683.2 million, or 46 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Yahooâ€™s earnings were buoyed by $408 million in accounting adjustments relating to the sale of its Chinese unit and some tax changes. Excluding those adjustments and some expenses related to stock-based compensation, Yahooâ€™s fourth-quarter  income in 2006 was $296.5 million, up 15 percent from the prior year.,Yahoo predicted another slow year of growth. The companyâ€™s revenue, after deducting payments it makes to Web sites that display the ads it sells, was $4.56 billion for 2006, an increase of 23 percent over 2005. (The growth was slower than the company had predicted at this time last year.) For next year, it predicts net revenue of $4.95 billion to $5.45 billion, an increase of 8.6 percent to  20 percent.,It also expects the growth rate in operating cash flow, a measure of profitability, to slow as well.,By contrast, Google is expected to announce next week that its 2006 net revenue was up 85 percent, to $7.45 billion. And analysts expect its net revenue to increase 48 percent this year.,For the fourth quarter, Yahoo reported revenue, excluding payments to other sites, of $1.23 billion, up 15 percent. Yahooâ€™s revenue was slightly higher than analystsâ€™ expectations of $1.22 billion. Its per-share earning of 19 cents in the quarter was well ahead of the 13 cents expected by Wall Street.,As Yahoo has fallen further behind Google, there has been increasing criticism of Mr. Semelâ€™s leadership as slow, indecisive and unfocused. In response, last month Mr. Semel reorganized the companyâ€™s management, placing responsibility for advertising sales and some other business under Susan L. Decker, formerly the companyâ€™s chief financial officer.,In a conference call with investors, Ms. Decker said that Yahoo planned to rebuild its business of selling advertising for other sites, both text ads related to Web searches and graphic banner ads. In recent years, Yahoo has lost its early lead in the search ad business to Google. And while it is still the largest seller of display advertising on its own site, AOLâ€™s Advertising.com unit has become the largest network selling graphical display advertising for other sites.,Mr. Semel said the Panama system would allow advertisers to buy both graphic and search advertising at one time, something that Yahoo had not allowed until now.,â€œLarge advertisers want to talk about display advertising and search at the same time in the same meeting,â€ù he said.,Mr. Semel said that Yahoo was buying advertising space on other sites on behalf of its large customers, using an advertising marketplace run by Right Media.,Yahoo is looking to sell ads on other sites in part because the growth of its own user base is slowing. Yahoo increased its user base in 2006 by 16 percent, to 423 million people worldwide, but the growth rate of users in 2005 was 22 percent. Yahooâ€™s users are looking at more pages than they did a year ago, but the companyâ€™s advertising revenue for each page displayed declined, it said, mainly because of  its lagging search ad technology.,In the United States, Yahooâ€™s revenue grew to $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 8 percent from the quarter a year ago. By contrast, the companyâ€™s strong business in Asia helped its international revenue grow at a 25 percent pace, to $558 million.",SAUL HANSELL,"JAN. 24, 2007","Profit Down, Outlook Up at Yahoo",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/technology/24yahoo.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Former Mayor , has recently taken steps to sell the biggest division of his consulting business as he considers running for the presidency, according to a person with detailed knowledge of the firmâ€™s plans.,The sale of the division, Giuliani Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank, is being pursued to prevent its clientsâ€™ activities from being used against Mr. Giuliani in a heated political campaign, said that person, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.,The same could be said about Giuliani Partnersâ€™ clients, which have included companies embroiled in accounting scandals, and about Bracewell & Giuliani, a Houston law firm that Mr. Giuliani joined in 2005 that represents energy producers often accused of being major polluters.,The possible sale, first reported yesterday by The New York Post, is one more indication that Mr. Giuliani is moving toward running for president. Mr. Giuliani has put off moving from an exploratory phase to formally announcing his candidacy. Aides have recently said a decision could be months away. Mr. Giuliani declined to comment, a spokeswoman for him said.,Joseph Mercurio, a political consultant, said he believed that Mr. Giuliani was heading toward a run, but he said that the moves on the corporate front did not relieve his more immediate difficulty: that his support of , rights, gay civil unions and gun control would be likely to trouble core voters in a Republican primary.,â€œI think heâ€™s running. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any question about that,â€ù said Mr. Mercurio, who has represented both Democratic and Republican candidates. â€œThe only question is, given his policies and positions on issues, can he run very far?â€ù,The possible sale of the investment bank appears to have been considered only in recent weeks. During extensive interviews earlier this month about the firmâ€™s future, Mr. Giulianiâ€™s top aides said nothing of that order was under consideration.,The sale would greatly diminish the size of Mr. Giulianiâ€™s consulting business, cutting its overall revenue by as much as half and reducing the employee count by nearly 60 percent. Such a move would leave Giuliani Partners, which has about 60 employees and 12 to 20 clients, and Giuliani Security and Safety, which has only 10 employees and an unknown number of clients. Such a sale would likely further amplify questions, already hotly discussed both inside and outside the Giuliani offices, about whether any of the businesses could survive the departure of Mr. Giuliani and the key executives who would be expected to join his campaign.,In December 2004, Giuliani Partners bought the firm from Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, for $9.8 million. Under Ernst & Young, the firm reported revenues of $85 million in the 2004 fiscal year and $76 million in the 2002 fiscal year (its publicly available filings for the 2003 fiscal year are incomplete), or about $6.7 million a month.,During the last five months that Ernst & Young owned the firm, its revenues dropped to $3.3 million a month. In 2005, the first year under Giuliani ownership, revenues rose to about $4 million a month.,The firm has not yet reported its 2006 revenues. But based on the 2005 figures, Giuliani Capital Advisors could fetch in the neighborhood of $80 million to $100 million and would likely generate considerable interest, said Matthew A. Litfin, an analyst who covers the industry for William Blair & Company, a Chicago-based investment firm.,â€œFor a company like Giuliani Capital Advisors, I think there would be a premium paid because they are quite balanced across different industries and their people are known for being high quality,â€ù said Mr. Litfin.,Steven D. Oesterle, a partner in Giuliani Partners and chairman of the investment bank, said three weeks ago that Capital Advisors had replaced most of eight managing directors who left last year, and had a bright future.  â€œThe firm is in a strong and profitable financial position,â€ù he said.",RUSS BUETTNER,"JAN. 24, 2007",Giuliani Is Expected to Sell One of His Three Businesses,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/us/politics/24rudy.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"TO get to Mo Gridderâ€™s BBQ, go to the Bronx, then head to Hunts Point Avenue. Drive east under the Bruckner, through the more residential part of Hunts Point, where I spied a stroller tangled in barbed wire atop a rusted fence, where tied-together sneakers hung slung over tree branches overhead and where a wizened, weathered Chihuahua, loitering outside a bodega, eyed passers-by with suspicion.,Keep going. The street slopes down at Lafayette Avenue, into blocks and blocks of auto repair businesses. If you pass Max A. Millionâ€™s Mr. Wedge strip club (where boxing strippers were once an attraction) youâ€™re almost there.,When the weather is good, keep an eye out for the Mo Gridder rig, which will be proudly parked out in front of Hunts Point Auto Sales and Service. (If not, it will be tucked away from the elements on a lot in the back.),Itâ€™s a sight to behold: a 35-foot-long fire-engine-red competition-ready barbecue trailer. Tacked onto one end is a Southern Pride 500 barbecue pit, a piece of equipment fearsome enough to impress even the most casual rib eater. A cartoon mural of a hillbilly, shotgun in hand, in pursuit of a fleeing pig astraddle a cow, is painted on the side.,Fred Donnelly is the man behind Mo Gridderâ€™s. Itâ€™s his trailer and his â€™cue, and the office of his auto repair business doubles as the dining room. (Itâ€™s his name, too â€” Mo Gridder was a childhood nickname.) â€œMoGridderâ€™s World Famous Smoked BBQ,â€ù it reads on the big sign out front, below the auto shopâ€™s name, â€œ,.â€ù,A television set is in the corner, a fresh bottle of sauce is on each of the few tidy tables and a desk is in the corner where you can inquire about auto insurance claims.,Though the big red machine outside has been smoking only since May, Mr. Donnelly said he has been â€œdoing barbecueâ€ù since 1992. It was a good way â€œto show some customer appreciationâ€ù at this location and at his used car lot. Heâ€™s gotten serious over the years, becoming a certified barbecue judge, competing around the country and now staking a claim for real barbecue in the Bronx.,His menu is expansive, much like those at other New York barbecue spots. And much like the food at other New York barbecue spots, not everything is magic.,But the ribs: thatâ€™s where the getting gets good.,The ribs are St. Louis cut â€” from the middle of a rack of spareribs â€” and they are dry-rubbed before a six-hour snooze in the Southern Pride.,Mr. Donnelly said cherry and apple woods are his main smoke makers, that they impart a subtler flavor than hickory, which he sometimes throws into the mix, too. Whatever the fuel, the meat is sweetly and amply imbued with smoky flavor by the time itâ€™s in your hands.,The meat on the ribs â€” and the ribs are meaty â€” has a yielding tenderness, but none of the falling-off-the-bone toothlessness of lesser barbecue.,Barbecued ribs are supposed to be meat, not pablum, and the crew at Mo Gridderâ€™s gets that. They paint the ribs with a slick of sauce before reheating them on the charcoal grill inside the rig, which gently intensifies the flavors of the sauce and ever so slightly crisps the outer flesh of the ribs.,Maybe only the most hard-core barbecue fans will trek to Hunts Point to decide whether Mo Gridderâ€™s ribs are among the cityâ€™s best.,But with a side of sweet barbecued beans and coleslaw that could double as mayonnaise soup, those ribs make for a mighty fine lunch.,And the place has a charm all its own.

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 â€” President Bush delivered a domestic agenda to Congressional Democrats on Tuesday that was, in large part, modest and a reiteration of past proposals. Where he did break ground â€” on health care â€” his initiative was quickly dismissed by leading Democrats and seemed unlikely to form the basis of bipartisan action.,There were some notable omissions in Mr. Bushâ€™s speech. He did not offer a new proposal for dealing with the long-term financial problems in Medicare and Social Security, although he again identified those entitlement programs as a challenge that must be confronted. Nor did he make the grand gesture that might have spurred Congressional Democrats into the bipartisan talks on entitlements that administration officials insist they want.,Mr. Bush renewed his call for an overhaul of , laws, considered one of his best chances to accomplish something big in the current Congress. But in general, his domestic agenda reflected the political constraints of a conservative second-term president facing a newly empowered Democratic-led Congress.,Aside from energy, the major focus of Mr. Bushâ€™s domestic proposals was an effort to expand access to affordable health insurance, by creating a new tax benefit for those buying insurance on their own rather than through their employer. The new benefit would be part of a sweeping change in the tax code under which employer-provided health insurance, which is how more than half of Americans get their coverage, would be treated as taxable income. For decades, those benefits have been exempt from income and payroll taxes.,In effect, the president is proposing a new standard deduction for health insurance â€” $15,000 for families and $7,500 for individuals. That would mean lower taxes for more than 100 million Americans with employer-provided coverage worth less than the standard deduction, Mr. Bush said. But it would raise taxes for about 30 million people with more expensive plans, unless they switched to less costly alternatives, White House officials said.,Mr. Bush said the tax proposal was an effort to â€œlevel the playing fieldâ€ù between Americans buying insurance on their own and those who get it through their employers. â€œFor the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach,â€ù he said. â€œChanging the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.â€ù,Democrats, labor unions and some consumer advocates said the proposal would shake the foundations of the nationâ€™s health insurance system, still largely built around the workplace.,Congressional Democrats described the plan as a middle-class tax increase that would penalize people with good health benefits. They praised the new focus on health care, but said the Bush proposal was more likely to yield partisan debate than a search for consensus.,â€œItâ€™s difficult to imagine a proposal like this making it through the House or the Senate,â€ù said a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.,Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, â€œI cannot conceive of this as an olive branch, as an attempt to get something done.â€ù,Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said his panel would not consider Mr. Bushâ€™s proposal.,Prospects were less grim for immigration legislation. Mr. Bush renewed his push for a law that would toughen border security, grant legal status to the nationâ€™s illegal immigrants and create a temporary worker program to ensure a steady flow of foreign workers to businesses.,The proposal, which would also toughen criminal and financial penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants, has a much stronger chance of passage in a Democratic-led Congress this year than it did when Republicans were in control, lawmakers of both parties say.,Leading Democrats in the Senate, who have consulted with Mr. Bush in recent weeks, expect to introduce legislation next month. House Democrats expect to follow.,But passage is far from assured. The A.F.L-C.I.O, which is expected to have more leverage in this Congress, is determined to scuttle the temporary worker program, saying it threatens to replace American workers with foreigners. Administration officials emphasized on Tuesday that the program would have to be â€œtruly temporary,â€ù which left some advocates for immigrants concerned that Mr. Bush might oppose a path to permanent residency or citizenship for temporary workers.,And some moderate Democrats, along with conservative Republicans, strongly oppose proposals that would legalize illegal immigrants, saying they amount to an amnesty for lawbreakers.,Still, critics and proponents of the legislation alike agree that this year offers Mr. Bush his best opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus on the issue. His focus on the need for immigrants to assimilate â€” by learning English and integrating more deeply into American society â€” may be intended to help ease concerns among some of his Republican supporters and some moderate Democrats.,Mr. Bush also returned to the signature bipartisan accomplishment of his first term, the No Child Left Behind legislation that requires schools to demonstrate yearly progress in studentsâ€™ achievements. He urged Congress to renew the law.","ROBIN TONER,ROBERT PEAR","JAN. 24, 2007",Bush Revives Some Past Proposals and Offers a New Initiative on Health Insurance,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/washington/24domestic.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First, dear, a quibble: Demi? On the ,? Back when she was large (and naked!) with a child destined for a nutty celebrity-spawn name, it made sense. But if â€œBobbyâ€ù is a comeback, I went to a state university.,Now, applause: Waverly. Love it. I laugh when I hear it called a restaurant, as if it were anything so mundane and (apologies to Demi) pregnable. How can they call it a restaurant when the official phone number yields a recording that doesnâ€™t take messages or even acknowledge that the place  has opened?  Of course, , all been eating there since early November. It just isnâ€™t open to anyone and everyone.,Someday it will surely have to be. Someday the people who know you and the people who know your key staff members and the recognizable or attractive people who take the trouble to stop in, willing to submit to a visual once-over and try to make a reservation in person  â€” someday there wonâ€™t be enough of these people to fill the seats, and youâ€™ll have to take all callers and comers, and it will all be so much different.,But for now, well, we have a Toots Shorâ€™s of our own, a Stork Club without the plumage. I think back to that night in London at the Groucho Club (remember how everyone was trying not to stare at Martin Amisâ€™s new teeth?!) and how we agreed that New York needed an English gentlemenâ€™s club that didnâ€™t take English gentlemen as members.,You could write the book on playing coy. Or at least a key chapter in the annals of playing coy. The big red letters saying â€œpreviewâ€ù on not only every page of the menu but also on every page of the wine list? The constant public nattering about the Edward Sorel mural not being done? (Looked good to me.) The refusal to let newspapers and magazines take pictures beyond the front bar area, as if there were still dropcloths and paint cans scattered about?,Brilliant. Just brilliant. I heard you even held your ground with The Times, denying the photographer access to the dining rooms. How in the world will they get around that?,I dropped in the other night. My eleventh visit, I think. (Is there some kind of frequent flier program? Kidding! But if there is. ...  ) That front bar area was poignant: all those strivers with Blackberries but without reservations, waiting for a tap on the shoulder that would never come. I heard a woman who did have a reservation  â€” her table wasnâ€™t ready â€” tell her companion that they should sell it on eBay.  Thereâ€™s a traitor in our midst.,No wonder so many want in so badly. If our house up in Rhinebeck had the coziness that Waverly does, I wouldnâ€™t make Herbert go up there alone as often as I do. The quaintly uneven  wood floors, the low ceilings, the four fireplaces, the red banquettes: Waverly is like a rumpled, wrinkled dowager who  found some late-in-life glamour, who   got a great tailor and the best laser peel money could buy.,What was it before? Ye Waverly Inn? Graydon, ye somehow managed to keep the sense that it dates back to the 1920s while losing the mustiness. Everything about it, and everyone in it, glows. I even like the rear garden, with its high glass ceiling, handsome brick walls and forest of plants. Siberia was never so verdant.,Iâ€™ve dawdled in getting to the food, because I hate to complain. But does it have to be this good, Graydon? Isnâ€™t that a strategic blunder?,When word gets out that your chef, John DeLucie, is doing some of the best tuna tartare in town (all that creamy avocado and zingy  heat!), plus a hefty and juicy pork chop, a classically blissful Dover sole, an addictive clam chowder, a gorgeous fillet of wild salmon (with those adorable little beluga lentils) and such feloniously fatty short ribs, wonâ€™t there be even more lemmings tumbling down the steps from Bank Street and through the door?,Wonâ€™t we have some of the Little Owl and August crowds on top of the folks whoâ€™d mow down their grandmothers for invitations to the Vanity Fair Oscar party?,Sure, this isnâ€™t attention-getting cuisine. It doesnâ€™t take much to steam an artichoke or whip up chicken liver mousse. The world could do without one more frisÃ©e aux lardons, one more blizzard of goat cheese (yes, I saw, ,goat cheese) on one more landscape of crimson beets. Apple crisp and crÃ¨me caramel arenâ€™t paths to Epicurean glory.,But Iâ€™ve been to Cafe Cluny, and it doesnâ€™t pull off a similarly modest menu of comforting favorites as well. Except for the dull chicken pot pie and the humdrum crab cakes and the functional strip steak, Waverly is like the cooking Iâ€™d do at home, if I had the time and, well, O.K., if I could cook.,And itâ€™s not just me who thinks so. I heard this drone at a nearby table prattling to his hostages â€” excuse me,  , â€” about the crispness of the Amish free-range chickenâ€™s skin and how the bird had real flavor and how the moist meat was a barometer of a conscientious kitchen. What was he? A restaurant critic?,He actually asked if the $55 macaroni and cheese with shaved white truffles could be ordered without the truffles. He didnâ€™t get it. The whole point is the  comedy of getting â€” and being seen getting â€” something so absurdly costly. No truffles, no deal.,No kidding, Graydon, Waverly is sweet. Itâ€™s not just about an A-list daisy chain of writers, actors, models. Itâ€™s not just about ringside seats to the latest Perelman-Barkin smackdown.,Itâ€™s about the ease and privilege of being among people who reflect your brainiest, prettiest sense of self.

"Are biotechnology companies reaching the limits of how much they can charge for their drugs? One sign of that is the sluggish sales of drugs for psoriasis.,When the biotech industry began rolling out psoriasis drugs a few years ago, experts heralded the new medications as safer, more effective treatments for the skin disease. And the companies  â€” Amgen, Genentech and Biogen Idec, arguably the industryâ€™s best-known firms  â€”  forecast a repeat of the success they have had with similarly priced drugs for rheumatoid ,, , and ,.,But they may have overestimated the medical establishmentâ€™s willingness to spend $10,000 to $35,000 a year on treatments for psoriasis, a condition that is often, though incorrectly, perceived as merely a cosmetic problem.,Many insurers are insisting that psoriasis patients try older, cheaper therapies first before approving reimbursement of a biotech drug, frustrating some doctors and patients.,Dr. Mark G. Lebwohl, chairman of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and a consultant to many of the drug developers, said he grew so frustrated he had sought help from the New York attorney generalâ€™s office on a number of occasions to persuade insurance companies to pay for the drugs. The tactic usually worked, he said.,Price is not the only barrier. Dermatologists, many of whom prefer doing lucrative Botox procedures to treating psoriasis, worry about the side effects of the drugs, not to mention the vexation of trying to help patients seek insurance reimbursement. â€œIn todayâ€™s market I can see four acne patients in the time I see one patient on biologics,â€ùâ€™ said Dr. William Abramovits, a professor of dermatology at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, referring to the biotech psoriasis drugs, which he prescribes despite the obstacles.,Even many patients seem to have little enthusiasm for the drugs, which users typically take by injecting themselves as often as twice a week.,â€œHave drugs, need patients,â€ùâ€™ said Dr. Craig Leonardi, a St. Louis dermatologist who is a consultant to many of the drug developers.,Amgen, which sells the fieldâ€™s leader, Enbrel, estimates there are 1.1 million Americans with severe enough psoriasis to warrant one of the biotechnology drugs, which are called biologics because they are manufactured in cultures of living cells. But the company estimates that only about 60,000 people are using one of the drugs.,Psoriasis can be far more than the bad case of dandruff that might come to mind for people old enough to recall a vintage shampoo commercial that lamented â€œthe heartbreak of psoriasis.â€ù,An autoimmune disease, in which the bodyâ€™s defenses mistakenly attack the skin, psoriasis is marked by red, scaly patches that can be itchy or painful. And because of its potential impact on a patientâ€™s social or sexual life, psoriasis can cause severe emotional distress. In some cases the condition is linked to a joint disease known as psoriatic arthritis.,The sluggish sales of the biotech drugs have already started taking a toll on their makers.,Biogen Idec, which introduced the first biologic for psoriasis in 2003, has already given up, divesting its drug to Astellas Pharma, a Japanese pharmaceutical company.  The drug, Amevive, had sales of only $48.5 million in 2005.,Raptiva from Genentech, which was approved later in 2003, had $90 million in sales last year, up 14 percent from 2005. That makes the drug a laggard by that companyâ€™s standards. Its new eye drug, Lucentis, for instance, had $153 million in sales in just its first three months on the market.,Raptivaâ€™s sluggish sales have also dashed the hopes of Xoma, a small company that helped develop the drug and had hoped to become profitable from its share of the proceeds.,Both Amevive and Raptiva lost out to  Enbrel, which many doctors perceive as more effective. But even Enbrel is â€œnot meeting expectations, despite considerable effort,â€ù George Morrow, an executive vice president at Amgen, told analysts recently.,Enbrel sales in North America did rise 10 percent in the first nine months of last  year, to $2.1 billion. But that is down from 35 percent growth in 2005 and is likely to leave 2006 sales less than $3 billion, a figure Amgen had originally expected to reach by 2005.,Wyeth helps market the drug in North America and handles overseas sales by itself.,One reason for the slowdown is that Enbrel is losing market share for its main use  â€” as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a different autoimmune disease, which accounts for as much as 70 percent of  its sales. But another factor is slow growth of the psoriasis market, which accounts for much of the rest.,Amgen is trying to underline the seriousness of the disease with television commercials using the theme â€œEnough is enough.â€ù,The ads do not  mention Enbrel by name. A previous commercial that did was withdrawn in 2005 after the Food and Drug Administration warned that the ad â€” which featured actors with perfect skin frolicking on the beach â€” exaggerated the drugâ€™s effectiveness and underplayed its risks.,Adhering to voluntary industry guidelines, Amgen is discussing with the F.D.A. proposed new ads that mention Enbrel.,Manufacturers say they remain enthusiastic, though. And indeed, the market is getting more crowded.,A Johnson & Johnson drug, Remicade, already used for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohnâ€™s disease, won approval for psoriasis in September. Humira, from Abbott Laboratories, is approved for psoriatic arthritis and is now being tested for psoriasis itself.,Several doctors said those two new drugs appeared more effective than Enbrel at clearing skin. But they also have sterner warnings about side effects, though all three drugs have similar risks. Because they block part of the immune system, the drugs leave patients more vulnerable to infections and possibly some types of cancer.,The other, older drugs to treat moderate to severe psoriasis include the generic immune suppressors methotrexate and cyclosporine. But methotrexate, which can cost as little as $600 a year, can damage the liver,  and cyclosporine, which costs a few thousand dollars a year, can harm the kidneys.,Another option is phototherapy, in which the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light. While effective, it can require three visits a week to a doctorâ€™s office, often for about three to four months a year, sometimes longer.,Factoring in the cost of the biologics and their success rate in clearing skin, researchers at Wake Forest University and elsewhere found the drugs to be the least cost-effective. They cost from $24,000 to $45,000 a year for every patient who achieves a 75 percent reduction in psoriasis severity.,Achieving similar reductions with methotrexate costs less than $2,500 a year and with phototherapy, $3,000 to $7,500. The study was sponsored by Connetics, a maker of an older psoriasis drug.,Insurers are usually requiring â€œstep therapy,â€ù in which patients must try the less expensive therapies first.,Bill Fatland is one of the patients unhappy with that approach. Mr.  Fatland, 56, who has had psoriasis for more than 30 years, said he had used various  creams, but avoided drugs like methotrexate, fearing their side effects. His psoriasis was never under satisfactory control.,About three years ago Mr. Fatland,  a retired teacher who lives in Tigard, Ore., tried Enbrel in a clinical trial. â€œIt was like a miracle,â€ù he said. â€œPretty much looking at me, you wouldnâ€™t know I had psoriasis anymore.â€ù,But when the trial ended, his insurer, Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oregon, declined to cover the drug unless he tried cheaper therapies first. Over the next two years, Mr. Fatland tried phototherapy twice and methotrexate, but they caused rashes. Only after many appeals, he said, did the insurer approve Enbrel.,Even when biologics are reimbursed, though, the co-payment can be high. Vicky Wheeler, an  administrator at a consulting firm in Burlingame, Calif., said her Health Net insurance paid for Enbrel in 2005 without requiring any co-payment.,But last year the policy switched to a 30 percent co-payment for self-injected drugs, and she began paying nearly $400 a month. As a result, she and her doctor cut her dose in half, which they had been considering doing anyway. And she found a charity that provided $1,400 of her annual co-payments.,Hoping to ease reimbursement, the National Psoriasis Foundation, a patient advocacy group, and the American Academy of Dermatology, a professional society, held a â€œsummit on psoriasisâ€ù for insurers in Philadelphia on Nov. 9.,But for all the efforts by the drug makers, many dermatologists are still not comfortable using any drug other than a topical cream. And some patients might not realize new treatments are available, or do not seek them out, said Liz Horn, director of research for the psoriasis foundation.,â€œSome patients,â€ù Ms. Horn said, â€œhave just sort of accepted that they will have psoriasis and this is what itâ€™s going to be like.â€ù",ANDREW POLLACK,"JAN. 24, 2007",Biotech Psoriasis Drugs Hit a Cost Ceiling,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/business/24rash.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sophoclesâ€™ â€œWomen of Trachisâ€ù is packed with sex, gore, desperation and verbal beauty. If it isnâ€™t staged very often, one reason is that the   plot hinges on a twist that is hard to swallow today. Why would Deianira, Heraclesâ€™  adoring and sensible wife, believe that such a glaringly suspicious character â€” a centaur that Heracles shot for trying to rape her â€” would then want to help the couple stay together by giving Deianira a magical love potion?,In Kate E. Ryanâ€™s delightful and perceptive contemporary adaptation, directed by Alice Reagan and produced by Target Margin Theater as part of its Hellenic Laboratory series, obliviousness becomes the playâ€™s central theme, elevated to a kind of hubris. Deianira, played with fabulously distracted lucidity by Heidi Schreck, is a desperate housewife-cum-celebrity-spouse in a sleek, leopard-print dress, who literally itches with longing for her roving-eyed, absentee husband.,The chorus consists of three dreamy, immature young women  (Birgit Huppuch, Jodi Lin and Rebecca Lingafelter) in pink dresses and flower bracelets, who drink Diet Coke out of a plastic cooler and react to the increasingly serious situation with twittering, trivialities and bromides. Itâ€™s never quite clear why such a smart, worldly queen would surround herself with such airheads, but that problem fades away in the end because the point apparently is that obtuseness, whatever its source, is fatal, particularly to women.,Ms. Ryan is far from the first playwright to update a Greek play with pop songs, casual modern speech and references to things like Xanax and computer games. Thereâ€™s a special psychological alertness and pungency to this mÃ©lange, though, that Ms. Reagan shrewdly strengthens in her superbly cast and infectiously energetic one-hour production.,The two roles deliciously played by Debargo Sanyal â€” the royal son Hyllus,  as a snooty teenager in a golf shirt and hiking boots, and the royal gofer Lichas, as a snide celebrity assistant in white glasses and shoes â€” are reason enough to see the show.,My one dramaturgical quibble is with the reductive portrayal, in the final scene, of Heracles (Todd dâ€™Amour) dying when the supposed love potion turns out to be poison. Portraying him  merely as a  bad daddy and a serial adulterer with a secret taste for genital mutilation reads as a cheap shot  beside all Ms. Ryanâ€™s other whimsically acute decisions. Luckily, the swipe is fleeting, and never completely drains the ending  of its hard-earned gravity.",JONATHAN KALB,"JAN. 24, 2007","Greek Tragedy Wears a New, Brash Mask",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/theater/reviews/24trac.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arthur Agatston, the South Beach , doctor, came to town last week and, in between bites of filleted  fish, he was trying to persuade me that his patients rarely have heart attacks anymore.,As he is quick to tell almost anyone â€” as he told me before we had even sat down for our Greek lunch â€” he is an accidental diet doctor. By training, heâ€™s a cardiologist. He spent 20 years doing research and seeing patients in Miami before his little nutrition manifesto was published in 2003. It and its various spinoffs have since sold close to 20 million copies.,But Dr. Agatston still spends much of his time as a working cardiologist. After the first book came out, he opened a private practice where he treats everyone from locals who knew him when he was just another doctor to wealthy South Americans who fly in to see the famous South Beach doctor.,The practice has  2,800 patients, and, as best as Dr. Agatston can recall, only three of them had a heart attack last year. â€œHeart attacks are essentially disappearing from my practice,â€ù he says in his Long Island-tinged accent.,It is a fairly stunning claim, the sort of claim that you might expect to hear from someone who knows how to sell a product. If Dr. Agatston were to do a thorough review of his files, I wonder if he might come across a few more heart attacks, perhaps among patients  he doesnâ€™t see regularly.,But his larger point is a perfectly good one: we now know an enormous amount about how to prevent heart attacks, with powerful drugs like statins, , cessation, exercise and diet.  With the right preventive care, people can cut their risk of a heart attack by up to 80 percent, cardiologists estimate.,â€œWe have made major improvements in prevention,â€ù ,, the director of cardiovascular research at Columbia University, says. â€œBut itâ€™s difficult. It takes frequent visits, a close relationship between a physician and a patient and a very committed patient.â€ù,Which is exactly the atmosphere Dr. Agatstonâ€™s practice tries to create. Nurses there  give patients specific , goals to meet and help them deal with the side effects of the drugs they are taking. A nutritionist, Marie Almon, meets with patients frequently enough to discuss real-life issues like how to stick to a high-fiber Mediterranean diet even on a cruise or a business trip.,There is only one problem with this shining example of a medical practice: it is losing money.,See, preventive medicine just doesnâ€™t pay in the current American medical system. â€œThe time we spend with patients â€” we get rewarded almost zilch,â€ù Dr. Agatston says. Or as ,, a former president of the American Heart Association, puts it: â€œThere is no incentive at all. Itâ€™s a disaster.â€ù,This is obviously an exciting time for health care reform. In California and Massachusetts, state officials have announced plans to provide universal health insurance. Last week, the head of the Business Roundtable, a major corporate lobbying group, and Andy Stern, a  union leader, held a , ,to call for universal coverage.  President Bush devoted a big part of last nightâ€™s State of the Union address to his own health insurance ideas. The push to reduce the number of uninsured, now approaching 50 million, is long overdue.,But a lack of insurance is only one of the two huge problems with health care. The other is the perverse system of incentives that nudges doctors and patients toward expensive tests and procedures when cheaper preventive measures  might actually produce better results. Partly as a result, costs are rising rapidly for the 250 million people who do have insurance.,In cardiac care, nuclear scans and invasive procedures like bypass surgery bring in the money. Medicare alone paid almost $15 billion, or about 5 percent of its total budget, for bypasses, , and other invasive cardiology , of  Dartmouth. Yet for many patients, there is , that stents or surgery  prolong life.,Dr. Agatston doesnâ€™t need Medicare reimbursements to make a living. His books, the latest being â€œThe South Beach Heart Program,â€ù have given him â€œan outside income,â€ù as he delicately puts it. â€œI can afford to be holier than thou,â€ù he says.,Absent a wealthy patron,  many other clinics that focus on preventing , are struggling to survive, Dr. Richard Pasternak, a Harvard Medical School cardiologist and Merck & Company executive, says. Family doctors, doctors who treat back pain and doctors who treat , all face similar challenges.,Itâ€™s important to note that the economic gains from preventive care are sometimes exaggerated. Sadly, the cheapest patients are often the ones who receive no care whatsoever, because many die before they reach their medically expensive golden years.,But the political case  â€”  the moral case  â€”  for prevention is unassailable. And to the extent that drugs and lifestyle changes replace surgery, rather than merely supplement it, preventive care can help pay for itself.,Given the way the  universal insurance movement has taken off, the most likely path to reform probably runs through local governments or other pilot programs, and some of this is beginning to happen.,Humana, the insurer, and Dr. Fuster will soon begin studying 6,000 high-risk patients, in part to get a better understanding of how they can be persuaded to take the preventive steps they should be taking. Medicare, meanwhile, is experimenting with some pay-for-performance stipends for doctors.,â€œWe still pay more when patients have more complications and get more services than when they get better results,â€ù ,, Medicareâ€™s former director, told me recently.,The prevention push is still waiting for its Massachusetts moment â€”  a signature event  to make it a topic of national conversation, as Massachusettsâ€™s health insurance plan did for universal coverage last year. Dr. Agatston, who does have a track record of getting peopleâ€™s attention, has one idea.,â€œMy dream has been to go to a corporation and say, â€˜Have all your executives and all your high-risk employees come to our practice, and if they hit our goals and still have a heart attack, weâ€™ll give you a million dollars,â€™ â€ù Dr. Agatston said. â€œMy wife and our lawyers say, â€˜You canâ€™t do that!â€™ But thatâ€™s frankly my dream.â€ù,Any takers?",DAVID LEONHARDT,"JAN. 24, 2007",Whatâ€™s a Pound of Prevention Really Worth?,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/business/24leonhardt.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œDutchman,â€ù the poet ,â€™s controversial 1964 race play, has always seemed an unwieldy and ineffective boxing glove jabbing at the malignancies of American capitalism, the kind of artless art James Baldwin had in mind 15 years earlier when he derisively coined the phrase â€œprotest fictionâ€ù in The Partisan Review. The white person who goes to see this is supposed to leave feeling like a viper sent off to repent; the middle class African-American is meant to go home regarding any embrace of prosperity as weak, self-negating and lethal,  both politically and spiritually.,â€œDutchmanâ€ù possesses a single objective: to produce guilt. But 43 years after it made its debut at the Cherry Lane Theater â€” where it is currently in revival â€” it fails  to do even that.,Mr. Baraka, who was still LeRoi Jones when he conceived the play, wrote it while in thrall to black separatism, and it remains that movementâ€™s singular cultural emblem. A few months before â€œDutchmanâ€ù was produced, Malcolm X had delivered his famous speech  â€œGodâ€™s Judgment of White Americaâ€ù (more commonly known as â€œThe Chickens Come Home to Roostâ€ù), in which he derided the work of civil rights leaders and warned that the white majority would suffer disastrous consequences, rained down  from the heavens, if it did not atone for the crimes of slavery.,White America, in his speech, is a â€œshe.â€ù And so it is in â€œDutchman,â€ù which compares racism and the ills of the consumerist mindset to a sexually avaricious woman. The entire tense, compact play takes place inside a subway car where an exchange between a flamboyantly loose blonde of about 30, Lula (Jennifer Mudge), and a conservatively dressed young black man, Clay (,), escalates from surreally unsuppressed flirtation to violence and tragedy as all of Clayâ€™s efforts toward assimilation are shown to be for naught.,Lula is all unmitigated repugnance and crude desire. She believes that she can have whatever is before her, and so her prejudicial attitudes become  part of a broader problem. At one point in the angry tirade that consumes half the play, Clay tells her, â€œyou donâ€™t understand anything but luxury,â€ù and this is in some sense the most damning indictment he makes. He is saying, in effect, that Lula, no matter how ignorant and lewd, is luxury, a fair white woman, the cultureâ€™s most desired possession. She is both buyer and bad goods â€” the whole ugly cycle of the free market in one revealing black dress.,What emerging feminists in the audience must have made of all this four decades ago is something to wonder. The notion that a woman might embody all the power and evil of American empire when she still could not make her way out of the broom closet must have had the vague semblance of science fiction.,Aggravating the trouble in the current production is that the director, Bill Duke, has sought to make Lula more than an oversize metaphor. But no matter how noble the effort, it is impossible to draw gold from an empty cauldron. It is one of the playâ€™s few dramatic virtues that it makes Lulaâ€™s manipulation and cruelty immediately apparent.,Under Mr. Dukeâ€™s direction, she arrives onstage as if from a screwball comedy. He seems desperate to give her some kind of dimension but doesnâ€™t quite know what to do, so he has her wiggling and writhing, playing with her sunglasses and making a big, kooky mess. The audience is meant to leave the theater thinking that she is Charles Manson but starts out by likening her to Mae West. In the end, Lula is simply a character you will soon forget.",GINIA BELLAFANTE,"JAN. 24, 2007",â€™60s Prejudice and Capitalism as a Big Blond Metaphor,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/theater/reviews/24dutc.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a move that is expected to jump-start rebuilding along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, State Farm Insurance said yesterday that it had reached an agreement  with state officials to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to owners of homes along the coast that were wrecked by Hurricane Katrina.,The agreement settles lawsuits filed by 640 homeowners and allows thousands of others to reopen damage claims that State Farm previously closed. Insurance executives said they expected the outlines of the deal to be adopted by other carriers.,The agreement does not apply to New Orleans, where the failure of the levees left much of the city underwater for days. Lawyers and insurers say no similar settlement talks are in progress there.,For State Farm, the nationâ€™s largest home insurer and the biggest in Mississippi, the settlement allows for â€œa just, speedy and efficient resolution,â€ù as a spokesman, Phil Supple, put it.,It would also remove a major public relations headache. While State Farm and the other insurers may have had some strong legal arguments, they have been widely perceived as insensitive. In many cases, residents whose houses were reduced to concrete slab foundations received just a few thousand dollars in  payments. Some received nothing.,Under the settlement, 300 homeowners who lost everything will receive their full insurance coverage. Mississippi officials said 1,000 others would receive at least half, with the opportunity to negotiate for more.,â€œA lot of people on the coast are going to see money in their pockets sooner, rather than have to go through a long, drawn-out process of court proceedings,â€ù Mississippiâ€™s insurance commissioner, George Dale, said yesterday.,The core of the dispute was whether the damage to the houses was  caused by high winds or surging floodwaters as Hurricane Katrina swept across the coast on Aug. 29, 2005. The insurers said their policies  covered only wind damage. But in many cases, they also refused to pay for damage caused by a combination of wind and water.,The settlement does not affect the terms of coverage in the insurersâ€™ policies, but some insurance experts said they expected that the carriers would ultimately rewrite their policies to specifically bar coverage of damage from storm surges.,In the settlement talks, which began last fall, State Farm insisted that the Mississippi attorney general, Jim Hood, drop a criminal investigation of the companyâ€™s handling of storm damage claims. It also demanded that he abandon a civil suit against it and other insurers.,The final sticking point in the agreement had been over the framing of a few sentences that would end the criminal investigation. Mr. Hood  convened a grand jury last week that began hearing evidence.,The two sides reached agreement in a meeting yesterday afternoon in Jackson, the state capital. Then lawyers for State Farm and Richard F. Scruggs, who represents hundreds of storm victims and played a major role in drafting the settlement, flew to Gulfport on the coast, to seek the endorsement  of  Judge L. T. Senter Jr., the federal district judge overseeing most of the insurance disputes.,Judge Senter had suggested that he would like to see a global settlement, and some participants in the talks said the first money could begin to flow to storm victims as early as next week.,Under the agreement, State Farm will  pay an initial $130 million and perhaps several hundred million more by the end of the year, depending on how many policyholders requested that their claims be reopened. About 35,000 homeowners along Mississippiâ€™s 70-mile-long coast are eligible.  Among the homeowners who will benefit from the settlement are Senator Trent Lott and Representative Gene Taylor, both of whom lost their homes in the storm and were denied payment by State Farm.,Since Hurricane Katrina struck, the insurance companies have paid $5.3 billion for damage to more than 330,000 homes in Mississippi and $10.3 billion for nearly a million homes in Louisiana.,They have raised rates sharply because, they say, the risk of severe storms has increased. They have also refused to renew many policies in vulnerable areas. The settlement disclosed yesterday is expected to have minimum effect on the cost of coverage.,State Farm got a vivid picture of the hostility toward it in the first jury trial a little more than a week ago. Judge Senter abruptly declared that State Farm had failed to prove its case and the jury quickly came back with a decision requiring  the company to pay $2.5 million in punitive damages to a couple in Biloxi who lost everything in the storm. The judge also awarded the couple the full value of their insurance policy:  $223,000. State Farm had maintained that it owed them nothing.,Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer at White & Williams in Philadelphia who represents insurance companies, said yesterday that it was clear that the bad publicity had been a big factor in State Farmâ€™s decision to settle. â€œThey spent 80 years building up a brand,â€ù he said, â€œand the adverse publicity from these lawsuits has been clearly doing damage to the brand. It just flies in the face of their portrayal of themselves as good neighbors.â€ù,Indeed, according to people close to the talks, it was State Farm that first suggested a settlement in a telephone call early last fall to Mr. Scruggs, the lawyer.,Mr. Scruggs, who came to prominence by filing lawsuits against the tobacco industry, reached an agreement in principle with State Farm two weeks ago.,But Mr. Hood,  the state attorney general, and Mr.  Dale, the  insurance commissioner, expressed reservations. Both officials said they wanted to make sure that homeowners got the best possible deal. Mr. Dale, though, said it was also important that any agreement not be overly burdensome for the insurance companies.,Mr. Scruggs, whose home in Pascagoula was destroyed along with those of many neighbors, said that resolving the coverage dispute had been â€œthe most personal and most difficultâ€ù work in his 30-year career. He has not settled with his own insurer. But for his work on the settlement, he will share as much as $46 million with lawyers from half a dozen firms  â€” to be paid by State Farm on top of its payments to homeowners.,In the agreement, State Farm said it would pay $80 million to settle the 640 lawsuits  and to reopen, at the request of homeowners, up to 35,000 other claims. The insurance company agreed to pay at least $50 million more on the previously closed claims.,Participants in the talks estimated that State Farm could pay a further $250 million to $600 million, depending on how many people reopened claims. For the 300 homes that were swept away, State Farm agreed to pay the full insured value.  Those homes were insured for  $69,700 to $2.34 million. The owners of the 340 other homes, with varying degrees of damage, are to receive an average of $124,400.,In the review of closed claims, homeowners may accept a new offer from State Farm or insist on binding arbitration in hopes of receiving more money. Storm victims are also free to ignore the settlement  and file separate lawsuits against State Farm. But few are expected to do so.",JOSEPH B.

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 â€” President Bush tried to resuscitate his ailing presidency Tuesday night, using his State of the Union address to present a modest agenda of energy and health care proposals while warning an increasingly assertive Congress against undercutting his new , strategy.,It was a speech that reflected Mr. Bushâ€™s difficult circumstances. It was limited in ambition and political punch at home, with no proposals to rival his call two years ago to remake Social Security, no mention of rebuilding New Orleans and no allusions to limiting stem cell research or banning gay marriage.,And when it came to his plan to send additional troops to Iraq, he was forced to plead with the Democrats who now control Congress â€” and with a growing number of Republican critics â€” to â€œgive it a chance to work.â€ù,In an admission that the United States now finds itself trapped in the cross-fire of a sectarian conflict, Mr. Bush said, â€œThis is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we are in.â€ù While he insisted that America could not afford to fail, he also warned the Iraqi government that â€œour commitment is not open-ended.â€ù,His freshest initiative was setting a goal of reducing projected gasoline consumption 20 percent over the next 10 years. This hit a theme tailored to his appeal for bipartisanship in a city where the balance of power has shifted markedly against Mr. Bush since the last State of the Union address. Although he did not propose any measures to deal with emissions from power plants and factories, the main sources of greenhouse gases, he spoke of â€œthe serious challenge of global ,.â€ù,The other main element of his domestic agenda, a package of proposals intended to improve access to health insurance, had drawn intense opposition from Democrats long before Mr. Bush walked to the well of the House chamber on Tuesday night, a scene he could not have relished but handled graciously. Behind him sat a Democratic House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, sitting alongside Vice President Dick Cheney. In front of him was an audience of Democrats growing increasingly comfortable with their new power, including quite a few who are jockeying to take his job and reverse the policies he has put in place.,Mr. Bush gamely ticked off other goals he would like to achieve before leaving office in three days short of two years. They included overhauling , laws, taking steps toward a balanced budget, dealing with the long-term financial condition of Social Security and Medicare, and imposing tighter standards on schools.,Yet the proposals were overwhelmed by the Iraq debate.,â€œMany in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq,â€ù Mr. Bush said, â€œbecause you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching.â€ù,While Mr. Bush has traditionally used these speeches to present a hopeful vision of Iraqâ€™s future, he could not do so on Tuesday night. His own nominee to take over the command of United States forces in Iraq, Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier in the day that â€œthe situation in Iraq is dire.â€ù,Mr. Bush started his speech 12 hours before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was to begin working on a bipartisan resolution in opposition to his plan to send additional troops to Iraq. Despite his proposal of a bipartisan council to advise him on the battle against Islamic extremism, Democrats immediately assailed him, and members of his own party continued to show signs of edging away.,In the Democratic response to his address, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, whose son is a marine serving in Iraq, said that Mr. Bush â€œtook us into this war recklessly,â€ù and that the United States was now â€œheld hostage to the predictable and predicted disarray that followed.â€ù Mr. Webb called for â€œa formula that will in short order allow our combat forces to leave Iraq,â€ù and said that if Mr. Bush did not change course in Iraq and in his economic policies, â€œwe will be showing him the way.â€ù,Mr. Bush got a polite reception, but one far more muted than in previous appearances. He waited until the end of his nearly 50-minute speech to deliver the assessment that typically opens these addresses, that â€œthe state of our union is strong.â€ù For a man who finds himself struggling to maintain public and political support, Mr. Bush delivered the speech in a confident tone, with easy and relaxed smiles.,Seeking new ground for consensus, Mr. Bush reached back to a theme that marked the first days of his presidency, when he would regularly appeal for bipartisanship. â€œOur citizens donâ€™t much care which side of the aisle we sit on, as long as we are willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done,â€ù he said.,But the power dynamic on Tuesday night was completely different. In the six years in which Republicans controlled one or both houses of Congress, Democrats said they saw little of that bipartisan instinct at work, and despite vows to behave differently, they have not shown much in return.,In fact, Mr. Bushâ€™s argument on Tuesday night for embracing his Iraq plan amounted to a reverse of the argument that he made from the same podium four years ago, when he contended that dealing with Saddam Hussein would help the United States bring other rogue states to heel. This time, Mr. Bush spoke of a â€œnightmare scenario,â€ù of an Iraq â€œoverrun by extremists on all sides.â€ù He said the violence in the country would turn contagious, spread beyond Iraqâ€™s borders and inflame the entire Middle East.,And he appealed to Democrats to remember the votes many of them cast in 2002 to authorize the invasion, throwing some responsibility their way in the process.,â€œWe went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions,â€ù he said, recalling the days when his approval ratings were sky-high. â€œAnd whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure.â€ù,Mr. Bush was careful in describing what many in his administration believe could be a coming confrontation with Iran. While he vowed that the world would never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, he made no threats, saying he was relying on diplomacy to deal with both Iran and North Korea, the two countries that, five years ago, he declared in a State of the Union address made up an â€œaxis of evilâ€ù with Mr.  Husseinâ€™s Iraq.,There were no such labels on Tuesday, a reflection of the reality that with American forces tied down in Iraq, Mr. Bushâ€™s options are limited.,But the effect of Iraq extends to the domestic front. Even his allies say the war threatens the prospects of the new initiatives he described.,â€œIraq casts a huge shadow over anything in the domestic policy arena that the president talks about,â€ù said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. â€œThe situation makes it very difficult for the president to get Americans to pay attention to what heâ€™s saying on issues like energy and health care.â€ù,Dan Bartlett, the White House counselor, argued otherwise. â€œIf you talk about the issues the public cares about, and you put forward innovative, bold ideas,â€ù Mr. Bartlett said, â€œthe American people, regardless of what the polls say that day, will say, â€˜This is worth study, this is worth engaging the Democratic Congress on.â€™ â€ù,Ms. Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, said in a joint statement that Mr. Bushâ€™s goals on energy were â€œcommendableâ€ù but suggested that they would seek to achieve them through different policies.,Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, speaking on ABC News, said Mr. Bush would find â€œa receptive audienceâ€ù for his energy and health care goals, though she later said she found the early details of his health care plan â€œreally troubling.â€ù The Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the two parties should find innovative ways to tackle the issues.,Mr. Bushâ€™s aides and allies argue that he could exert some leverage by accusing Democrats of intransigence and â€œdo-nothingnessâ€ù should they flatly shoot down his proposals, as they were starting to do even before his speech.,â€œThe real question is not whether he can make it work; heâ€™s extended his hand several times now,â€ù said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. â€œThe real question is how much do the Democrats want to cooperate with him.â€ù,But the Democrats have been in control only a few weeks, and polls indicate that for now the public is more likely to side with them in a fight. And it is not clear that Mr. Bushâ€™s new proposals would do anything to reverse the political balance of power.","DAVID E.

"Just as Web listings transformed international real estate a decade ago, new Internet tools are making even more information available â€” and not just from real estate agents.,Increasing numbers of potential buyers and investors are exchanging information in online forums, downloading video and audio reports and reading blogs for property news and opinion.,Web activity by international real estate professionals and laymen started picking up only last year. Sam Taliaferro, an American developer in Panama, now spends three hours a day on a half-dozen blogs that range from events in his development to general investment trends and life in the country.,â€œI am reading anyway, and it only takes a few minutes to add commentary and post,â€ù he said.,Mr. Taliaferro is working with the National Association of Realtors in North America and with Overseas Property Professionals in Europe to expand his marketing and blogging activities throughout Central America and Mexico in the coming year.,Kunle Campbell started blogging from Oxford, England, almost two years ago while researching his masterâ€™s thesis at Warwick University.,Mr. Campbellâ€™s study â€” carrying out an online marketing strategy for Property Frontiers, an international real estate consultancy â€” led him to set up an international property blog, ,, a kind of news diary, to help himself understand market dynamics.,After graduating from Oxford, he began a more specialized blog â€” , .,â€œI was priced out of the U.K. and looking for a Bulgarian ski apartment as a first step on the property ladder, and also as an investment vehicle to jump-start my entry into the U.K. property market,â€ù said Mr. Campbell, 26, who was born in Nigeria.,He found a place, but then decided it was not a good investment. Now he is looking for a leaseback arrangement in France or an apartment in Berlin, but he remains bullish on Bulgarian real estate.,His blogs only recently started earning money, what he describes as â€œa pittanceâ€ù from Google advertising, but he is redesigning them this month to make room for banner advertising. He also plans to include commentary from a real estate researcher.,Podcasting, a format that has skyrocketed in the past couple of years thanks to the popularity of Appleâ€™s iPod, also are proving popular for information related to real estate.,â€œPodcasts are a huge medium at the moment for many media consumers who like to digest their information in other ways than reading,â€ù said Felicity Quigley, property editor at Buy Association, ,. The site was started in September as â€œan impartial buying guide,â€ù with fact sheets, articles and surveys as well as podcasts.,â€œA podcast, being audio, is quite personal. You can do other things on our site whilst listening or take it away to listen at your convenience,â€ù said Ms. Quigley, an Australian journalist who ventured into international real estate herself six years ago, buying and reselling a , condo to pay for her wedding.,â€œItâ€™s about gaining your information the way you want it, when you want it, all to suit your needs, rather than the needs of the media provider,â€ù she said.,Podcast topics range from Cyprus to South Africa and run for 30 to 45 minutes.,The host is Adrian Mills, a British broadcaster who owns property in Thailand and Dubai. He interviews international property experts, often agents or developers, but Ms. Quigley said topics are based on consumer demand rather than plugging advertisers.,The audio programs also are syndicated in an online network that includes ,, ,, , and ,.,Ms. Quigley said the site plans to add forums, blogs, competitions and polls in the next few months; video will be added during the summer.,Video has started appearing on some real estate Web sites, offering virtual walk-throughs, but many people around the world are excluded from making or from playing such videos by a lack of technical resources and English proficiency, according to Tony Grey, a former Microsoft group manager.,For some months now, he has been developing software to make narrated videos available in several languages and to expand a multilingual Web site called ,, which he bills as a â€œnew real estate approach.â€ù,â€œWe are building a Web engine that can create personalized user experiences in multiple languages across dozens or hundreds of Web sites,â€ù he said on a blog associated with the site.,The number of videos narrated in English, Portuguese and Spanish on For Sale by Locals has been increasing steadily since the Beta version of the site was started  in October.,The downloadable videos often have a home-video quality to them, but the accompanying commentary lets visitors know about the neighborhoods, whether a house roof can support a second floor, what amenities are included and agent contact information. Few of the residential properties on the site cost more than $100,000 and some are priced as low as $20,000.,To date, most of the featured properties are in Bolivia, where Mr. Grey owns property, but the site is to expand to Costa Rica this month. Anyone  can post interviews and narrated videos on the site, which does not charge for video titles, digitalization and conversion to Internet format.,â€œWeâ€™re not trying to be agents,â€ù Mr. Grey said in a telephone interview. â€œItâ€™s really about building community.â€ù",NANCY BETH JACKSON,"JAN. 24, 2007",Blogging for Property Sales,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/realestate/greathomes/24gh-internet.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A motorist who shot at another car on the Pennsylvania Turnpike was sentenced to prison Monday and ordered to pay the toll and fees charged to the victim when he fled through an automated toll lane without paying. The gunman, Paul J. Voulo, was given a sentence of 14 months to four years in state prison and required to pay $59 in toll charges for the victim, Benjamin P. Kraynak. â€œI would have driven through it, too,â€ù said the judge, David W. Addy. Mr. Kraynak drove through an E-ZPass electronic toll booth without an E-ZPass account. He said he had tried to explain the situation to turnpike officials. â€œI spoke to them numerous times, and they said it would go to collections,â€ù Mr. Kraynak said. A turnpike spokesman, Carl DeFebo, said the agency would have waived the administrative fees added to the toll had it known about the crime.",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"JAN. 24, 2007",Pennsylvania: Motorist Sentenced in Shooting,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/us/24brfs-ez.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Imagine all the decadence, incoherence and insanity of Times Square jammed into a black-box theater and you get some sense of what youâ€™re in for with Big Art Groupâ€™s â€œDead Set #3,â€ù at the Kitchen as part of the Under the Radar festival.,Scenes of war and destruction shoot across video screens and are re-enacted by seven performers (some looking game, others awkward) who are sometimes naked and other times wearing glittery hoods, an absurd style that manages to locate the intersection between Abu Ghraib and Las Vegas. Themes of apocalypse and trauma echo throughout this flashy and shallow entry in the ever-expanding genre of high-tech theater.,Caden Manson, the director, melds a love of pop-culture detritus with an aesthetic that punishes its audience with an orgy of spectacle. The fractured script is a mix of dialogue snippets from movies like â€œFull Metal Jacket,â€ù borrowed online chats and obscure sources.,The actors videotape themselves onstage, and their images are edited and projected live onto four screens. The show, which can be an adrenaline rush, is best appreciated as a sort of overblown music video with stark lighting, billowing smoke and headache-inducing sound designs.,Repeated images of murder, war and cannibalism come and go faster than you have time to process them. Itâ€™s a soulless production, which may be the point.,Live theater itself seems under assault as the actors are dwarfed by the swirling technology around them. Eventually they are even pushed offstage by a giant, ballooning bubble, a showstopping effect (in two senses) that grows and grows until there is no choice but to end the play â€” with no curtain call.,But the most disturbing scene may be earlier, when the cast members strip down to skin-hugging black leather suits that cover their entire heads, making them resemble sadomasochistic superheroes. (You have to see it to believe it.),The actors look vaguely ridiculous in these get-ups, but move your eyes to the screens, and the dark lighting, tight close-ups and crooked, jaunty angles are positively frightening.

"BROWN is not exactly the color of excitement. To achieve a hint of glamour, brown must adopt more seductive aliases, like chestnut, cocoa or cafe au lait. Unaltered, brown might as well be plain vanilla, the blah-est of moods, the Charlie Brownest of the ordinary. â€œBrown shoes donâ€™t make it,â€ù Frank Zappa sang in a more cutting assessment of this most defenseless of colors.,So how is one to talk up what the British for centuries have so doggedly called brown ale, except when they were using the alternate, equally soporific mild ale? The Germans havenâ€™t done much better. Their own version of brown ale, long the signature beer of the DÃ_sseldorf region in northwestern Germany, is called altbier, literally old beer.,Ever creative and unbeholden to tradition, American craft brewers have made the brown-ale style their own. The name, alas, remains brown.,Perhaps itâ€™s left to us, the Dining sectionâ€™s tasting panel, to rescue brown ales from marketing torpidity and reveal the vitality within, for these beers are anything but dull. Yes, they are quiet, subtle and even self-effacing. More important, they are delicious, and they especially shine with food. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two guests, Richard Scholz, an owner of Bierkraft in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and Lew Bryson, a beer writer and managing editor of Malt Advocate magazine.,As with great character actors who are so easy to take for granted, you have to pay close attention to brown ales to appreciate their virtue. They have roles to play â€” quenching thirst, facilitating conversation, sharpening the appetite â€” and they do it well. If by chance you notice the fine, almost sweet maltiness of the aroma, and the brisk, dry, mineral quality of the flavors, even better. More likely, itâ€™s the absence of these qualities in a poor example that stands out, conveying the sense of something missing.,Brown ales come in more than one flavor. The British offer two styles, the crisper northern brown ale and the softer, sweeter southern ale. German altbiers tend to be earthier and fruitier, with a refreshingly bitter aftertaste. And the American brown ales; well, if it is possible to turn up the volume on this sedate style, American craft brewers will find a way, often by adding the citrus and pine aromas of American hops.,The result is a stylistic hodgepodge of beers bound primarily by their color, and even that is a stretch. For while all the beers were indeed brown, they represented every shade of brown, from copper, tawny and brick to mahogany bordering on black.,â€œItâ€™s such a stylistic spectrum,â€ù Mr. Scholz said, â€œthat you have to evaluate them by asking what is good to drink.â€ù,By that criterion, the very best was Ellieâ€™s Brown Ale from the Avery Brewing Company in Boulder, Colo., which had such a beautiful malt aroma that sniffing it seemed like pleasure enough. But drinking it was awfully good, too, with its interwoven flavors of smoke, fruit and minerals.,Our No. 2 beer, Goose Island Nut Brown Ale from Chicago, had a roasted malt aroma and flavors that were elegant, deep and balanced. Like the best of these ales, it made you want to keep drinking it, not much of a problem since the alcohol levels generally hover around a low 5 percent.,Goose Island was one of three beers with the enticing moniker Nut Brown, fittingly evocative of old England as it was derived from Samuel Smithâ€™s Nut Brown Ale, a classic of the northern English style. Smithâ€™s, a no-nonsense brew, has long been one of my favorites, offering earthy, dry flavors and a refreshing balance between malts and hops.,While our top two beers were both American, our No. 3, the Long Trail Double Bag Ale from Vermont, was the first to epitomize a distinctly American style, with aromas from American hops. Should you wonder about the origin of the name Double Bag, the labelâ€™s image of a well-endowed cow will resolve the issue.,Domestic beers dominated our selection, with 18 American brown ales against four from Germany, two from England and one from the Netherlands, and they accounted for eight of our top 10 brews.,The lone German beer among our favorites was the Uerige Sticke Alt, which is a slightly hoppier version of the traditional altbier that Uerige makes several times a year. Unlike some of the other imports, this beer was extremely fresh and deliciously lively. Incidentally, while altbier means old beer, what it really connotes is beer made in the old style, an indication that even as most German brewers converted to lager beers in the 19th century, those in the DÃ_sseldorf area clung to their ale-making ways.,While altbiers have remained popular in Germany, brown ales have become less so in Britain, which may be why we could find only two. In his 2003 book, â€œThe Brewmasterâ€™s Table,â€ù Garrett Oliver of the Brooklyn Brewery suggests that mild brown ales, the knock-back drink of thirsty coal miners and dock workers, are not so appealing to post-industrial office workers, who are less thirsty and more aspirational.,Nonetheless, they seem highly popular among Americans who are unburdened by the coal-encrusted history of brown ale. Brews from the Ithaca Beer Company, Brooklyn Brewery and Smuttynose were all superb in their own way, with Ithaca and Brooklyn following the quieter British style and Smuttynose going all-out hoppy American.,While we had room for only 10 top beers, we liked many more as well. Do not sneer at brown ales like the chocolate-inflected Dogfish Head, the creamy Samuel Adams, the fruity Alaskan, the sweetly malty Newcastle from Britain or the hoppy Southampton, whose Secret Ale was inspired by the Uerige Sticke Alt.,And donâ€™t forget the Netherlands brown ale either, although it is easy to miss. It comes from Grolsch, better known for its lager beer in a distinctive swing-top bottle. The brown ale, fittingly, comes with a plain old bottle cap. Itâ€™s fruity and refreshing, more altbier than British brown. And perhaps because itâ€™s adapting another countryâ€™s beer heritage, Grolsch felt free to take a marketing liberty. This brown is labeled amber ale.,Brisk, with rich malt aromas. Fruit, mineral and bitter hop flavors.,Aroma of chocolate and malt; clean with good depth of flavor.,Inviting, malty and refreshing, with aromas of sweet fruit and piney hops.,Strong malty aroma, with dry, brisk flavors that linger.,(Importer: Merchant du Vin, Tukwila, Wash.),Very fresh, with aromas of chocolate and malt, and bitter, lingering flavors.,(B. United International, Redding, Conn.),Pale brown with a pleasing oatlike, nutty aroma; distinct and refreshing.,British style, with roasted malt aroma and minerals and nutlike flavors.,Dominated by piney American hop aromas, yet pleasing and refreshing.,Well balanced with herbal and fruit aromas, and lingering, bitter flavors.,Piney hop aromas with dry malt and herbal flavors.,Ratings range from zero to four stars and reflect the panelâ€™s reaction to ales, which were tasted with names concealed. The panelists this week are Eric Asimov; Florence Fabricant; Richard Scholz, an owner of Bierkraft in Park Slope, Brooklyn; and Lew Bryson, a beer writer and managing editor of Malt Advocate magazine.,The tasted ales represent a selection generally available in supermarkets, beer distributorships and over the Internet.

"Forget about false modesty, not to mention its nonfalse counterpart. , came to Madison Square Garden on Monday night to celebrate his favorite singer, his favorite actor, his favorite comedian, his favorite sex symbol and his favorite storyteller, who all  happen to share his name. Near the end, Mr. Foxx morphed into , â€” only to thank himself for doing such a good job playing himself in â€œRay.â€ù,As you can tell, one of Mr. Foxxâ€™s greatest assets is his shamelessness. And he needed every bit to make it through this night â€” billed as an evening of music and comedy â€” more or less unscathed. He faced a big (though not quite full) crowd, armed with only a pretty good voice and a handful of rather thin, slow jams. A performerâ€™s nightmare, you might think, but not for Mr. Foxx, and his good humor was contagious. Itâ€™s hard to stay mad at a one-track-minded crooner who announces his intention to ignore half the crowd: â€œFellas, you can stick around if you want to.â€ù,He had some help: the â€œAmerican Idolâ€ù winner Fantasia delivered a short, fierce set of screaming R&B, and the stand-up comedian known as Speedy did a familiar but effective routine, gleefully roasting audience members who had good seats and bad timing.,But this was essentially a one-man show, and it started with a nod to the past. Before he was a crooner or â€œa Oscar winnerâ€ù (as he often referred to himself), Mr. Foxx was a comedian. So he spent his first half-hour telling stories and ridiculing celebrities, including O. J. Simpson (it was gruesome) and Britney Spears (even more gruesome). Like most successful comedians, Mr. Foxx knows that the delivery is usually more important than the material. Recalling the R&B group Jodeci, he said, â€œThat was back when it was a cassetteâ€ù; thatâ€™s not really a joke, but he hit that last word so hard that the audience chuckled anyway.,Mr. Foxx released a little-noticed record in 1994, but his chart-topping 2005 album, â€œUnpredictableâ€ù (J Records/Sony BMG), felt like a debut. He has clearly been influenced by R. Kelly, who excels at turning ridiculous boasts and promises (â€œYou remind me of my jeep/I wanna ride itâ€ù) into glorious R&B songs. Of course, Mr. Kelly has two things that Mr. Foxx lacks: a gorgeous voice and a first-rate catalog of hits.,If ever there was a show crying out for more guest stars, this was it. You can imagine Mr. Foxx as the leader of an old-fashioned variety show: bringing out some friends, singing a few songs, doing some skits and parodies. Instead he began with a lackluster version of the albumâ€™s hit title track (Ludacris, who contributes a great verse to the album version, was sorely missed), then spent much of the rest of the night killing time. This is a guy who can get women to scream just by crooning Zodiac signs â€” and at one point, he did exactly that.,Still, there is something satisfying about watching Mr. Foxx bask in his well-deserved success. And, for that matter, his less-well-deserved success too. â€œLove Changes,â€ù his duet with Mary J.

"On the night of Jan. 21, 1998,  Stanley N. Alpert was heading home in Greenwich Village with pleasant thoughts on his mind. The next day he would turn 38. By chance, he had struck up a conversation with an attractive woman on the subway, and it looked as if a date were in the cards. As he walked, he mused, and as he mused, he failed to notice two armed men closing in on him from behind. Before he knew it, he was in the back seat of a new Lexus, about to experience the most terrifying 25 hours of his life.,â€œThe Birthday Partyâ€ù is Mr. Alpertâ€™s harrowing, often hilarious reconstruction of what should have been a garden-variety New York street crime. He gives a taut, hour-by-hour account of a simple robbery that became a kidnapping and then, by a quirk of fate, a ghetto version of â€œThe Ransom of Red Chief,â€ù as Mr. Alpert, by all appearances Grade A victim material, turned into a colossal headache for his captors. Precisely how this nebbishy Brooklyn boy, partial to peach-flavored Snapple iced tea and chocolate chip cookies, induced reverse Stockholm syndrome and maneuvered his way to freedom makes â€œThe Birthday Partyâ€ù one of the most exhilarating, improbable New York stories ever told.,The original plan was simple:  drive the victim to an A.T.M. and force him to withdraw money. When Lucky, the gangâ€™s ringleader, discovered that Mr. Alpert had $110,000 in his savings account,  the plan changed. After a quick visit to the A.T.M., Mr. Alpert found himself sitting blindfolded in an apartment somewhere in Brooklyn, watched over by three armed men, three prostitutes employed by Lucky and one very nervous landlord.,In the morning, Lucky informs him, he will be driven to his bank to withdraw $50,000 that Lucky, in a telephone transaction, has shifted from savings to checking. There is nothing to worry about, one captor insists: â€œYou got your fine education, your good job. It donâ€™t matter to you if I get your money. Youâ€™ll just make it again.â€ù,At this point it has not quite dawned on the gang exactly what Mr. Alpert meant when he informed them that he was an assistant federal attorney and that they might have made a small miscalculation in choosing him.,The ordeal of captivity is horrific yet ridiculous, like a demented episode of MTVâ€™s â€œReal World.â€ù Mr. Alpert himself wavers between the two points of view. All around him, a chaotic scene unfolds, as Ren and Sen, the two henchmen, play with their guns, philosophize, smoke marijuana and have sex with the prostitutes. Occasionally Lucky, attending to pressing business concerns in the outside world, pops in to restore order and refine the crime plans.,Mr. Alpert concentrates, very hard, on exuding a cooperative spirit and winning the sympathy of those around him, all the while filing away small bits of information that will help convict everyone in the room if he ever gets out alive.,There are many tense moments. Sen, without warning, begins raving, screaming out sick, violent fantasies of murder and mayhem. â€œI remained frozen in sheer terror, silent and unflinching, hoping he would not act,â€ù Mr. Alpert writes. Gradually,  he realizes that Sen is singing along to a Busta Rhymes rap on the radio.,When the gang offers Mr. Alpert free sex with one of the women, he calculates feverishly. A refusal might be interpreted as racism. On the other hand, the loss of dignity might make him seem less sympathetic, easier to inflict pain on. He says no, very politely.,Mr. Alpert and his captors inhabit different worlds. The men laugh at Mr. Alpertâ€™s $49 Florsheim shoes. They examine his watch and ring with contempt. They cannot understand why, at his age, he is not married with children. Mr. Alpert tells them that his parents wonder the same thing. His money earns him a measure of respect, and, as the hours drag on, Ren and Sen ask for free, much appreciated legal advice.,A bond develops. â€œYo, Stanley, you should join our gang,â€ù Sen tells him. â€œYou could recommend friends that we could kidnap.â€ù After a momentâ€™s reflection, Sen amends his suggestion â€œNaw, I mean you could recommend your , for us to kidnap.â€ù Mr. Alpert decides a cryptic smile is the best response.,Eventually Lucky decides that going into a bank with Mr. Alpert might be a high-risk operation. Further, he has come to realize that he is holding a hot potato. Mr. Alpert is bundled into the Lexus late at night and driven somewhere eerily quiet. With good reason, he suspects that his luck has run out. Rather than spoil one of the bookâ€™s most bleakly funny moments, let me just note that few sounds have quite the sensory impact of duct tape being ripped from a roll.,Mr. Alpert may be no hero, but he survived his kidnapping by remaining extraordinarily cool under pressure, and keeping his lawyerly wits about him. Observant and shrewd, he amassed a dossierâ€™s worth of evidence to present to the police, who were, in fact, deeply impressed by what they heard: they judged his story to be the biggest pack of lies ever bundled together by an unaided human being.,Only after crucial details panned out did the chase begin in earnest. The pursuit and capture of Lucky and the rest of the crew, an operation successfully completed in about 48 hours, make  a rousing conclusion to a crazy adventure.,New Yorkers enjoy playing one-upmanship when it comes to crime. Iâ€™ll see your mugging and raise you two break-ins and a carjacking. Mr. Alpert suffered terribly, but he does have something to show for the experience. For the rest of his life, no one will ever beat him in this little game.",WILLIAM GRIMES,"JAN. 24, 2007",A Hostage Who Stayed a Few Steps Ahead,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/books/24grim.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lonelygirl15 wants a career. Sheâ€™s considering becoming a forest ranger but lacks the stomach for herd-thinning. Teaching aerobics is another option, but sheâ€™s worried sheâ€™s too smart for that.,Lonelygirl15 â€” thatâ€™s Bree (Jessica Lee Rose), the star of the hit online serial that clicks along at , â€” also wants female friends, like, say, Katharine McPhee, the â€œAmerican Idolâ€ù runner-up she met in the low-key but lively episode that made its debut last Friday. That girl seems cool. She has a loud laugh, no manifest cult involvements and a song on the episodeâ€™s soundtrack.,She even dares to  pose a blockbuster question to Bree and her two Webcam-happy boyfriends: â€œDo you guys film everything?â€ù,Yeah, they do. As milowent, a longtime student of the series, observed on a fan site: â€œThe McPhee character ,. She is the audience. She pointed out a lot of ridiculous things about the show.â€ù,Bree has plenty of reasons to take stock of her life right now. Ever since she  fled the luminous bedroom where she started her tantalizing video blog on June 16, 2006, and soon after seeing her authoritarian father murdered on New Yearâ€™s Eve, our lady of YouTube has been stuck in peculiar straits. The â€œLonelygirl15â€ù phenomenon that initially teased viewers with its pseudo-reality has evolved into a vaguely supernatural thriller with hints  of â€œBuffy, the Vampire Slayer.â€ù Itâ€™s inventive, with highs and lows. On balance, itâ€™s entertaining. But devoted fans love to complain that itâ€™s not as good as it used to be, or as it could be.,Bree is now shacked up with Jonas (Jackson Davis), an alpha-dog rich kid who just wants to help her, and Daniel (Yousef Abu-Taleb), a beta-dog penniless kid who just wants to help her. Both seem besotted. She seems freaked out.,And the presence of Ms. McPhee, the anodyne pop star who is said to be the first of several guest stars on the series, has thrown into relief still more dimensions to Breeâ€™s freakiness. Thatâ€™s what makes Ms. McPheeâ€™s episode enlightening. Itâ€™s called â€œTruth or Dare,â€ù and at just under four  minutes, itâ€™s one of the longest in the series.,In the episode Ms. McPhee plays a nameless young woman who is recruited into a night of Texas Hold â€™Em, Truth or Dare and mild debauchery with Breeâ€™s mÃ©nage. She also manages, in her innocence,  to stumble onto some dark details of the plot, including Danielâ€™s careless mention of the Order (the cult that Bree escaped) and the Watcher (a figure from the Order who may be trying to get Bree back).,Ms. McPhee dexterously underplays her character, who in ratty hair and a T-shirt is presented in contrast to Ms. McPheeâ€™s own public dazzle; she looks great. Throaty, game, no-nonsense: something in the bright capability of Ms. McPheeâ€™s character further makes Bree look high-strung, a hothouse flower whose stuffed animals are not cute but creepily regressive.,In this clash of sensibilities too, â€œLonelygirl15,â€ù the series, comes off as twee compared with the boisterous, puppyish â€œAmerican Idol.â€ù (Indeed, what doesnâ€™t?) In the midst of this introvert-extrovert collision, Ms. Rose, who has become a truly terrific actress, chooses to strangle Breeâ€™s confidence and become childish, as when she faces Ms. McPhee for the first time. â€œWho are you?â€ù she asks, sounding threatened, and meek.,If Bree is jealous, the immediate reason is that Ms. McPheeâ€™s character has come home with Daniel, who has gotten drunk at a bowling alley and leaned on this new girl as he stumbled out to Jonasâ€™s car for a ride home. Though it struck some viewers as reckless, the McPhee characterâ€™s willingness to hang out with these guys for the night seemed a typical nothing-better-to-do small town calculation.,But what is coolest about â€œTruth or Dareâ€ù is whatâ€™s been admirable about the series all along: its deep familiarity with and integration of the conventions of online video. â€œTruth or Dare,â€ù like a  majority of the â€œLonelygirl15â€ù installments, has an organic reason for being. It exists, in other words, not just to showcase Katharine McPhee, nor to advance the adolescent farrago. Rather, this episode is a stand-alone drunk-shaming video, one of YouTubeâ€™s many answers to the pillory.,In the drunk-shaming microgenre, videos show people passed out from drinking as theyâ€™re  decorated with Magic Markers, made to urinate or brought to consciousness with fireworks. (For the connoisseur,, offers a nicely sordid collection.) Daniel is slurry or unconscious for the length of â€œTruth or Dare,â€ù and the episode ends with Jonas resolving to do something â€œmeanâ€ù to him. We see the results in the next episode, when Daniel appears with a mustache and beard in ink.,Keeping together a rollicking plot with murder, a cult, imposture and teenage romance â€” making it exciting but not ludicrous â€” isnâ€™t easy. Striving for continuity while relaying plot information in short bytes is an especially tall order. Viewers are standing by on fan sites official and unofficial to play gotcha anytime they decide Bree and company wouldnâ€™t have had enough time while on the lam, say, to make it to an Internet cafe for video editing and uploading between chase scenes. Theyâ€™re a tough crowd. And this policing still goes on, even though fans know the series is fiction.,But in spite of this scrutiny, the team behind â€œLonelygirl15â€ùâ€” by and large, the same team that started the series,  including Ramesh Flinders, Miles Beckett and Greg Goodfried â€” has continued to produce regular videos, maintain an active fan site, spin off a Lonelygirl15 alternative-reality game, line up guest stars and otherwise sustain the momentum they created.,As a serial drama   too, â€œLonelygirl15â€ù has kept its first unbeatable asset, the one that  has nothing to do with new technology. Itâ€™s the girl: Jessica Lee Rose. As the series goes on, Ms. Rose continues to mix moodiness, charm and precociousness, and her witchcraft casts a serious spell. For every fan whoâ€™s mad at her for jerking Daniel around, there are 10 who are newly in love. And the fact that sheâ€™s now out of her parentsâ€™ clutches and in the wide worldâ€”Ã  la Lolita, in motels and guest housesâ€”makes her suddenly more available.,But Lonelygirl15 is formidable. Though gawked at by fans worldwide, she looks back only through the palm-size porthole on our computers. No wonder she now says she wants a life in the latest episode. Her story has always been about a girl looking into a camera, planning an escape. And surely she can dream. One day Lonelygirl15 will shake off these guys, teach some aerobics, get her Ranger badge, grab a gun and thin the thundering herds.",VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN,"JAN. 24, 2007","As Her World Turns, Lonelygirl15 Seeks New Thrills",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/arts/television/24heff.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When books or paintings become too dizzying, you can walk away until youâ€™re ready for more. But performance art keeps coming at you, ready or not. Though audience members can practice some form of pacing, much of the effect depends on the artistâ€™s skill in knowing how much is too much, or when too much is just enough.,In â€œA Page Out of Order: M,â€ù Yoshiko Chuma is constantly rearranging, layering and shifting to reveal another view â€” much like the movable cubes that are a staple of her choreography. Using black-and-white film, text, dance, singing and a marvelous onstage band, for 90 minutes she stirs an uneasy brew of war, identity and dislocation.,The vocalist Sizzle Ohtaka narrates, in Japanese, as text snippets of stories about failed relationships and ethnic strife flash onto screens. Then she sings mournfully over a recording of wind.,The wonderfully astute American dancer Christopher Williams crouches and stretches among the metal cube frames. The musicians dart here and there on their many instruments, evoking Latin jazz and conjuring old movie soundtracks or what sounds like Romanian gypsy music. Images of desolate landscapes come and go.,At moments the results are sophisticated, exhilarating and transformative in ways only half understood but strongly felt. At other times the chaos seems banal, a simple case of clutter; perhaps, you think, Ms. Chuma could play her cards a bit closer to her chest.,But then she is off in another direction, and you follow, ready or not.,â€œI could say we are moving from one system to the other,â€ù the Macedonian dancer Iskra Sukarova explains early on, though she is actually sitting quite still in her chair. â€œIâ€™m moving, too. Iâ€™m not sure that I really like to move so much, though. It kind of makes me sick sometimes.â€ù,Ms. Sukarova, who functions as the performanceâ€™s quiet heart, is referring to her countryâ€™s political situation, both the tedium and upset that come with such upheaval.,But, of course, she is also talking about art, how maddening it can be.

"In 1955, shortly after â€œThe Lord of the Ringsâ€ù was published, J. R. R. Tolkien began to worry his creation had become a â€œvast gameâ€ù for some readers. This was not good, he wrote, even â€œfor me, who find that kind of thing only too fatally attractive.â€ù,Now, Tolkienâ€™s â€œLord of the Ringsâ€ù and the imaginary setting he painstakingly built, Middle-earth, has become that â€œvast game.â€ù,Tomorrow in Las Vegas,  Turbine Inc. of Westwood, Mass., is to  announce an  April 24 release date for The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, the yearâ€™s most anticipated massively multiplayer online game, or M.M.O.  A digital Middle-earth will open its gates to thousands of virtual characters embarking on quests, plumbing subterranean realms and slaughtering plenty of goblins and trolls.,â€œExpectations are fairly high for this game,â€ù said Michael Goodman, digital entertainment program manager for the consumer research division of the Yankee Group, a consulting firm. â€œThis is literally a franchise with a brand that spans the globe. There arenâ€™t a lot of those around.â€ù,Some 200 million copies of â€œThe Lord of the Ringsâ€ù have been published in 39 languages. The 2001-2003 , film trilogy amassed gross revenues of more than $3 billion worldwide.,Yet for the online â€œRingsâ€ù to succeed, Turbine cannot depend on existing gamers alone. It also needs to lure Tolkien devotees who donâ€™t play video games by making it â€œaccessible to just about anyone,â€ù Andrew Park, senior editor at GameSpot, an online gaming news and review site, said in an e-mail interview.,â€œFrom what I gather, Turbine is targeting two different audiences for this game: hard-core online game players,â€ù Mr. Park said, â€œand more-casual or nongame-players who are fans of Tolkienâ€™s works.â€ù,But visualizing hobbit villages and evil armies for Tolkienâ€™s Middle-earth, an already meticulously detailed and plotted world, is complicated. Fans expect its parameters â€” the languages, geographies, histories, races, nomenclature, mythologies and what Tolkien called the legendarium â€” to be strictly obeyed.,â€œBasically, the main challenge of creating an authentic Tolkien experience is building something that wonâ€™t make Tolkienâ€™s many fans angry by straying too far away from the original works,â€ù Mr. Park said. Sticklers for detail will be quick to point out any inconsistencies. Even a characterâ€™s eye color, Mr. Park said, canâ€™t be off, not by a â€œnanometer.â€ù,A further challenge is that immersive M.M.O. worlds must entertain for hours, days, even years of play. They have to be infinitely detailed and vast enough that tens of thousands of players can interact with one  another at the same time.,Since September some 300,000 users have beta-tested the fates of elvish lore masters and hobbit burglars in a 50-million-square-meter Middle-earth still under construction (and giving the game great advance word of mouth). Most players expect  â€œcreative leapsâ€ù to adapt a reading experience into compelling play, said Larry Curtis of ,, a Tolkien fan site.,â€œYouâ€™ve got to have a good game,â€ù he added. â€œItâ€™s not an easy balance.â€ù,Many readers of the novels feared their dumbing-down when the films were first released, Mr. Curtis said. To head off such criticism of the game, Turbine hired â€œRingsâ€ù experts to ensure that any ideas or inventions were consistent with the rules of Middle-earth.,The consultants â€œwould write back with notes on a script: â€˜an elf might not do that,â€™ or, â€˜if youâ€™re looking for a more dwarven name, this might work as a family tree,â€™ â€ù recounted Jeffrey Anderson, Turbineâ€™s chief executive. His team also worked closely with Tolkien Enterprises, which manages â€œRingâ€ù merchandising and film rights, seeking its approval for any major departure from the books.,Turbine created Asheronâ€™s Call, its first online role-playing game, in 1999. Last year, the company released Dungeons & Dragons Online, based on the original pen-and-paper role-playing game. (Loosely based on Tolkienâ€™s milieu, D & D was credited with establishing the fantasy gaming genre.) And this isnâ€™t the first time â€œRingsâ€ù has gone digital: Tolkien-esque computer games â€” some authorized, some not â€” have been around since the early 1980s.,But Turbineâ€™s is the first Tolkien-based M.M.O. Like the immensely popular World of Warcraft, it will allow anyone â€” anyone willing to pay about $50 for the software and a monthly subscription fee of up to $15, that is â€” to not only battle monsters, but also increase virtual skills, wealth and renown. The game makes provisions for the peaceful: Some gamers may be content with their characters weaving and talking (via voice-chat technology), jamming in bands at the local tavern (using an in-game music system) or raising crops and families.,A game this size is bound to  invite some dissent among the dedicated. On the , forum, one observer, Draeconea, grumbled that character movements appeared â€œunnatural ...They run as if having a sore back, and got several planks of wood underneath their clothes.â€ù In another thread,  players argued about whether their avatars, or online beings, should be as powerful as a main Tolkien character like Aragorn.,Concerning these and other details, Mr. Anderson said that â€œthereâ€™s been lots of debate about it.â€ù He added,  â€œWeâ€™re going to continue to listen to the community about these topics.â€ù,Until recently, the job of interpreting Tolkien has fallen to Tolkien experts, not film or video-game directors. While many scholars are tolerant of the blockbuster adaptations, a few would prefer that  â€œRingsâ€ù remain a reading experience, not a virtual playground.,An online game â€œmay indeed trivialize Tolkienâ€™s legacy,â€ù Wayne G. Hammond, co-author of the â€œJ. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide,â€ù said in an e-mail interview, â€œif one comes to view â€˜The Lord of the Ringsâ€™ as popular culture more than as a work of literature, or feels that it cannot be a serious work of literature if it has outgrowths in popular culture.â€ù,The game may signal â€œdemocratization,â€ù he said, â€œbut it isnâ€™t Tolkien.â€ù,So far, reviews on sites like , and , have been positive. Tolkienâ€™s United States publisher, Houghton Mifflin, also is enthusiastic. â€œOur hope for the new game is the same hope we held during the time of the films,â€ù said Webster Younce, senior editor at Houghton Mifflin, â€œthat people who might not have read Tolkien will want to go directly to the source.â€ù",ETHAN GILSDORF,"JAN. 24, 2007",Building Middle-Earth: â€˜The Lord of the Ringsâ€™ Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/arts/design/24ring.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is mystifying that the Mexican pianist Jorge Federico Osorio does not have more of a presence in the New York concert world. Having won several competitions in the early 1970s, he waited until 1997 to make his New York recital debut. He hasnâ€™t been back much since, but his recordings of Spanish and Mexican music have attracted notice, and on Monday evening he played a hefty, colorful program at Alice Tully Hall that reinforced the impression he made a decade ago.,Three Soler sonatas established several of Mr. Osarioâ€™s strengths at the outset. Not least among them are a bright but warm tone, the technique and finger power required for Solerâ€™s rapid-fire repeating notes, and the elegance to illuminate the exotic Classicism that drives these works and is their link to Scarlatti on one hand, and Mozart on the other.,The Romantic and picturesque side of the Spanish repertory turned up on the second half of the program, when Mr. Osorio offered AlbÃ©nizâ€™s â€œSuite EspaÃ±olaâ€ù No. 1 in a reading notable for its high-energy performances of â€œGranada,â€ù with its lilting melody weaving through guitarlike figuration, and â€œAsturias,â€ù in which a serpentine theme is wrapped in a hypnotic tremolando figure.,Between the Soler and the AlbÃ©niz, Mr. Osorio played a vibrant, tempestuous account of Beethovenâ€™s Sonata No. 30 (Op. 109), with a magnificently cathartic finale, and a group of Debussyâ€™s Preludes that drew on Mr. Osorioâ€™s considerable imagination for subtle timbres and vivid characterization. He closed the program with two Liszt works, a beautifully articulated â€œJeux dâ€™eau Ã  la Villa dâ€™Esteâ€ù and an explosively virtuosic â€œVallÃ©e dâ€™Oberman.â€ù,Occasionally, the forcefulness of Mr. Osorioâ€™s style led him to step on melodies, particularly at phrase endings, or to smudge a texture here or a harmony there. But the sweep and freshness of his readings made his performance impossible to resist, technical quibbles notwithstanding.",ALLAN KOZINN,"JAN. 24, 2007","Returning to New York, Forcefully",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/arts/music/24osor.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who would have imagined that watching a stranger undress could ever be tedious?,Well, over the past few years choreographers have managed the impossible, making every effort to yank skivvies off whenever remotely necessary, and especially when it isnâ€™t.,But fear not. The French are here to save the day. Really.,On Thursday Martine Pisaniâ€™s â€œBande Ã  Partâ€ù (â€œBand of Outsidersâ€ù) opened at ,. There was plenty of nudity: indeed, you could make the case that the performance hinged on it. Itâ€™s just that none of it was actual.,The work began with ThÃ©o Kooijman walking the audience through his conceptual disrobing. â€œO.K., I got through the first part,â€ù he explained after a pause in which nothing happened, and in which you realized that nothing was going to. The joke, of course, is that you felt his nakedness all the more.,Such absurd and obvious manipulation of reality lay at the heart of this hourlong solo, cleverly disguised as a quartet. Christophe Ives, Eduard Mont de Palol, Olivier Schram and Mr. Kooijman, delightful dancers all, took turns performing a simple movement monologue, which included things like losing yourself for 23 seconds and finding yourself in seven; warming up and then passing that heat on to the audience through methods like vigorous rubbing and fanning, and that old standby, disappearing.,Each man interpreted this script (the â€œsoloistâ€™s storyâ€ù was read early on) in his own way and seemingly off the cuff, often ceding the soloist role to another performer in midstream.,The revolving backup threesome served to enhance and frame the action; think of the peanut gallery, not a Greek chorus. They burbled and chirped when it seemed their lead was in danger of nodding off. They created sound effects through methods that give new meaning to the description â€œlow techâ€ù; at one point Mr. Mont de Palol zipped and unzipped his fly to great effect. They galloped around awkwardly like men who canâ€™t quite get their minds around the concept.,And they created, through such winning and inane shenanigans, a reality that was just as forceful as the workaday version youâ€™re normally told to believe.

"A disputed report on the Web site of a conservative magazine about ,â€™s childhood schooling kicked off a pointed exchange this week between the rival cable news networks CNN and Fox News, when CNN seemed to make an overt effort both to debunk the report and to question the quality of Fox Newsâ€™s journalism.,The original report, posted on the online version of Insight, a magazine owned by The Washington Times, said that as a child in Indonesia, Mr. Obama had attended a madrassa, a school that teaches a radical version of the Muslim faith. Mr. Obama, who spent a few years in Jakarta as a boy, is a Christian.,Adding to the political volatility of the report was the attribution of the news to â€œresearchers connected toâ€ù Senator ,.,The two senators are expected to be the leading candidates for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, attracting intense news coverage, and the sparring between CNN and Fox News, which are often described as ideological opposites, may be a prelude to more accusations of inaccurate reporting.,The back-and-forth also comes amid a backdrop of increasingly nasty competition between the two networks, with CNN trying to promote the quality of its journalism as a counter to Foxâ€™s ratings. Fox continues to command by far the largest news audience in cable television.,Representatives of Mr. Obama of Illinois and Mrs. Clinton of New York denounced the Insight report, calling it false and an effort by a conservative publication to smear two Democratic contenders at the same time.,The Fox News Channel discussed the report on two of its programs. It was also picked up by The New York Post, which shares ownership with Fox News, and was discussed by several conservative talk-radio hosts.,Yesterday, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Howard Wolfson, said in an e-mail message: â€œThis is a textbook example of how the other side works. A right-wing rag makes up a scurrilous charge and prints it with no real attribution. The smear gets injected into the atmosphere and picked up by talk radio. In this case both Senator Obama and Senator Clinton were victimized.â€ù,A spokesman for Mr. Obama had previously been quoted in The Washington Post as calling the report â€œappallingly irresponsible.â€ù,On its Web site yesterday, Insight defended its report, saying, â€œOur reporterâ€™s sources close to the Clinton opposition research war room confirm the truth of the story.â€ù,CNNâ€™s political director, Sam Feist, said he had seen the Insight report discussed on â€œFox and Friends.â€ù Mr. Feist said he wanted to determine the validity of what he said, if true, would be a â€œholy-cow political story,â€ù so he sent a correspondent, John Vause, to Jakarta from Beijing. Mr. Vauseâ€™s report, broadcast Monday on CNN, described the Jakarta school as unaffiliated with Islamic fundamentalism.

As Fox News has in every story on the madrassa accusations, Mr. Gibson used the attribution â€œaccording to Insight magazine.â€ù But he also said: â€œLook at what some anti-Obama Democrats are doing to her political rival now.

You send a reporter, check the facts, and you decide at home.â€ù,A Fox News spokeswoman, Irena Briganti, said CNN was mainly looking for publicity in attacking its higher-rated rival.

"BERLIN, Jan. 24 â€” SAP, the biggest maker of business management software, said Wednesday that it would invest as much as $520 million over two years on an organization aimed at smaller business clients.,Some analysts said the plan for the investment showed that the company had exhausted its lucrative focus on large global corporations.,The  move, which SAP said would trim its profit margin to 26 percent to 27 percent this year, from a previously announced 30 percent, sent shares of the company plunging as much as 6 percent.,Investors focused on the cost of the initiative, even though SAP reported that profit rose 29 percent in the fourth quarter, to $1.03 billion, as sales rose 7 percent, to almost $3.9 billion.,Analysts said the focus on smaller clients showed that SAPâ€™s business was maturing and that its days of rapid growth might be coming to an end.,â€œBasically I think the financial markets are going to have to adjust their perception of SAP,â€ù said John Segrich, a software analyst at JPMorgan in London. â€œIn the past, the markets have become accustomed to turbocharged growth rates from SAP, but their core business is changing.â€ù,In two of four quarters in the last year, SAP failed to meet analystsâ€™ expectations. For 2006, SAP had predicted that software sales would rise 15 to 17 percent, but sales rose only 11 percent from 2005. Analysts tied the slowdown to reduced business spending on corporate software, the rise of niche competitors nibbling at SAPâ€™s market and the  saturation of SAPâ€™s traditional pool of clients, the large multinational companies.,SAPâ€™s chief executive, Henning Kagermann, said SAP was accelerating efforts begun a few years ago to cater to smaller businesses, which were not  a priority when the company was expanding to become the biggest software maker in Germany and the third-largest in the world after Microsoft and I.B.M.,Mr. Kagermann said SAP would aggressively serve smaller clients with its All-in-One business software suite in 2007.,In an interview, the companyâ€™s president, Leo Apotheker, disputed the notion that SAPâ€™s profit and sales prospects were dimming, saying that SAPâ€™s accelerated focus on small and midsize clients was expected to produce 10,000 new customers and $1.3 billion in new sales revenue by 2010.,â€œWe donâ€™t know where this feeling is coming from,â€ù Mr. Apotheker said. â€œWe have produced double-digit growth for the third straight year. We doubled our software revenue in the U.S. in three years. We said today that we believe our traditional business will grow at double-digit rates for the considerable future. We just want to accelerate that growth.â€ù,But Theo Kitz, an analyst at Merck Finck, a private bank in Munich, said SAPâ€™s growth prospects peaked a few years ago.,The company, founded in 1972, equips 38,000 businesses with software for internal functions like accounting, personnel, sales and executive controls. In a sense, SAP is becoming a victim of its own success, Mr. Kitz said.,Serving smaller businesses is more costly for companies like SAP because there are many of them and their needs tend to be more varied, requiring bigger sales and support teams, Mr. Kitz said. Smaller businesses typically also take longer to make buying decisions and require more intensive sales advice than larger enterprises.",KEVIN J.

"Washington,HERE we are in another flu season, and this time there is plenty of vaccine to go around. The federal government helped increase  the supply by subsidizing factories that make pandemic flu vaccine and by recommending that a total of 218 million Americans get flu shots â€” the sick, the elderly, the late middle-aged and children under 5.,But now state and county officials expect to throw away millions of doses. This situation reflects our blasÃ© attitude toward vaccination. Most of us consider influenza more a nuisance than a danger, except in old people. Of the 36,000 Americans who die of flu each year, most are over 65. And we assume that the elderly take their doctorsâ€™ advice to get vaccinated.,In fact, the immune systems of the old and infirm donâ€™t respond efficiently to the flu vaccine. A better way to protect the elderly from flu, studies have shown, is to vaccinate their nurses and caretakers, their children and grandchildren.,The logic behind giving shots to those who are not as vulnerable (children generally experience flu as a mild disease) is part of a concept called herd immunity. We protect the weaker lambs by bolstering the foldâ€™s communal defenses.,Unfortunately, the idea of herd immunity has lost respect. In the past decade, the number of parents who refuse vaccinations of any kind for their children has more than doubled.,But our dismissive attitude toward flu shots amounts to a  poor public health strategy. It not only makes the weakest more vulnerable, it also destabilizes the demand for vaccine in general, prompting vaccine makers to limit production â€” and that could lead to a critical shortage in the event of a flu pandemic.,Vaccination has inspired a degree of public loathing in America ever since 1721, when Cotton Mather introduced variolation, a primitive form of vaccination against smallpox, in Boston. It involved scratching live smallpox virus into a personâ€™s arm, and Bostonians found it alarming.,Over the next 200 years, vaccines improved, but public skepticism persisted. During the smallpox epidemics of the early 20th century, Americans rightly worried that unsanitary smallpox vaccinations could infect their children with tetanus and other bacterial diseases. People protested vaccination orders, sometimes violently. In one episode in Greenwood, Del., in 1926, a gang led by a former army lieutenant engaged in street fights that lasted several days.,But  World War II changed peopleâ€™s attitudes toward vaccines. Medics inoculated military recruits with vaccines against diseases like typhoid, yellow fever, tetanus and typhus. Some of the vaccines were pretty near experimental, yet our men survived, whipped the Axis powers and came home with a positive attitude toward public health.,By 1947, when a dozen people in Manhattan were infected by smallpox, six million New Yorkers lined up to have the vaccine scratched into the skin of their arms and legs upon the urging of Israel Weinstein, the city health commissioner.,The smallpox vaccine turned out to be far more lethal than the disease outbreak itself, which had claimed only two lives. The vaccine killed at least eight and in as many as 100 other people it caused side effects including severe rashes and brain damage. Yet no one publicly complained about this risk.,In the spring of 1955, Jonas Salkâ€™s polio vaccine was licensed. And although some early bad batches of it killed or paralyzed 174 people, a relieved nation recognized its greater benefit. Salk floated across the public stage like a white-jacketed saint.,With the advent of vaccines against measles, rubella and mumps, the 1960s became the golden age of vaccination. But gradually, people grew complacent about the good vaccines could do; the more vaccines eliminated disease, the less important they seemed.,Public apathy turned to distrust in 1998, when a new vaccine against rotavirus, which causes gastrointestinal illness in infants, showed signs of causing a bowel obstruction in very rare cases. The next year, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories,withdrew the vaccine, RotaShield,  from the market.,Around the same time, pediatricians raised concerns about the use of a preservative, thimerosal,   in vaccines for children. Thimerosal contains only minuscule amounts of mercury, but as a precaution, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked vaccine makers to remove the preservative from pediatric vaccines.,By and large this new safety consciousness was a good thing, but caution also has its costs. The withdrawal of the RotaShield vaccine, which caused bowel obstruction in only about 1 in 20,000 children, meant that thousands of American infants who would otherwise have been vaccinated suffered severely dehydrating diarrhea. And in developing countries, where rotavirus kills hundreds of thousands of babies each year, the vaccine was never introduced.,The removal of thimerosal set off angry recriminations against vaccines in general. Thousands of parents of autistic children, searching for a way to explain their childrenâ€™s illness, settled on thimerosal-containing vaccines and began suing the drug industry and the government. Although these suits seem unlikely to succeed â€” no clear evidence of a link between thimerosal and autism has been found â€” they have already cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in court costs, and they have helped undercut public confidence in vaccination.,Parents are now especially reluctant to inoculate children against flu, because many flu vaccines contain thimerosal. But the tiny amount of thimerosal in the vaccines is not a health threat. There is always a small risk of unforeseen side effects, but it pales next to the harm done by influenza every year â€” and the harm it could do in the future if we have an inadequate supply of vaccine.,We donâ€™t know whether the deadly avian flu virus, which has claimed a small number of victims in Asia and Africa, will evolve in a way that allows it to sweep across the globe. But the experts are certain that it is only a matter of time before a flu pandemic strikes. Keeping the vaccine pipeline running and building immunity against all types of flu will  help us prepare. Even in apparently humdrum flu years like this one, it behooves us to join the herd and be vaccinated.",ARTHUR ALLEN,"JAN. 25, 2007",For the Good of the Herd,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/opinion/25allen.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Charles Roselli set out to discover what makes some sheep gay. Then the news media and the blogosphere got hold of the story.,Dr. Roselli, a researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University, has searched for the past five years for physiological factors that might explain why about 8 percent of rams seek sex exclusively with other rams instead of ewes. The goal, he says, is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of sexual orientation in sheep. Other researchers might some day build on his findings to seek ways to determine which rams are likeliest to breed, he said.,But since last fall, when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals started a campaign against the research, it has drawn a torrent of outrage from animal rights activists, gay advocates and ordinary citizens around the world â€” all of it based, Dr. Roselli and colleagues say, on a bizarre misinterpretation of what the work is about.,The story of the gay sheep became a textbook example of the distortion and vituperation that can result when science meets the global news cycle.,The news media storm reached its zenith last month, when The Sunday Times in London published an article under the headline â€œScience Told: Hands Off Gay Sheep.â€ù It asserted, incorrectly, that Dr. Roselli had worked successfully to â€œcureâ€ù homosexual rams with hormone treatments, and added that â€œcritics fearâ€ù that the research â€œcould pave the way for breeding out homosexuality in humans.â€ù,Martina Navratilova, the tennis star who is both openly gay and a PETA ally, wrote in an open letter that the research â€œcan only be surmised as an attempt to develop a prenatal treatmentâ€ù for sexual conditions.,The controversy spilled into the blog world, with attacks on Dr. Roselli, his university and Oregon State University, which is also involved in the research. PETA began an e-mail campaign that the universities say resulted in 20,000 protests, some with language like â€œyou are a worthless animal killer and you should be shot,â€ù â€œI hope you burn in hellâ€ù and â€œplease, die.â€ù,The news coverage, which has been heaviest in England and Australia, focused on smirk and titillation â€” and, of course, puns. Headlines included â€œEwe Turn for Gay Rams on Hormonesâ€ù and â€œHeâ€™s Just Not That Into Ewe.â€ù,In recent weeks, the tide has begun to turn, with Dr. Roselli and Jim Newman, an Oregon Health and Science publicist, saying they have been working to correct the record in print and online. The university has sent responses to senders of each PETA-generated e-mail message.,Dr. Roselli, whose research is supported by the National Institutes of Health and is published in leading scientific journals, insists that he is as repulsed as his critics by the thought of sexual eugenics in humans. He said  human sexuality was a complex phenomenon that could not be reduced to interactions of brain structure and hormones.,On blogs where attacks have appeared, the researchers point out that many of the accusations, like The Sunday Timesâ€™s assertion that the scientists implant devices in the brains of the sheep, are simply false.,The researchers acknowledge that the sheep are killed in the course of the research so  their brain structure can be analyzed, but they say they follow animal welfare guidelines to prevent suffering.,The authors of the Sunday Times article, Chris Gourlay and Isabel Oakeshott, referred questions to a managing editor, who they said was traveling and could not be reached.,Dr. Roselli and Mr. Newman persuaded some prominent bloggers, including Andrew Sullivan, who writes an online column for Time, to correct postings that had uncritically quoted The Sunday Timesâ€™s article. They also found an ally in the blog world: a scientist who writes under the pseudonym emptypockets and has taken up Dr. Roselliâ€™s cause.  The blogger, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said a public stand could hurt his career, said he had been cheered by the number of bloggers who dropped their opposition when presented with the facts.,Ms. Navratilova, who also received a response from the university, said she remained unconvinced.,â€œThe more we play God or try to improve on Mother Nature, the more damage we are doing with all kinds of experiments that either have already turned or will turn into nightmares,â€ù she wrote in an e-mail reply to a reporterâ€™s query. â€œHow in the world could straight or gay sheep help humanity?â€ù,In an interview, Shalin Gala, a PETA representative working on the sheep campaign, said controlling or altering sexual orientation was a â€œnatural implicationâ€ù of the work of Dr. Roselli and his colleagues.,Mr. Gala, who asked that he be identified as openly gay, cited the news release for a 2004 paper in the journal Endocrinology that showed differences in brain structure between homosexual and heterosexual sheep.,The release quoted Dr. Roselli as saying that the research â€œalso has broader implications for understanding the development and control of sexual motivation and mate selection across mammalian species, including humans.â€ù,Mr. Newman, who wrote the release, said the word â€œcontrolâ€ù was used in the scientific sense of understanding the bodyâ€™s internal controls, not in the sense of trying to control sexual orientation.,â€œItâ€™s discouraging that PETA can pick one word, try to add weight to it or shift its meaning to suggest that you are doing something that you clearly are not,â€ù he said.,Dr. Roselli said that merely mentioning possible human implications of basic research was wildly different from intending to carry the work over to humans.,Mentioning human implications, he said, is â€œin the nature of the way we write our grantsâ€ù and talk to reporters. Scientists who do basic research find themselves in a bind, he said, adding,  â€œWe have been forced to draw connections in a way that we can justify our research.â€ù,As for whether the deaths of the sheep are justified, he said, â€œwhy would you pick on a guy whoâ€™s killing maybe 18 sheep a year, when thereâ€™s maybe four million killed for food and clothing in this country?â€ù,Paul Root Wolpe, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and a senior fellow at the universityâ€™s Center for Bioethics, said that although he supported Dr. Roselliâ€™s research, â€œIâ€™m not sure I would let him off the hook quite as easily as he wants to be let off the hook.â€ù,By discussing the human implications of the research, even in a somewhat careful way, Dr. Roselli â€œopened the doorâ€ù to the reaction, Dr. Wolpe said, and â€œhe has to take responsibility for the public response.â€ù,If the mechanisms underlying sexual orientation can be discovered and manipulated, Dr. Wolpe continued, then the argument that sexual orientation is based in biology and is immutable â€œevaporates.â€ù,The prospect of parentsâ€™ eventually being able to choose not to have children who would become gay is a real concern for the future, Dr. Wolpe said. But he added, â€œThis concern is best addressed by trying to change public perceptions of homosexuality rather than stop basic science on sexuality.â€ù",JOHN SCHWARTZ,"JAN. 25, 2007","Of Gay Sheep, Modern Science and Bad Publicity",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/science/25sheep.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scientists have built a memory chip that is roughly the size of a white blood cell,  about one-2,000th of an inch on a side.,Although the chip is modest in capacity â€” with 160,000 bits of information â€” the bits are crammed together so tightly that it is the densest ever made. The achievement points to a possible path toward continuing the exponential growth of computing power even after current silicon chip-making technology hits fundamental limits in 10 to 20 years.,The scientists, led by James R. Heath of the California Institute of Technology and J. Fraser Stoddart of the University of California, Los Angeles, will report their findings today in the journal Nature. As far back as 1999, Dr. Heath and Dr. Stoddart reported on aspects of their work , which included specially designed molecular switches and a novel technique for making ultrathin wires. The new work pulls the components into an integrated circuit.,â€œOur goal always was to develop a manufacturing technique that works at the molecular scale,â€ù said Dr. Heath, a professor of chemistry. â€œItâ€™s a scientific demonstration, but itâ€™s a sort of a stake in the ground.â€ù,The density of bits on the chip â€” about 100 billion per square centimeter â€” is about 40 times as much as current memory chips, Dr. Heath said. Improvements to the technique could increase the density by a factor of 10, he said.,But Dr. Heath said he did not know if this technique would be commercially useful. â€œI donâ€™t know if the world needs memory like this,â€ù he said. â€œI do know if you can manufacture at these dimensions, itâ€™s a fundamentally enabling capability.â€ù,For example, the wires used in the chip are about the same width as proteins, and that could make possible tiny circuits that could detect cancer or other diseases. The researchers are making transistors and simple logic circuits using similar techniques, Dr. Heath said.,A crucial component of the chip is its molecular switch, designed by Dr. Stoddart. The switch, which belongs to a class of molecules known as rotaxanes, looks like a dumbbell with a ring that can slide along the central bar. Voltage pulses push the ring between two positions on the bar, which represent the zeros and ones used by computers to store data. The dumbbell shape keeps the ring from sliding off.,To build the chip, the researchers etched 400 parallel wires, each less than a millionth of an inch wide and separated by about one-750,000th of an inch from its neighbors. On top of the wires, they deposited a layer of the molecular switches, the dumbbells standing vertically, and then a second set of 400 wires turned 90 degrees to the first set.,Each crossing point between two perpendicular wires, with about 100 of the molecular switches wedged in between, is the storage location of one bit of information.,While many researchers are looking for ways to make molecular-size electronics, most are still building circuits containing only a handful of bits, compared with the 160,000 in the new chip. That suggests the new process Dr. Heath and Dr. Stoddart developed can be scaled up to a viable manufacturing process, said Vivek Subramanian, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.,â€œThis is sort of the capstone in that theyâ€™ve pulled all this together,â€ù said Dr. Subramanian, who was not involved in the research.,Not everything about the chip works yet. When the researchers tested a small part of it, they found that only 30 percent of the bits actually worked.  But it is possible to use only the working parts of the chip, and the researchers successfully wrote and read information to those parts, though even there the success was temporary. The switches routinely broke after being flipped about 10 times.,The researchers readily  concede that their chip is merely a demonstration and is not refined enough for any applications. â€œWeâ€™re just happy it works,â€ù Dr. Heath said.",KENNETH CHANG,"JAN. 25, 2007",Researchers Go Molecular in Design of a Denser Chip,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/science/25chip.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AT this time of year there isnâ€™t a lot to do in Warroad, Minn., a little town at the southwestern end of the Lake of the Woods, just a few miles from the Canadian border. There is no movie theater, the one bowling alley closed a while ago and the nearest shopping mall is in Grand Forks, N.D., two and half hours away across a windswept plain. You can snowmobile, but the snowfall has been a little skimpy so far this winter. Or you can ice fish, though until just a couple of weeks ago, when the temperature finally plunged to double digits below, it might have been unwise to drive a pickup out onto the lake.,Or like many Warroad residents, you can flock to the Gardens, the townâ€™s main ice rink, especially on a night when the Warroad High School Warriors are playing. What basketball is to Indiana and football is to Texas, hockey is to ,, a passion so intense that it borders on civic religion. And even in this hockey-mad state, Warroad, which bills itself as Hockeytown U.S.A. and displays a pair of crossed hockey sticks on the town water tower, is legendary for its fervor.,The Gardens is a kind of oasis â€” a place to see your neighbors, escape from the grind of a long northern winter and even enjoy a vicarious thrill or two, watching the Warriors cream Crookston or Thief River. Teenagers flirt here. Friends catch up on the news. Mothers bring their kids and let them zip around the lobby on their wheeled sneakers. The railbirds, the guys too nervous to sit, stand in the corner and never take their eyes off the ice.,â€œWhat else are you going to do up here?â€ù said Ruben Bjorkman, a longtime observer of the local hockey culture. â€œItâ€™s cold.â€ù,There are people who even make a point of attending not just the games but even the high school practice every afternoon, among them such local eminences as Mr. Bjorkman, a two-time Olympic player (1948 and 1952) who went on to a successful college coaching career and now keeps an eye on his grandson, Andy Stoskopf, a sophomore Warrior; and Gordon Christian, known for some reason as Ginny, who played for the 1956 Olympic team and is now the townâ€™s walking repository of hockey lore. For these men, and for lots of people in town, watching hockey isnâ€™t just a pastime, itâ€™s part of the fabric of small-town life.,The neighboring town of Roseau, 20 miles down Highway 11, is just as besotted, maybe more so, and the rivalry between them, going back 60 years or so, is probably the most famous and most intense in the  state. The teams play each other twice every season, and those two evenings are among the biggest events all winter. People look forward to them for weeks, and replay them in conversations for days afterward.,Like most great rivalries, this one is between two places that are more alike than not, and entails unspoken elements of fondness and respect as well as of enmity. There was some genuinely bad blood a couple of years ago when it was proposed that the county courthouse be moved from Roseau to Warroad, but in most respects Warroad and Roseau are siblings of a sort â€” little towns in the middle of nowhere that have evolved in much the same way and see each other almost as mirror images, real-life Lake Woebegons. Breanna Jackson, an 11th grader at Warroad High, explained the delicate nature of the relationship this way: â€œI could date a boy from Roseau, but I would never root for them.â€ù,ROSEAU, the county seat, is larger, with a population of 2,700, and to judge from some of the big, two-story houses in the residential neighborhoods, a little more prosperous. Warroad (population 1,700) has the prettier setting, along the lake and the Warroad River, and is socially more diverse, with a sizable Ojibwe population and a growing number of Hmong people from Laos. Both towns are the kinds of places where in wintertime people leave their cars and trucks running and unlocked while they do errands or stop off for a cup of coffee, the unofficial state beverage. And far from being wary or standoffish, the townspeople in both are startlingly, almost unnaturally friendly.,For places so small, both towns have nurtured an exceptional amount of standout hockey talent. This is in part because Warroad, with two rinks, and Roseau, with three, not to mention a couple of well-maintained outdoor rinks, offer hours and hours of instruction and ice time (all free) to local kids; and in part, no doubt, because the local culture inevitably turns hockey players into celebrities.,â€œThey , hockey here,â€ù said a Warroad student who was apparently one of the few nonbelievers in town.,Warroad has the edge in former Olympians, thanks mostly to a single family, the Christians: Ginny played on the 1956 team, his brothers Bill and Roger won gold medals with the 1960 team and also played in â€™64, and Billâ€™s son Dave played on the gold-medal-winning 1980 team. Roseau boasts more National Hockey League players, including four from a single block: Bryan Erickson, who played for four clubs in the â€™80s and early â€™90s, and the three Brotens: Neal, Aaron and Paul.,â€œGrowing up, I never dreamed of playing pro hockey,â€ù Mr. Erickson said recently. â€œI wasnâ€™t even the best player on my street.â€ù Neal Broten (one of the stars of the 1980 Olympic team) is considered by many the best college player in Minnesota history. The best high school player is probably Warroadâ€™s Henry Boucha, who spent parts of six seasons in the N.H.L. before getting butt-ended in the eye. But he is more famous for his heroic performance in what is often recalled as the best high school game ever, the 1969 state final between Warroad and Edina. Hockey fans in Minnesota actually remember these things.,This year, Roseau, ranked seventh in the state, was in theory a slight favorite, but the nature of the rivalry is such that rankings donâ€™t matter much and upsets happen all the time. To complicate matters, the brand-new Warroad coach, Bruce Olson, is himself a Roseau alumnus, and the most likely starting goalie for the Warriors, Jacob Vatnsdal, is a Roseau resident who  transferred to Warroad to get more playing time. The prospect of Jacob representing Warroad against Roseau delighted some in town but made others uneasy. â€œI wouldnâ€™t feel right doing that,â€ù said John Heneman, a banker and one of the town fathers. â€œPlay for my rival?â€ù,For budgetary reasons, Warroad had to cut out cheerleading this year, so on game day, Jan. 11, there werenâ€™t as many hallway signs as usual at the high school. But lots of girls and even some teachers turned up wearing yellow and black, the team colors, and some of them â€” the students, that is â€” were also in shorts or miniskirts. (Going bare-legged in midwinter is apparently a form of Minnesota machisma.) As is customary on game days, the members of the hockey team were all wearing neckties, and most of them were so wound up that going to class was torture.,In midafternoon, just as school was letting out, Tim Oshie, the junior varsity coach, organized what was billed as â€œA Night With the Roseau-Warroad Hockey Legends,â€ù 10 veterans from each town who happened to include six Olympians and five former N.H.L.â€™ers. They joked, swapped war stories and ribbed each other until Henry Boucha got serious for a minute.,â€œOne of the highlights of my career was playing in that state final that year,â€ù he said. â€œJust playing for your community, thatâ€™s the greatest gift for an athlete. The Olympics was the same type of deal, only there we were playing for a national community, the United States. Itâ€™s an immense feeling, like having sex for the first time.â€ù,An hour before game time the rink was more than half full, with people continuing to stream in from the parking lot â€” or lumber in, rather. It was 10 below, and the wind so sharp it sawed at your ears. Many families had made a night of it, with dinner beforehand at the Main Street Bar and Grill or at Shirleyâ€™s, across the street from the rink. The final attendance was estimated to be 2,800, not quite standing-room only because the game was televised on Fox Sports North, but nevertheless more than half the combined populations of the two towns, who greeted each other like relatives at a family reunion.,The crowd included at least four generations of hockey fans, if you count babies in plastic carriers, and all the essential high school subgroups: jocks, band kids, theater kids, bare-legged cuties, even a few goths. The Warroad band, which has a big-school percussion section, played â€œLouie Louieâ€ù and, when the team took the ice, the Atlanta Bravesâ€™ â€œTomahawk Chopâ€ù song. Over on the Roseau side, a kid wearing a giant green ramâ€™s head led a green-suited (and, in some cases, green-faced) cheering section. You could hardly hear yourself think.,THE game itself was about as good as high-school hockey gets, which is to say, as good as hockey gets: fast, intense and full of passion. Warroad jumped off to an early one-goal lead and clung to it through the first period, with the help of some acrobatic saves by Jacob Vatnsdal, who had been greeted by a hail of boos from the Roseau side but won  a lot of admirers among the locals, many of whom had never seen him play before. Still, Roseau scored a couple of power-play goals early in the second period and a third goal halfway through the third.,Warroad tried to rally behind the efforts of Aaron Marvin, who is among the best players in the state but was shadowed so closely it seemed as if vines were clinging to him. In the end Alex Bjerk, in the net for Roseau, made a couple of key saves and the clock ran down with Vatnsdal benched for an additional skater and the Warroad fans, down 3-1, still shrieking for one more chance. Afterward, the Roseau coach, Scott Oliver, who is from Winnipeg, said, â€œWhen I got here, I knew this game was big, but until youâ€™re in it, you have no idea.â€ù,Outside, it had dropped seven more degrees, and many fans drove home to hook their engine-block heaters up to electrical umbilical cords.,In just a couple of weeks, on Jan. 30, everyone would get to do this all over again cheer, suffer, exult, despair â€” only in Roseau this time, where the rink is much older than Warroadâ€™s 14-year-old building. The Roseau Memorial Arena is an old, wood-ceilinged ark of a place with a pine-paneled lobby dinged from decades of floor hockey games.,There is actually a brand-new rink in town, right next to the high school, but the Rams prefer the old one, where they and their fans can commune with the past.",CHARLES McGRATH,"JAN. 26, 2007","A Game?

"If thereâ€™s one sure thing about the future, itâ€™s that it always takes longer to arrive than you think it will.,Here we are in 2007, and the interstellar space travel depicted in â€œ2001â€ù is still a sci-fi fantasy. Heck, we havenâ€™t even reached the society of mind control imagined in â€œ1984.â€ù (Insert your own joke about politics or advertising here.),So when the pundits tell you that the death of the DVD is imminent, that weâ€™ll soon get all our movies instantaneously from the Internet, some skepticism is in order.,Already, you can buy movies from iTunes, for example, but the selection is tiny (250 movies), and you pay about as much as you would for a DVD. CinemaNow and MovieLink offer online movie â€œrentalsâ€ù for about $4. But again, the selection is fairly small, at least once you subtract the mind-boggling gigabytes of B movies â€” more like C or D movies â€” like â€œAddicted to Murder III: Bloodlustâ€ù and â€œWitchcraft XI: Sisters in Blood.â€ù The copy protection is a bit overbearing, too. You can download a movie, all right, but it self-destructs 24 hours later.,All of these services permit you to start watching a movie after only a minute or so, before itâ€™s been fully downloaded â€” but you canâ€™t fast forward (or, in some cases, even rewind) until youâ€™ve got the whole thing on your hard drive.,Last week, a new contender entered the field with a radically different approach to Internet movies: Netflix.,Now, this isnâ€™t the first time â€œradically differentâ€ù was applied to a Netflix business model. Its main service, renting DVDs by mail, entails no per-movie fee, no late fees and no shipping fees.,Instead, you pay a flat monthly fee to â€œcheck outâ€ù a certain number of DVDs at a time â€” $18 for three, for example. You keep them as long as you like. When you mail one back in its postage-paid, pre-addressed envelope, Netflix sends you the next one on your wish list automatically. So far, about six million people have signed up. (Blockbusterâ€™s similar DVD-by-mail service is also increasingly popular, thanks in part to a recently introduced twist: if you return a DVD to a Blockbuster store instead of mailing it, you get a free in-store rental on the spot.),Once again, Netflix has rewritten the rules â€” this time, of the online movie-rental game. The company has done away with expiration dates, copy protection and multi-megabyte downloads. Thatâ€™s because you donâ€™t actually download any of Netflixâ€™s movies; instead, they â€œstreamâ€ù in real time from the Internet to your computer. (This advantage comes with a key disadvantage: you must be connected to the Internet. Wireless hot spots at airports and hotels are fair game, but movies canâ€™t be carried around on a laptop.),Netflix has also done away with per-movie fees â€” in fact,  there are no additional fees for watching movies online at all. Instead, the Netflix service is free if youâ€™re already a Netflix DVD-by-mail subscriber. When you log in to Netflix.com, you see a new tab called Watch Now. It opens what looks like a duplicate set of the companyâ€™s usual excellent movie-finding and movie-recommending tools, except that you now see ,buttons beneath each movieâ€™s icon: Rent and Play.,(If you donâ€™t see the Watch Now tab yet, itâ€™s because Netflix is rolling out this service in phases to  250,000 customers at a time, to be completed by June. The idea is to avoid a technical meltdown. Your time will come.),The first time you click Play, youâ€™re sent a tiny software blob that takes under a minute to install, and doesnâ€™t require restarting your browser or PC. After that, when you click Play, the movie loads for a few seconds and then begins playing, right there in your Web browser. Thatâ€™s it: one click. No special program, no confirmation boxes, no credit card charges, no copy-protection hassles. The movie just begins to play â€” full-screen, if you wish. You can jump to any spot in the movie, although the movie takes a few seconds to â€œcatch upâ€ù each time you use the scroll bar.,Even more startling: Your movie watching is measured by time, not by individual movie title or by individual viewing.,The hours of movie watching you get each month depends on which DVD-by-mail plan you have. You get one hour of online movies per dollar of your monthly fee. So if you pay $6 a month (for the one-DVD-at-a-time plan), you can watch six hours of movies online; if you pay $18 (for the three-DVD plan), you can gorge yourself on 18 hours of online movies. And so on.,This innovative metering system has one minor drawback: rewinding to watch a favorite scene eats up a few more minutes of your monthly allotment.,But the huge, mind-bending, game-changing advantage of this model is that you can channel-surf movies just the way you channel-surf TV. You can watch 15 minutes of â€œSingle White Female,â€ù decide youâ€™re more in the mood for a documentary, and switch over to â€œSuper Size Me.â€ù When a buddy tells you that â€œTwisterâ€ù is lame except for the climactic final sequence, you can fast-forward right to that part. You can watch the beginning of â€œGladiatorâ€ù tonight, and watch the rest of it a month later, without having to re-rent it or pay late fees.,Or you can casually sample one movie after another, looking for something that grabs you.,Movie surfing like this has never been possible before. All other movie delivery formats require you to make your movie choice based only on the box shot, the movie trailer and a synopsis.,(Starzâ€™s Vongo service comes close; it offers unlimited movies for a flat $10 monthly. But you have to download a movie before you can watch it, which rules out this sort of casual real-time movie surfing.),Netflix-by-Internet, in other words, is deliciously immediate, incredibly economical and, because it introduces movie surfing, impressively convention-shattering.,It will not, however, change the way most people watch movies in the short term, for many reasons.,First, it works only on Windows PCs at the moment; a Macintosh version is in the works.,Second, only 1,000 movies and TV shows are on the Play list. Thereâ€™s lots of good, brand-name stuff here â€” â€œZoolander,â€ù â€œChinatown,â€ù â€œJaws,â€ù â€œSleepless in Seattle,â€ù â€œTwisterâ€ù and so on â€” but Netflixâ€™s lawyers and movie-studio negotiators have a long way to go before the number of movies online equals the number of DVDs available from Netflix (70,000). Still, the company says that at least 5,000 movies will be on the list by yearâ€™s end. So far, the sole holdout among major movie studios is Disney, perhaps because of its partnership with Appleâ€™s movie service.,Third, you generally get only the movie â€” not the DVD featurettes, alternate languages, subtitles, directorâ€™s commentary and so on.,Fourth, you canâ€™t control the video quality you get. Your movies arrive in one of three resolutions, depending solely on the speed of your broadband Internet connection. In the Basic version (for slow connections), the image is blurry and somewhat unsatisfying, like bad VHS. At Good, the picture looks about like regular TV. At High, youâ€™d swear youâ€™re looking at a DVD: razor-sharp image, superb color and shadows, perfect smooth motion. (Note to geeks: the Basic, Good and High versions correspond to minimum broadband speeds of 0.5, 1 and 1.6 megabits per second.),A prominent speed meter on the Netflix page tells you which version youâ€™ll get. You can click this graph repeatedly as you move your laptop around in an effort to improve your wireless signal.,Finally, remember the biggest drawback of Internet movie services: Only a nerd would gather the family around the PC to watch a movie.,The masses have yet to connect their computers to their TV sets. Only then will the decline of the DVD begin in earnest. Only then will the futuristsâ€™ fantasy of instant access to any movie, any time become a reality.,When that day arrives, Netflix, for one, will be ready.",,"JAN. 25, 2007","A Stream of Movies, Sort of Free",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/technology/25pogue.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Start with the children and work up from there. For corporate America and Washington policy experts, that seems to be the emerging consensus about how to begin tackling the problem of the 47 million people in this country without health insurance: Start with the more than  8 million uninsured children.,Then maybe add four million college students who do not have insurance but might not cost all that much to cover because they tend to be young and healthy.,Next might come  the 1.4 million or so uninsured people in households with total income at least $75,000, who are perhaps in a position to purchase insurance â€” if insurance became mandatory and if a market for affordable personal policies was created.,Those are among the ideas arising from corporate America as change in the nationâ€™s health insurance system seems increasingly to become a political imperative.,Employers, much of the glue holding the nationâ€™s piecemeal health care system together for  half a century, have been reluctant to agree to a larger government role in medical coverage. But straining under runaway costs for providing health insurance â€” partly because of the costs imposed on the medical system by people with no insurance at all â€” many executives and their representatives see the time as ripe for starting to overhaul the system.,â€œThere is more frustration and less acceptance of the current system among employers than we have ever seen in my 30 years in this field,â€ù said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, an organization made up of large companies.,As a starting point,  many employers and health care industry executives are pushing for expansion of the federal-state Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program, which covers children from families with incomes too high for Medicaid.,Increasing the funds and expanding eligibility, business leaders say,  would be an important start â€” not only in providing better care for the children, but in reducing the expensive visits to hospital emergency rooms that end up as higher costs for employers who pay for health care for the majority of American workers and their families.,The program, which depends on federal funds with matching grants from states, is up for renewal in Congress this year. The federal contribution is currently $5 billion a year. With the budget deficit a contentious matter, it will not be easy to enact that or any other new spending measure.,But the head of another representative of large corporations said that not taking action was no longer an option for American companies as they compete with foreign businesses whose governments shouldered medical and hospital costs.,â€œHealth costs are the single largest cost pressure that employers face â€” far exceeding energy, labor, material, even litigation,â€ù said John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an association of 165 of the largest companies.,The national grocery chain Safeway, for example, says the $1 billion it spent on employee health care last year exceeded its net income. By next year, that will be true for most large businesses, according to Safewayâ€™s chairman and chief executive, Steven A. Burd, who cited a McKinsey & Company study.,The November election results sent a message that voters want the government to address personal concerns like access to good health care, Mr. Castellani of the Business Roundtable said.,President Bush proposed his own approach in the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, though some Congressional Democrats are deriding it, saying it has no chance of passage.,But Democrats are pushing for new powers for Medicare to have a role in drug pricing, for example. And California has joined the states that are experimenting with mandatory health insurance for individuals and employers as a way to address the problems of the uninsured.,Mr. Burd, whose company  is based in California, has urged his counterparts  to support Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€™s proposal for requiring universal coverage of individuals who can afford it, while providing subsidies for low-income people to purchase policies.,Such requirements would mean creating a market for individual health policies that would resemble the market for car insurance, Mr. Burd said.,WellPoint, the largest health insurer, said it had been signing up about 380,000 previously uninsured people annually by devising new types of lower-price policies.,Jude Thompson, a senior vice president, said the company had made a target of the 18-to-34-year-old group â€”  sometimes called  â€œyoung invinciblesâ€ù â€” attracting  them with reduced premiums that are offset by higher annual deductibles of $1,500, and throwing in vision and dental benefits.,The insurance industry has both short- and long-term reasons for wanting market-based approaches to succeed, said Charles Boorady, a health care analyst at Citigroup. Short term, they get more customers. But in the longer run, â€œtheir biggest risk is nationalized health care.â€ù,The government already accounts for 40 percent of total health spending â€”  $1.99 trillion in 2005, Mr. Boorady said. â€œThe decision on should we nationalize all of it will be heavily influenced by the outcome of some of these state universal health plans,â€ù he said.,Jack O. Bovender, chief executive of HCA, the hospital company, said that a patchwork of state plans would not work. For one thing, he said, state regulation of health care financing had often been overturned by lawsuits filed under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which the courts have said was intended to let big companies set up uniform health benefits across the country, rather than navigate state-by-state requirements.,â€œUltimately there has to be a federal solution,â€ù Mr. Bovender said. But he cautioned, â€œI think we need to move quickly but not grab at what appear to be quick easy fixes; things that sound good always have unintended consequences.â€ù,Some business executives said they were reluctant to prescribe solutions. â€œWe certainly donâ€™t have it all figured out,â€ù H. Lee Scott, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores, said in a statement. The company is the nationâ€™s largest employer.,â€œWe have said all along that it is going to take businesses working with leaders in government, the health care industry and others to come up with health care solutions,â€ù Mr. Scott added.,Charles N. Kahn III, a longtime strategist  in the Washington health policy wars, said that the chances for government action were now unusually bright.,But even with a growing political will to tackle the problem, Mr. Kahn, who is president of the Federation of American Hospitals, is not expecting the complicated problems in the health care system  to be solved quickly. He cautioned that federal budget deficits made it â€œhard to visualize major health reform before the 2008 elections.â€ù",MILT FREUDENHEIM,"JAN. 25, 2007","With Health Care Topic A, Some Sketches for a Solution",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/business/25health.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Paying a hospital to do the right thing is a lot harder than it looks.,The  266 hospitals participating in a Medicare experiment that pays them more to follow medical recommendations have  steadily improved the quality of patient care.,The latest results in the three-year experiment show that more heart attack patients are getting aspirin when they arrive at the hospital, for example, and more patients are getting vaccines to prevent pneumonia.,But even some of the hospitals earning the largest payments say Medicare needs to develop a more sophisticated  way to reward hospitals for providing better care rather than more care.,The problem, they say, is that the experiment ranks hospitals and rewards only the top performers. It also tends to judge the hospitals more on whether they are offering certain treatments than on whether the care is actually benefiting patients.,â€œThis isnâ€™t the system they will ultimately use for large-scale pay for performance,â€ù said Dr. Charles A. Riccobono, the chief quality officer for Hackensack University Medical Center.,For the second year in a row the New Jersey hospital was the top performer in all five clinical areas that were measured by the program, and it is receiving a bonus of about $744,000.,Medicare officials are expected to announce  tomorrow that they are awarding performance bonuses of $8.7 million to the 115 hospitals that were the top performers for the second year, based on 30 quality measures.,But the Medicare officials also emphasize that the vast majority of hospitals were able to deliver better care. â€œWe continue to see improvement, quarter by quarter, in this cohort of hospitals,â€ù said Herb Kuhn, the acting deputy administrator for Medicare.,The hospitals experienced nearly 1,300 fewer deaths in treating heart attack patients, and they have generally been able to score higher on quality measures than the rest of the nationâ€™s hospitals.,Premier Inc., a nonprofit hospital alliance, is managing the project. Premier and Medicare  are now in discussions about whether the experiment will be extended, but Congress has also asked Medicare to look into  developing  a new payment system that would put more emphasis on rewarding the best care.,The experiment is an effort by Medicare to address a fundamental concern about the current payment system. Hospitals are not paid more when they help keep a heart-failure patient from coming back to the hospital, for example. The hospitals participating in this experiment are  being measured on whether they give patients clear instructions when they leave on how best to stay  healthy.,Medicare officials say they are encouraged by the programâ€™s results so far in supporting a move to a system that ties payments more closely to quality care. â€œWhat we see is a good trend here,â€ù Mr. Kuhn said.,Others agree that the experiment supports  the idea of rewarding good care. â€œI think it offers a lot of encouragement for the potential of linking even small amounts of pay to the reliability of care,â€ù said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit group based in Cambridge, Mass.,The financial incentives may not have been the driving force behind the improved care, but they focused the hospitalsâ€™ attention on whether they were actually providing patients the right treatments. â€œIt was attention-getting,â€ù Dr. Berwick  said.,Under the experiment, hospitals can earn a bonus only if they rank among the top 20 percent in at least one of five areas of patient care: joint replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, heart attack, heart failure or pneumonia.,The hospitals involved  say that  payment method  is not the best model for a nationwide system. Hospital payments should focus on encouraging hospitals to make significant strides in improving care, and should not be based on rankings. The hospitals say they are  now clustered so closely at the top that it is increasingly hard to qualify for extra payments, even if their results continue to improve.,â€œThe zebras are running faster and faster,â€ù said Regina Berman, the administrative director for performance improvement at Hackensack.,The hospitals also raise questions about the measures being used.,One hospital, for example, said it found itself focusing on how it was delivering care instead of looking at how patients were actually faring. The scoring system rewarded it for following the recommended medical treatments more frequently but did not take into account the need to make overall improvements that  actually improve care, said Liz Popwell, a vice president for Cleveland County HealthCare System in Shelby, N.C.,Any new payment system would need to emphasize patient outcomes, she said. â€œThere are some kinks that need to be worked out.â€ù,Hospitals also say that some of the measures  need to change more quickly when new research shows different treatments are better. At Hackensack, for example, doctors were already using a new drug to treat some heart attack patients, although they were being penalized for a time for not following the  treatments established under the experiment. Medicare officials were responsive, they said, and the new recommendations take into account the latest medical evidence.,Mr. Kuhn of Medicare says the agency is already looking at the experimentâ€™s results and talking with experts to try to figure out how to address some of the concerns. In addition to focusing on the right financial incentives, Medicare is also studying what measures to use and how hospitals will make public their progress. â€œWeâ€™re in the throes of it right now,â€ù he said.,The emphasis on bonuses for better performance may also be misguided, said some of the hospitals and Dr. Berwick of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.,â€œFrom our standpoint on this program, the pay was nice but not all that important,â€ù said Dr. Donald Blanford, the chief medical officer for Community Health Partners in Lorain, Ohio, who said the hospital was motivated more by the public reporting of its results. The payments generally covered the costs involved in making the improvements, he said.,And hospitals and others say the program was as successful as it was because of the sharing of information among  institutions about what worked and what did not.,â€œWe saw a major, rapid amount of knowledge transfer among hospitals,â€ù said Stephanie C. Alexander, a senior vice president at Premier and general manager of the health care informatics division involved in the experiment.,But the hospitals agree that the experiment suggests a move in the right direction. â€œItâ€™s a start, and weâ€™ll see where it leads,â€ù said Dr. Riccobono of Hackensack.",REED ABELSON,"JAN. 25, 2007",Bonus Pay by Medicare Lifts Quality,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/business/25care.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"REAL estate agents have a knack for investing any Manhattan neighborhood with romance, no matter how harsh or dowdy its past. The bloodstained meatpacking district in recent years has assumed a sudden charm. Then there's the Lower East Side, which has become a cradle to luxury condos after spending decades as a place where immigrants of all stripes strived to get to, then sought to leave as quickly as possible â€” a kind of perpetual springboard to a better life.,The Lower East Side of popular memory is often Jewish, but it's important to recall that the Chinese and Latinos provided their own cultural layers in the 20th century after the Jews (mostly) moved on. Still, it's the neighborhood's Jewish culture that speaks strongest to me â€” more specifically, the Yiddish theater.,Though the people are long gone, ghosts of that vanished world can still be summoned by a stroll through the neighborhood. And for me a walk around the Lower East Side is always a chance to revisit the travels I made as I researched my book â€œStardust Lost: The Triumph, Tragedy and Mishugas of the Yiddish Theaterâ€ù (Knopf, 2006). More than a score of theaters once flourished in the neighborhood, offering everything from Shakespeare to shund â€” the Yiddish word for trash.,Any visitor can stir up those greasepaint ghosts, too, if the neighborhood is walked in the right frame of mind. But first, a bit of history.,Around the turn of the 20th century, millions of Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe for New York. Among the throng were Abraham Goldfaden, who began the Yiddish theater in 1876 in Jassy, Romania, and his followers, including the spirited clown Sigmund Mogolesku, who influenced everyone from Eddie Cantor to Jerry Lewis.,Then there came David Kessler, the Yiddish theater's first naturalistic actor, and Boris Thomashefsky, the quintessential impresario-entertainer, who billed himself as â€œAmerica's Darling.â€ù Then the great Jacob Adler, among the few Jewish actors to have played Shylock up to that time.,These outsize personalities were fierce rivals. As Thomashefsky remembered in his diaries, â€œIf Kessler wore a big hat with a long feather, Adler wore a bigger hat with three feathers and a gold scarf.â€ù,But, Thomashefsky continued, â€œI piled on colored stockings, coats, crowns, swords, shields, bracelets, earrings, turbans. If they rode in on a real horse, I had a golden chariot drawn by two horses. If they killed an enemy, I killed an army.â€ù,Tracing their battles, I had many occasions to walk along Second Avenue, the aorta of the Lower East Side, exploring places that were once as vibrant and tumultuous as Midtown Manhattan. If you, too, plan to walk in the footsteps of the Yiddish theater's giants (and dwarfs), a good place to start is what the ghetto dwellers called Optown â€” the southwest corner of 12th Street and Second Avenue. It was there that the last old-style actor-impresario, Maurice Schwartz, held forth. Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theater closed up shop in the early 1950s, but show business carries on: the site is now a multiplex.,Across the street, the Cafe Royal was the hangout for Yiddish actors in full makeup. Taken there as a child in the 1920s, the late writer Kate Simon recalled in her book â€œBronx Primitiveâ€ù that â€œone famous tragedienne wore a tall, blazing-red turban; another, with heavily kohl-circled eyes, sported a yellowed ermine capelet, her hands buried in its matching Anna Karenina muff.â€ù When the Cafe Royal closed in the 1950s, the place became a dry cleaner. These days, reflecting the Lower East Side's ever-changing character, it's a sushi restaurant.,Stay on the east side of Second Avenue and walk downtown two blocks. There, beneath your feet, are deteriorating brass plaques that commemorate some 50 stars of the Yiddish theater, including Adler, Kessler, Thomashefsky, and crossover celebrities who left the ghetto for Broadway and, even, Hollywood, including Paul Muni, Molly Picon and Fyvush Finkel. The Yiddish Walk of Fame was the inspiration of the late Abe Lebewohl, owner of the late Second Avenue Deli.,Cross Second Avenue and walk east to 31 East Seventh Street. Smack in the middle of the city's old Ukrainian enclave, home of St. Stanislaus Church and shops that sell Easter eggs, there is a red-brick building that once housed the Hebrew Actors Union, one of the most feared guilds in New York. Actors had to audition for membership. â€œThat was a barbaric place,â€ù Mr. Finkel once recalled. â€œThey could literally make you or break you.â€ù Alas, the membership has left the building, which is now a respository of old photographs and files and a regular meeting place where old fans reminisce.,A few blocks south and you're at Second Avenue and Houston Street. Gray stone high-rise buildings now loom at the northeast and southeast corners, once the site of the Yiddish theater's biggest palaces. These were rival houses: Thomashefsky held forth at the National Theater, where he and his wife, Bessie, staged everything from pageants to Shakespeare. Threatened by Thomashefsky's ambition, his personal playwright once declared, â€œI will write you a better play than this â€˜Hamlet'!â€ù,The boss played the troubled Prince of Denmark, anyway, and received tumultuous applause from a naÃ¯ve audience. The ticket-holders called, â€œAuthor! Author!â€ù According to the Thomashefsky memoirs, Bessie explained to the audience that â€œMr. Shekspir lived far away in England and could not come to see his play.â€ù,Across the street, at the Roumanian Opera House, operettas diverted large audiences. The pieces didn't start out that way but somehow there was always room to shoehorn in a song or two, even in â€œKing Lear.â€ù Close by was the Oriental Theater at Grand Street and the Bowery. Each place had its fanatical partisans, true believers who would dress in the manner of their favorite performers and buy tickets to productions across the street so they could razz the actors and playwrights.,WHO were these fans? Untutored but enthusiastic greenhorns, people who knew there was something better than their long sweatshop hours and their cheek-by-jowl neighborhoods. For a glimpse of how they endured and prevailed, pay a call at the ,, housed along a hunched row of buildings on Orchard Street. Only a few blocks from what had been the heart of the Yiddish theater, the museum illustrates how a typical Jewish family lived in respectable poverty, relieved by the knowledge that there would be no Cossacks riding into their lives, no laws forbidding them to attend plays in their own tongue and no one to restrict their religious affiliations.,These days their descendants are largely to be found in the suburbs, but a handful of temples have lasted. Wedged among Chinese restaurants, fish markets and hair salons, the Eldridge Street Synagogue at 12 Eldridge Street, with its ornamental wooden carvings, 70-foot vaulted ceilings and stained-glass windows, is in the middle of an extensive restoration. Nearby, at 280 Broome Street, you can find Kehila Kedosha Janina, the only Greek Romaniote synagogue in the Western Hemisphere.,To complete your walk, take a food break and dig into  the same sort of meals enjoyed by Yiddish theater audiences long ago. The difference is that they ate in the playhouses, savoring their food along with the dialogue. Try Katz's Delicatessen on East Houston Street, which opened in 1888. Or grab a bag of bagels and a side order of lox at the pungent Russ & Daughters, also on East Houston, run by the same family since 1914. While relishing a snack, close your eyes, and you're back in what the late historian Irving Howe called â€œThe World of Our Fathers.â€ù,And even if that world has vanished, you can still see a fascinating remnant a couple of miles to the north. Walk to the West Side subway and take a train to 72nd Street, then stroll to the large stone building at 334 Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street that is home to the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan. There the 92-year-old Folksbiene, the last remaining Yiddish theater in the United States, still thrives.,In a new century, this is where Yiddish theater lives. And why not? The rent is more reasonable, the audiences more sympathetic and the supertitles take care of those who  understand only  English. Fair enough.,As a Yiddish proverb has it: Badarf men hunik ven tsuker iz zis? Who needs honey when sugar is sweet?",STEFAN KANFER,"JAN. 26, 2007","In Lower Manhattan, the Echo of the Yiddish Stage Endures",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/travel/escapes/26yiddish.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Under pressure from the Connecticut attorney general, a consulting group owned by some of the countryâ€™s most influential hospital executives agreed yesterday to stop selling marketing advice to vendors who do millions of dollars in business with nonprofit hospitals across the nation, including their own.,Connecticutâ€™s attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said the group, the Healthcare Research and Development Institute, had undermined competition among hospital suppliers through â€œundue and improper influence.â€ù,Known as H.R.D.I., the group is owned by about three dozen hospital executives, but it is underwritten by 40 or so of its handpicked corporate members who sell drugs, medical devices and financial services to hospitals.,According to a settlement agreement signed by H.R.D.I. and the state attorneys general in Connecticut and Florida, hospital members may no longer accept consulting fees and free trips to resorts from hospital suppliers. The agreement did not include any admission of wrongdoing by H.R.D.I. or its owners.,The agreement, Mr. Blumenthal said, â€œshatters an anticompetitive, secret society, an elite and exclusive club of premier hospital executives and select hospital supply businesses that restrained competition to the detriment of patients and providers.â€ù,The settlement, he said, did not end his investigation of hospital vendors.,H.R.D.I., which was founded five decades ago as an educational group, will change from a profit-making company into a nonprofit group financed only by hospitals or their executives. Supply companies may not initially join the new group, called the Health Education Network, nor will they be permitted to have any financial links to it.,The settlement, under which the group agreed to pay a $150,000 fine, ends a two-year investigation by Mr. Blumenthal, who found that some suppliers had increased their sales at hospitals run by H.R.D.I. members after paying consulting fees to those members, investigators said. The names of those vendors and hospitals were not included in the settlement agreement, which applied only to H.R.D.I. and not individual members.,Based in Pensacola, Fla., H.RD.I. has long maintained that its sole purpose was to improve products and services in health care.,â€œH.R.D.I. never has and does not now buy, sell or encourage the purchase or sale of products or services,â€ù said Diane Appleyard, the groupâ€™s president and chief executive. â€œAfter more than 23 months of investigation, no wrongdoing was found and no charges were filed.â€ù,H.R.D.I.â€™s owners are among the most influential members of the hospital industry. They have included executives of group purchasing organizations, which negotiate millions of dollars in supply contracts on behalf of nonprofit hospitals across the country.,Despite its elite membership, H.R.D.I. has maintained a low public profile. Its meetings were not open to the public or to vendors who were not members. According to H.R.D.I. rules, only two vendors in any product line could belong to the group.,Last summer, The New York Times reported on an H.R.D.I. meeting in May at the Broadmoor, a Colorado Springs resort, where 40 health care companies sought advice from hospital executives. Market leaders like Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup attended, along with many smaller companies.,The companies paid the travel expenses for hospital officials and their spouses and sponsored golf and tennis outings, among other events.,According to the settlement agreement, vendors paid $40,000 annually, mostly for two private consulting sessions a year with hospital officials at resorts like the Broadmoor.,H.R.D.I.â€™s rules prohibited vendors from using its meetings to sell products. In one instance, the group expelled a company for violating that rule. But over all, state investigators said, the rules were either ineffective or not enforced.,Suppliers, for example, lobbied H.R.D.I. employees for consultations with executives at hospitals where they wanted to make sales, Connecticut officials said. One vendor, after consulting with an H.R.D.I. hospital executive, went from zero sales at the executiveâ€™s hospital to $3.6 million in annual sales, investigators said.,â€œVarious vendors identified membership in H.R.D.I. as an important, if not their most important, â€˜relationship builderâ€™ in the health care industry,â€ù the agreement states.,Last year, health care executives received average annual compensation from H.R.D.I. of $20,000 to $25,000, though individual compensation has been high as $50,000.,Under the agreement, HRDIâ€™s successor group, the Health Education Network, may readmit vendors after three years, but only under certain conditions. Hospital executives cannot serve on a vendorâ€™s board or receive more than $2,500 annually for work on behalf of the nonprofit group. The Health Education Network also cannot limit the number of vendors in any particular product line.",WALT BOGDANICH,"JAN. 25, 2007",Conflict Case at Hospitals Is Settled,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/business/25buyer.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Smokers will still be able to light up at Atlantic City casinos if a compromise measure introduced in the City Council last night gets final approval in two weeks.,The Council was supposed to vote last night on an ordinance to ban smoking entirely at casinos, but after casino executives complained that a total ban would make gamblers who smoked travel to other states, several lawmakers came up with a compromise that would allow smoking in 25 percent of the space of a casinoâ€™s gambling floors, restaurants and bars.,Because of the concern about gamblers going to other states to bet, the casinos were exempted from a 2006 state law that prohibits smoking in most public places, including restaurants and bars. Bar and restaurant owners in Atlantic City protested the exemption, saying that smokers would abandon their establishments to eat and drink in casinos. Since the state law allowed Atlantic City itself to ban smoking, several Council members, siding with the restaurant owners, introduced an ordinance in November to ban smoking in casinos as well.,During a 90-minute public comment period at the City Council meeting last night, Joseph A. Corbo Jr., the president of the New Jersey Casino Association, spoke in favor of the compromise ordinance, even though the association had originally opposed any ban on smoking in casinos. The ordinance will come up for a final vote at the next Council meeting, on Feb. 7.,Regina Carlson, executive director of New Jersey GASP, an antismoking group, said she believed that she and others opposed to any smoking in the casinos had been blindsided by the new compromise.,â€œThey say there will be ventilation, but you would have to have a tornado to get all the smoke out,â€ù said Ms. Carlson, who noted that Delaware did not allow smoking in casinos, and that the owners of proposed slot machine parlors in Philadelphia have said they plan to ban smoking.",ROBERT STRAUSS,"JAN. 25, 2007",Smoking Ban at Casinos May Be Eased,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/nyregion/25casino.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bridget Everett is, without a doubt, the life of the party. Whether itâ€™s a party youâ€™d be interested in attending â€” or one youâ€™d instantly flee in search of Xanax â€” depends on your affection for big-boned, loudmouthed, dirty-talking girls with attitudes stretching from here to Kansas.,Ms. Everett in fact comes from Manhattan, Kan., and is probably unknown to even the most avid theatergoer or cabaret fanatic residing in the Manhattan she now calls home. Unless youâ€™ve had a particularly bruising encounter with a bosomy waitress at a certain pan-Asian eatery on the Upper West Side. Or watched in astonishment as hurricane Bridget stormed onto the seedy stage of your favorite karaoke bar and held the place hostage for the next hour.,The brief biographical note in the program for Ms. Everettâ€™s solo show, peculiarly titled â€œAt Least Itâ€™s Pink,â€ù which opened last night at Ars Nova, mentions her upbringing in Kansas, boasts of a degree in vocal performance from Arizona State University (who knew?) and concludes with this unprepossessing sentence: â€œSoon after, she promptly abandoned it all to move to New York, sing karaoke and work as a waitress.â€ù,Those endearingly modest goals accomplished, Ms. Everett has now set her sights a little higher. Somewhere in her perambulations among the cityâ€™s karaoke hot spots, or perhaps while slinging duck and mushroom egg rolls uptown, Ms. Everett encountered a couple of gentlemen who have encouraged and abetted her growing ambition.,The co-authors of her show, a woozy combination of cabaret, stand-up and a particularly volatile episode of â€œThe Jerry Springer Show,â€ù are Michael Patrick King, a writer and director of â€œSex and the Cityâ€ù on HBO (and creator of the cult favorite â€œThe Comebackâ€ù), and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing, relatively sober half of the now-near-legendary downtown club duo Kiki and Herb. All three share general authorship; Mr. King directs; Mr. Mellman and Ms. Everett wrote the songs.,All that fastidious apportioning of credit would seem to suggest that â€œAt Least Itâ€™s Pinkâ€ù is a conscientiously artful, carefully constructed evening of entertainment. This is not exactly the case. Smarts and savvy do eventually reveal themselves to be ingredients in this throat-scorching glass of punch: the last 15 minutes are ingenious. But for much of the 80-minute evening Ms. Everett holds forth at center stage with little regard for coddling the audience with coherent monologue, comforting song or useful insight.,Then again, a performer this bold and brash â€” O.K., frightening â€” doesnâ€™t need such easy props to keep her audience from getting restive. Ms. Everettâ€™s vulgarity and abrasiveness are her selling points, and sell them she does, with all the delicacy of a linebacker. In between generous swigs from a bottle of white wine, she tells bawdy anecdotes and sings raunchy songs, then tells raunchy anecdotes and sings bawdy songs. She wails tales of wayward evenings spent searching for hookups online, of her attraction to black men and their fabled attributes, of her affection for anal sex. Some of this is funny; not much is quotable.,Ms. Everettâ€™s act recalls the sexual insouciance and joyous exhibitionism of early Bette Midler, as does her cultivated rapport with her largely gay audience. But her voice has far less depth and color than Ms. Midlerâ€™s, and in Ms. Everettâ€™s case chutzpah ultimately outstrips talent.,The appeal of her songs is mostly comic, in any case. The glaze of irony that twinkles in most of the material comes from the peculiar discordance between Ms. Everettâ€™s rather friendly, unexceptional looks and her foul mouth. A similar dissonance is reflected in the music-making. While Mr. Mellman is supplying wistful easy-rock melodies at the piano, Ms. Everett is singing of a teenage romance that led to an abortion, in a mock-elegiac tone.,In referring to Ms. Everettâ€™s unexceptional looks I should clarify that I referred only to her face. Ms. Everettâ€™s richly endowed figure is more striking. There is an admirable audacity in her careless flaunting of a body type that cultural attitudes dictate she should disguise in shape-hiding fabric. None of that for big Bridget Everett. In the glare of the solo spotlight, the most demure article of clothing she chooses to wear is a fake-snakeskin bustier.,Of course Ms. Everettâ€™s courageousness in displaying her curves does have its drawbacks. You may well leave â€œAt Least Itâ€™s Pinkâ€ù ruing the day that fishnet was invented, for instance. To say nothing of the thong.,Book by Bridget Everett, Michael Patrick King and Kenny Mellman; original music and lyrics by Mr. Mellman and Ms. Everett; directed by Mr. King; sets by Lauren Helpern; costumes by Angela Wendt; lighting by Tyler Micoleau; sound by Jorge Muelle; associate producer, Kimberly Rosenstock; general manager, Reuben Saunders; production manager, Melissa Zygmant; production stage manager, Alaina Taylor.

"Quite a few languages are spoken in Brian Frielâ€™s play â€œTranslations.â€ù There is a fair amount of Latin and Greek. Gaelic makes frequent appearances. And English is of course the playâ€™s official lingua franca.,But you can leave your Berlitzes and your dead-language primers at home. A basic fluency in the workings of the human heart is all thatâ€™s necessary to absorb the beauties of Mr. Frielâ€™s tender, sad and funny play about the difficulty of finding a home in the world, a person to share it with, and a name to call it by.,â€œTranslationsâ€ù has already had two major New York productions: Off Broadway in 1981 and on Broadway in 1995. Neither made much of a splash (it racked up just 25 performances in the more recent run), but â€œTranslationsâ€ù is anything but a splashy play. A quiet ensemble drama set in rural Ireland in 1833, it explores the troubled lives of a handful of characters struggling to adjust to the shifting dynamics of the world around them, which is undergoing quiet but radical change as the hard fist of British regulation seeks to impose itself on local tradition. Item No. 1 on Britainâ€™s agenda is mapping the island and translating the Gaelic place names into proper English, a process that has complicated political and cultural overtones for the Irish people that resonate to this day.,Mr. Frielâ€™s touch is delicate, his narrative artful but oblique, his lyrical voice steeped in the lusty idioms of rural Ireland. And then thereâ€™s the Greek and Latin, intoned with joyous relish by men who like to chase it with a spot of hard liquor. â€œTranslationsâ€ù is, in short, the kind of play whose merits are likely to be lost in translation when exposed to the bright spotlight of Broadway.,And yet here it is on Broadway again, where it opened last night at the Biltmore Theater, courtesy of the , (which also produced the Off Broadway production) and the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, N.J. On this occasion it has wisely been entrusted to Garry Hynes, the brilliant Irish director known for her work with the fiery young playwright Martin McDonagh and the cycle of plays by J. M. Synge seen at the Lincoln Center Festival last summer. Ms. Hynes has in turn wisely entrusted Mr. Frielâ€™s challenging play to a stageful of little-known but hugely talented actors, creating an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency. In their hands â€” on their tongues, I should say â€” â€œTranslationsâ€ù is nothing short of glorious.,Mind you, the play trades in a subtle glory, the kind that steals upon you furtively and without the help of advance PR. Last season a revival of Mr. Frielâ€™s â€œFaith Healerâ€ù opened on Broadway with rather more Ã©clat, thanks to the high-profile presence of Ralph Fiennes in the title role. Ms. Hynesâ€™s cast boasts no stars of that renown, indeed no stars of the renown of Mr. Fiennesâ€™s estimable co-star, New Yorkâ€™s beloved Cherry Jones. Nor does it involve the kind of tour de force monologues of which â€œFaith Healerâ€ù is composed, long, heart-searing speeches in which the characters seem to shed their skins paragraph by paragraph, until their souls stand naked and exposed before us.,But this news may come as a relief to those who found â€œFaith Healerâ€ù a tough sit. â€œTranslationsâ€ù is ultimately as emotionally resonant as that play is â€” and possibly just as heart-rending â€” but its rich cast of colorful characters, its more pointed humor and its layered narrative make it more accessible. And nobody talks for more than two minutes at a time, which is the blink of an eye for an Irishman onstage.,Why should they? All too often the words they speak cannot be understood by their listeners, even when their lives depend on them. In â€œTranslationsâ€ù Mr. Friel celebrates the sweet music of human speech, but the play also explores the seriocomic truth that language divides as easily as it unites, and sometimes fumbles and stalls just when we need it to soar. Greek or Latin, English or Gaelic, it is the only tool we have to forge emotional bonds, diffuse social conflict and translate inner passions into the practices of daily living. But how paltry it can seem as a medium of expression for all that fills our searching souls!,Its eloquence and its limits are most movingly illustrated at the climax of the first act, when love comes upon two of the playâ€™s central characters with the speed of a runaway horse. The Irish dairymaid Maire (Susan Lynch) has long been betrothed to a local, but she yearns to escape the stultifying culture of Ballybeg (the fictional town where many of Mr. Frielâ€™s plays are set, here also known in Gaelic as Baile-Beag). Maire has recently announced a bold plan to move to America, but her eye has been caught by Lieutenant Yolland (,), the British soldier with no fixed place in the world who feels strangely at home among the wary but friendly locals. He has fallen in love with the land, the people and, poignantly, the language it is his job to make obsolete.,He speaks scarcely a word of Gaelic, and her English is limited to a few phrases and a useless bit of nonsense, courtesy of Aunt Mary: â€œIn Norfolk we besport ourselves around the maypole.â€ù As they each trot out their stray bits of each otherâ€™s language, Mr. Williams and Ms. Lynch â€” who both give enchanting performances â€” make palpably clear the anguish and frustration of being unable to find even rough words to communicate inchoate feelings. As funny as it is touching, this beautifully played scene exposes the truth and the lie in the clichÃ© that lovers need no common language to lay bare their hearts.,But almost everything in this production plays beautifully. The boozy give and take between Hugh (Niall Buggy), the schoolmaster who runs the humble rural schoolroom where the play takes place, and his prized old pupil Jimmy Jack (Dermot Crowley), is wonderfully funny, as they tease each other with etymological tests.,The mixture of tension and affection between Hughâ€™s sons is intimated with subtle force. Manus (David Costabile), an ardent nationalist, takes over the teaching chores when Hugh has taken a nip too much, at least until his heart is broken and he comes to feel an exile in his beloved home. Owen (Alan Cox) ran away to Dublin and has returned to Ballybeg as the hired assistant to the British soldiers in their mission, which he believes can help advance the cause of the locals, if they can be made to see it. (Now if only he could get his employers to call him by his right name, and not by the Anglicized Rowan.),Mr. Frielâ€™s characters are too complexly drawn â€” and in this production played â€” to line up neatly for or against the advent of a new language that may bring economic benefits but will speed the erosion of an entire culture. Hugh, that lover of dead tongues, makes the eloquent observation that words â€œare not immortal,â€ù and â€œa civilization can be imprisoned in a linguistic contour which no longer matches the landscape of ... fact.â€ù  The mournful corollary Mr. Frielâ€™s play gently illuminates: People are far more mortal than the words they use, and a changing civilization may leave them adrift and alone.,You donâ€™t have to search hard for lamentable contemporary resonance in â€œTranslations.â€ù The attempt to impose a new civilization on a subjugated country by force looms as the background for the smaller personal dramas that take up much of the casually drawn narrative. And the plot turns on the disappearance of a soldier, possibly a casualty of Irish resentment of the occupying force.,But the quiet urgency of Ms. Hynesâ€™s production derives more from the limning of the small strains tugging at the tight fabric of a community of individuals, each bedeviled by a private struggle. The ensemble is rounded out by Michael Fitzgerald as the impish young Doalty, who bridles more than most at the presence of the British; Geraldine Hughes as the feisty Bridget; Graeme Malcolm as the stern, condescending redcoat Captain Lancey; and Morgan Hallett as Sarah, a disturbed young woman who has trouble communicating at all, and can barely say her name.,Ms. Hynesâ€™s production also benefits from evocative work from some of her regular collaborators, the set and costume designer Francis Oâ€™Connor and the lighting designer Davy Cunningham. Mr. Cunninghamâ€™s painterly lighting is particularly integral to the nuanced contouring of the production. As the narrative darkens in the last act, the triangle of light that formed a bright spot in the dimness of the barn is shut out, as hope for a promising end to almost everyoneâ€™s trouble begins to dim.,A despondent and tipsy Jimmy Jack and Hugh are alone in the dusk when Maire enters and asks, â€œMaster, what does the English word â€˜alwaysâ€™ mean?â€ù,He gives her the answer in Latin, but adds: â€œItâ€™s not a word Iâ€™d start with. Itâ€™s a silly word, girl.â€ù,In fact, in the darkening gloom of the barn, in the final moments of Mr. Frielâ€™s haunting but hugely rewarding play, it sounds like the saddest word in the English language.

"Lisa Perry loves ,.,So much so that two large portrait photographs of the senator by Chuck Close grace the hallway of her 1960s-themed penthouse apartment on Sutton Place in Manhattan.,â€œItâ€™s a beautiful picture because Hillary is beautiful,â€ù said Ms. Perry, a top Democratic fund-raiser, whose husband, Richard, runs a prominent $12 billion hedge fund. â€œI will be there for her emotionally, and I will raise.â€ù,There are no Pop Art portraits of , in the home of Paul E. Singer, a longtime hedge fund executive and a primary fund-raiser and policy adviser to Mr. Giuliani, but his support is no less ardent.,â€œRudy Giuliani is the right leader for the times,â€ù Mr. Singer said.,Hedge fund money, which now exceeds $1 trillion, has emerged in the last several years as a potentially powerful force in politics, as underscored by the significant role it is playing in the presidential aspirations of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani. During the 2006 election cycle, executives who work at the 30 biggest hedge funds made $2.8 million in  contributions to political candidates or party committees, almost double the amount in 2000.,Yet it is not just the money they donate directly that makes people in hedge funds attractive to campaigns. They also offer access to other potential donors  in the financial world, which in recent election cycles has become one of the biggest sources of political contributions. That pipeline has made it easy for well-connected candidates like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Giuliani and Senator John McCain to consider forgoing public funding. (Mrs. Clinton has done so; Mr. McCain is expected to opt out; and Mr. Giuliani has not yet addressed the topic.),And top candidates for the 2008 campaign are expected to raise a lot of money quickly â€” at least $100 million each by the end of this year by some estimates.,â€œAre hedge fund guys going to be happy with their art collections and their houses in Greenwich or are they going to take the next step?â€ù said Byron R. Wien, the investment strategist at Pequot Capital. â€œAs Hollywood once invaded politics, you will see the same with hedge funds.â€ù,Money from Wall Street has long been a factor in Washington and has tended to flow, with a policy agenda, to the ascendant political party. Giving by people in hedge funds, on the other hand, tends to be more personal and ideological. Some of the most aggressive donors have been Democratic supporters like George Soros, David E. Shaw of D. E. Shaw and James H. Simons at Renaissance Technologies, as well as younger executives like Thomas F. Steyer at Farallon and Marc Lasry at Avenue Capital, all of whom gave generously during the 2006 election cycle.,While hedge fund money appears to be tilting toward Democrats of late, Republican donors like Julian H. Robertson Jr., the founder of Tiger Management, who has given more than $700,000 over the last three cycles, and Bruce Kovner at Caxton Associates have backed their partyâ€™s candidates and causes.,Still, compared with the billions of dollars that hedge fund magnates have spent on art, mansions and other extravagances, these political donations are a pittance, held in check by federal finance laws that limit personal contributions to $2,100 and by a general reluctance to step into the public limelight.,But with the rapid growth of their money  and stature, an increasing number of the hedge fund wealthy are not just putting their money to work, they are forging personal and professional ties with a generation of politicians who have come to spend as much time raising money as they do drafting legislation.,The courtship has been slow.,After all, the essence of the industryâ€™s success has been its unregulated status and secrecy, so hedge fund titans must weigh the thrill of proximity to political power with the increased public scrutiny that inevitably follows.,The connections can take different shapes and forms. For John Edwards, the Democratic presidential candidate, the 14 months he spent as a paid senior adviser at Fortress Investment, a $29.7 billion hedge fund and private equity firm, helped him to bond with the fundâ€™s liberal-leaning executives, several of whom have given money to Mr. Edwards.,As to what Mr. Edwards, a trial lawyer with no previous financial markets experience, did at Fortress, an adviser to the candidate said that Mr. Edwards â€œadvised on where there might be investment opportunities and where he saw the global economy going.â€ù Mr. Edwards resigned from Fortress last month before declaring his candidacy.,And Avenue Capital, a $12 billion fund run by Mr. Lasry, a prominent financial supporter of the Clintons, hired their daughter, Chelsea, last year.,Mr. Singer and Ms. Perry represent different sides of the same coin. Mr. Singer, 62, is the founding partner of Elliott Associates, a $7 billion hedge fund with a conservative, risk-averse bias that has been in business since 1977, making it one of the oldest funds around. A reserved, private man who would answer questions only via e-mail, Mr. Singer is a self-described conservative libertarian who has given millions of dollars to Republican organizations that emphasize a strong military and support Israel.,They include Progress for America ($1.5 million in contributions), a political advocacy group set up to advance the policies of the Bush administration; Swift Vets and P.O.W.â€™s for Truth; and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, which includes Vice President Dick Cheney and Richard N. Perle, an adviser to the former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, among its past and current advisory directors.,Mr. Singer said that his support for Mr. Giuliani sprang from an appreciation of Mr. Giulianiâ€™s work as mayor. â€œRudyâ€™s stewardship is primarily responsible for making New York one of the greatest cities of the world,â€ù he said.,A trustee at the Manhattan Institute, the conservative policy group that has been a source of many of Mr. Giulianiâ€™s core policies, like welfare reform and a focus on quality-of-life issues, Mr. Singer sees Mr. Giuliani as the â€œstrongest, most conservative candidate in the race.â€ù,While Kenneth G. Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, held Mr. Giulianiâ€™s first public fund-raiser last month, a campaign strategy notebook that was leaked to The Daily News of New York this month pointed to Mr. Singer as the locus of Mr. Giulianiâ€™s fund-raising network. â€œI will be raising money for Rudy in professional and personal circles,â€ù he said.,Asked to describe his political philosophy, Mr. Singer says his conservatism dates back to Barry Goldwater and is founded on free enterprise and a belief that the government should â€œnot be taking from one person and giving to another.â€ù He abhors what he calls social engineering and he has financially supported state propositions that advocate preventing state agencies from collecting racial information.,He believes in the doctrine of American exceptionalism and is wary about United States involvement in â€œinternational organizations and alliances.â€ù As for the war in Iraq, he said, â€œAmerica finds itself at an early stage of a drawn-out existential struggle with radical strains of pan-national Islamists.â€ù,In an industry known for its secrecy, Mr. Singer keeps a particularly low profile. He does all that he can to keep his picture from appearing in the media and does virtually no marketing for his fund, which had a return of 17 percent last year. Given his wealth, his disposition is frugal.,â€œHe is not a trophy collector,â€ù said Lawrence Simon, the co-founder of Ivy Asset Management and an investor with Mr. Singer for more than 25 years. â€œI donâ€™t even know if he has a second abode. He is very quiet in the way that he carries himself.â€ù,A graduate of the University of Rochester and Harvard Law School, Mr. Singer practiced law before he began to dabble in what was then an obscure investment strategy called convertible arbitrage. By buying convertible bonds and selling the attached stock short â€” or betting that its price would fall â€” he realized that he could achieve a decent investment return in up and down markets.,Steeled by the bear markets of the 1970s, he worries that managers may have become punch-drunk from a surfeit of happy investment times. â€œI am struck by the size of the hedge fund community and the amount of money being managed by people who have little experience in risk management and adverse market environments,â€ù he said.,In contrast to Mr. Singerâ€™s quiet approach, Ms. Perryâ€™s embrace of Mrs. Clinton has taken on a more celebratory cast. She has tapped New Yorkâ€™s art world for fund-raising parties and opened up her Long Island house, in Sag Harbor, for gatherings for the senator.,Over the last three election cycles, Ms. Perry,  48, has given more than $1 million to Democrats, putting her in the most elite tier of Democratic donors. Given that she wrote her first check in 1998, when she was a stay-at-home mother, it has been a rapid evolution and one that has been fueled by her belief that there are not enough women senators in Washington. Her litmus issue is a womanâ€™s right to an , and it is what first attracted her to Mrs. Clinton in 1999.,Now she considers her a personal friend. â€œWe have a strong bond,â€ù she said. â€œShe is the smartest, the most worldly. I just think she would be the most fabulous president.â€ù,She admits to getting a bit emotional at the thought of a woman in the White House. â€œI feel it so strongly,â€ù said Ms. Perry, who is in the midst of starting her own line of Lisa Perry-branded clothing. â€œIâ€™m a strong feminist so I really want it to happen.â€ù,Mrs. Clintonâ€™s advisers are quick to give Ms. Perry her due.,â€œLisa is an active, effective supporter,â€ù said Alan J. Patricof, the finance chairman of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s two Senate campaigns. â€œShe is not a frivolous person.â€ù,While her husband, Richard, is also a Democrat, Ms. Perry points out that her giving and fund-raising are driven by her own politics, not his. Still, he, too, is a supporter of Mrs. Clinton.,â€œHe thinks she is one of the smartest people he has ever met,â€ù Ms. Perry said.,But it is her own largess that gives her a sense of pride. â€œNot a lot of women write their own checks,â€ù she said.",LANDON THOMAS Jr.,"JAN. 25, 2007","Hedge Fund Chiefs, With Cash,  Join Political Fray",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/business/25hedge.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 â€” As many as four big states â€” California, Florida, Illinois and New Jersey â€” are likely to move up their 2008 presidential primaries to early next February, further upending an already unsettled nominating process and forcing candidates of both parties to rethink their campaign strategies, party officials said Wednesday.,The changes, which seem all but certain to be enacted by state legislatures, mean that the presidential candidates face the prospect of going immediately from an ordered series of early contests in relatively small states in January to a single-day, coast-to-coast battlefield in February, encompassing some of the most expensive advertising markets in the nation.,The changes would appear to benefit well-financed and already familiar candidates and diminish the prospects of those with less money and name recognition going into such a highly compressed series of contests early next year.,Associates of Senator ,, the New York Democrat, and Senator ,, the Arizona Republican, said that should either of them stumble early on, the respective party primaries in California and New Jersey â€” two states that would seem particularly hospitable to them â€” could offer an expensive but welcome firewall.,But at the same time, states like New Jersey and California could provide an opening for ,, the former mayor of New York, who faces the daunting prospect of overcoming resistance among social conservatives in the Republican contests in Iowa and South Carolina in January.,And several party analysts suggested that having such delegate-rich states at stake on Feb. 5 could persuade candidates who might otherwise step out after a defeat in Iowa or New Hampshire to press on in hopes of a dramatic recovery on the new Super Tuesday.,â€œI think this is huge,â€ù said John Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. â€œAnd the unintended consequences could be even bigger.â€ù,While officials in both parties are wary of the changes, final say over the calendar rests with the states. Advisers to Republican and Democratic presidential candidates say they have come to view substantial changes as inevitable and they have begun to plan accordingly.,â€œWe donâ€™t set the calendar, and we donâ€™t control the calendar, but we are going to compete aggressively in all these states,â€ù said Patti Solis Doyle, who is the manager of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s exploratory presidential effort. â€œAnd I will also tell you we have the resources and the organization to compete in all those states.â€ù,The developments mark the latest upheaval in a political calendar already in disarray. The Democratic Party voted last year to allow Nevada and South Carolina to move their nominating contests into the narrow period at the beginning of the process that once was confined to just Iowaâ€™s caucus and New Hampshireâ€™s primary.,But New Hampshire officials, protective of their first-in-the-nation primary status, have responded by saying they will schedule their primary as early as it takes, even before Jan. 1, to protect its traditional role. And no one seems to know where the scramble for influence among the states will end.,â€œThis is completely out of control,â€ù said William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of state. He is the leader of a National Association of Secretaries of State committee that is monitoring this movement and trying to push back against it.,â€œThe issue has been bad,â€ù Mr. Galvin said. â€œBut itâ€™s never been as bad as it has been this year. In New Hampshire, they are going to be singing Christmas carols and voting.â€ù,The developments suggest that the national parties are losing any control they have had over the calendar by which they will nominate presidential candidates in 2008. California, New Jersey, Florida and Illinois are most likely to move their primaries early, probably to Feb. 5, joining at least five smaller states that had already scheduled primaries for that day. Illinois lawmakers are talking about moving their primary to help Senator Barack Obama, a Democratic contender; if history is any guide, it is possible that the other candidates might decline to compete in the home state of one of their rivals.,But final votes have not been taken, and state officials said it was possible they could end up going even earlier. Florida in particular has talked about holding its primary seven days after New Hampshireâ€™s, at the risk of sanctions from the Democratic National Committee. And officials said that other states, viewing this surge to the front of the pack, could join in as well.,The Democratic National Committee had adopted a new calendar last year, reducing the once dominant influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, after years of consideration. The Republican Party has so far deferred to Democrats on the changes, waiting to see the outcome of the back-and-forth.,Democrats and Republicans said that the changes would be the latest step in the evolution of a presidential nominating system that increasingly seems resistant to the kind of dark-horse presidential bid that was possible back when small states like Iowa and New Hampshire enjoyed such influence over the nominating process.,It has sowed unease and confusion among campaign staff members as they have tried to measure its implications, and has prompted them to begin making moves now to  prepare for a whole different nominating system. While conventional wisdom is that the best-known candidates would benefit, views about how the shift might play out vary among strategists.,Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant who was a senior adviser to Democratic presidential candidates in 2004 and 2000, said the calendar changes, combined with the presence on the Democratic side of three strong and well-financed candidates â€” Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton and, probably, John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator â€” could mean that the battle for the nomination drags on for months.,â€œI think thereâ€™s a very good chance that we are going to be sitting here at the end of next March saying, â€˜How are people going to put together a majority of delegates with 80 percent of the delegates gone?â€™ â€ù he said. â€œThe nominating process in 2008 is not a little different. Itâ€™s fundamentally different.â€ù,And the campaigns are adjusting accordingly. ,Mr. McCain recently hired Steve Schmidt, a former Bush campaign operative who managed the re-election bid of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the California Republican, in no small part because of what he saw as Mr. Schmidtâ€™s command of California politics.,Similarly, Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has turned his attention to Florida, where he sees a strong prospect of knocking out Mr. McCain by appealing to social conservatives, and installed a campaign team that includes two top political advisers to former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. He is about to announce the hiring of more than six top aides in Florida.,Last weekend, Mr. Romney went to New Jersey, where his aides also think he could make a strong appeal.,â€œThe focus of our efforts publicly have been in Iowa, South Carolina, Michigan, New Hampshire,â€ù said Kevin Madden, Mr. Romneyâ€™s press secretary. â€œBut we are very well organized in Florida.â€ù,In the case of Florida, Democrats and Republicans have welcomed the prospect of having to spend heavily on an early primary because that could prove an early investment for the general campaign, as well, considering how competitive that state is. That is not the case in California or New Jersey, two expensive states that have been solidly Democratic in recent presidential races.,And some Democrats disputed the notion that a California victory could help someone recover from a poor showing in the early states. Nick Baldick, a senior adviser to Mr. Edwards, noted that Howard Dean spent heavily in states that held their primaries after New Hampshire and Iowa and never recovered.,â€œAll that mattered was momentum and winning in Iowa,â€ù Mr. Baldick said Wednesday. â€œI would argue that more states on Feb. 5 makes that exponentially more true. That if you donâ€™t have momentum going into states like those four big states, then forget it and just go home.â€ù",ADAM NAGOURNEY,"JAN. 25, 2007",Big Statesâ€™ Push for Earlier Vote Scrambles Race,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/us/politics/25vote.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PUERTO RICO is a lush island, 100 by 35 miles, outlined by long stretches of white beach, which, for most tourists, are reason enough to visit. But on a recent trip with my husband and three children, I was struck by how much the island offers in addition to its coastline. As we discovered an array of historical sights and opportunities for natural adventures, I quickly concluded that giving up my beach chaise â€” at least part of the time â€” was a smart move.,Driving around the island gives visitors a taste of Puerto Rico's exotic beauty, while a visit to Old San Juan reveals how thoroughly the island is steeped in history. Now a cross of Hispanic and Anglo cultures, Puerto Rico was visited in 1493 by Christopher Columbus. Under the leadership of Juan Ponce de LeÃ_n, the island became a strategic military outpost for Spain, and with its massive forts built in the early 1500s â€” and still standing (and a favorite tourist stop) â€” the island protected its port of , from attacks by the English and Dutch.,As part of the Spanish empire, Puerto Rico thrived during the 1800s. After the Spanish-American War in 1898, Puerto Rico became a part of the United States (which also makes it one of the few Caribbean destinations that Americans can still visit without a passport).,A walk through Old San Juan should include a visit to , (Calle Norzagaray, 787-729-6777), a fortress built by Spanish colonists on a promontory 140 feet above the sea. Kids love to touch the fort's cannons and explore the maze of dungeons, towers and tunnels. A green esplanade just outside the fort â€” perfect for kite flying â€” separates it from the historic town it was built to safeguard.,Where El Morro guarded against attacks from the sea,  , (Calle Norzagaray, 787-729-6960), a fort one mile to the east, was built to stave off land attacks. Finished in 1790 and covering 27 acres, the fort offers spectacular views and a chance to walk on the ramparts. Both forts are managed by the National Park Service (,) and are Unesco world heritage sites. Admission is $3 to visit one fort; $5 for both. Children 15 and younger are free.,The children's museum, , (150 Calle Cristo, 787-722-3791; ,), into which I dragged my reluctant 13-year-old, turned out to be an entertaining stop for both of us. Its three floors are filled with interactive learning activities, art projects, a mock plaza with a food market, puppet shows and special events â€” while there, we made juggling balls out of balloons and rice. The museum, which also has a rooftop garden, is closed on Monday; admission is $5; $4 for children under 12.,A 40-minute drive from San Juan puts you  in the Caribbean National Forest, known locally as El Yunque (Route 191, 787-888-1880; ,), the only tropical rain forest in the United States National Forest Service system and where more than 250 inches of rain falls each year. On 28,000 lush acres, you can view birds, like the endangered Puerto Rican parrot, and hundreds of species of trees and plants. Be sure to listen for the song of the coquÃ_, a tiny tree frog native to the island, which you won't see but will most likely hear. The Big Tree Trail, 1.4 miles round trip, takes  you to La Mina waterfall where â€” if you don't get wet from a rainfall â€” you can cool off. Before you start exploring, make a stop at the El Portal visitors center (open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), where there are multimedia displays and several hands-on activities for youngsters.,The Rio Camuy Cave Park (Route 129, kilometer 18.9, 787-898-3100), a 90-minute drive west of San Juan, is a big  cave system, formed by the Camuy River, one of the world's longest underground rivers. From the  visitors center (admission is $12; $7 ages 4 to 12),  you can take an open-air trolley down to the caves through a 200-foot deep sinkhole, a chasm where sunlight reaches down to  thriving tropical trees and flowers. There are many caves in this 268-acre ecosystem, with winding footpaths and â€œroomsâ€ù with stalactites, stalagmites and huge limestone formations. Keep an eye out for the bats.,For a different type of eco-adventure, try a nighttime boat or kayak ride on a â€œbio bay.â€ù About an hour and a half drive from San Juan, the bioluminescent lagoon at Las Cabezas Nature Reserve in Fajardo (Route 987 near Las Croabas; 787-722-5882)is lighted by millions of microscopic organisms called dinoflagellates. Adults ($7) and older kids ($4 ages 5 to 11) may like getting close to the water in a kayak, and there are boats for those with younger children. Admission is by reservation only; guided tours are recommended.,You can reach all of the above destinations by renting a car, and most hotels offer group tours. Or, you can hire a private guide, which is more costly but allows for greater flexibility. The guide we used, Tony Sanchez, used to work for the ,Fish and Wildlife Service, and was very knowledgeable about the island's flora and fauna (Island Tours, 787-240-6818 ).,On a hot day, there's nothing like a Phish Food ice cream cone from Ben & Jerry's (61 Calle Cristo, Old San Juan; 787-977-6882). On Saturdays from 3 to 5 p.m., children are invited for a story â€œhourâ€ù (with music) â€” part in English and part in Spanish. While the kids are entranced and licking their cones, parents can check e-mail on one of the parlor's two computers ($3 for 15 minutes; $5 for 30 minutes).,Skip the outlets (yes, Ralph Lauren, Coach and the like are here) and stop in to see the colorful crafts at the family-owned Mi PequeÃ±o San Juan (107 Calle Cristo, 787-977-1636; ,). Peruse the variety of handmade miniature reproductions â€” all one-of-a-kind replicas of doors, houses and buildings in Old San Juan.,At the end of Calle Cristo, make a stop to feed the pigeons at the Parque de las Palomas. Constructed during the 18th century and originally a rampart for cannon emplacement, the park got its name from the hundreds of pigeons that lived here, and still do. There is a kiosk there where  one dollar buys a bag of seed. You can watch the pigeons, and kids, run wild.,For a casual, family-run place in Old San Juan with good local food â€”mofongo, or mashed plantain, is a Puerto Rican specialty but children will probably prefer the sugary plantain version â€” try El Jibarito (280 Calle Sol, Old San Juan, 787-725-8375; ,), where you can expect to pay about $30 for two for dinner.,At , (1 Santa Ana Street, Ocean Park, 787-726-5010; ,), diners sit indoors or at tables on the beach, steps  from the ocean. The chef, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, grills traditional dishes from Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands. The menu might include jalapeÃ±o- and ginger-sautÃ©ed shrimp for $26, and guajillo-pepper-rubbed roasted chicken for $22. Restaurant Barrachina (104 Fortaleza Street, Old San Juan, 787-721-5852; ,) claims to be the birthplace of the piÃ±a colada, and the bartender is happy to make them without alcohol ($4.85 virgin; $6.39 with rum). The food isn't much to rave about, but there is a children's menu with standard fare (miniburgers  and chicken fingers cost $5.95 each, with fries and a soda). You can sit  in the interior courtyard where there are two large talking parrots in a cage nearby, or inside where there is a flamenco show on Friday and Saturday nights from 8 to 9 p.m.,A few minutes from the international airport, the , (6961 Avenue of the Governors, 787-253-1700; ,) is on eight oceanfront acres in the Isla Verde neighborhood. Children are happy in the Ritz Kids program, and adults might be happy with two outposts of New York restaurants: Laurent Tourandel has opened a BLT Steak, and the hotel also has a branch of Il Mulino Italian restaurant. Rates for a double room start at $489.,For those who want to stay in the old city, , (100 Calle Cristo; 800-468-2779; ,) is a good choice. Once a Carmelite convent, the 350-year-old building, in the middle of Old San Juan, has been transformed into a luxurious boutique hotel with 70 rooms and a small plunge pool. Double rooms start at $365 a night.,On the northeastern tip of the island, perched on a cliff overlooking the Atlantic, the El Conquistador Resort (1000 El Conquistador Avenue; 800-468-5228; ,) has over 900 rooms and looks like a small city with fountain-filled plazas and cobblestone streets connecting its villas. The hotel has a Golden Door Spa and an Arthur Hills golf course, and its beach is on a private island just off shore, reached by a  shuttle boat. Rates start at $239 for a double.,For a charming â€” and affordable â€” place to stay, try the Numero Uno Guest House (1 Santa Ana Street; 866-726-5010; www.numero1guesthouse.com), site of the child-friendly Pamela's restaurant. Situated on the beach in the Ocean Park neighborhood, just a 15-minute drive from Old San Juan, the hotel was built as a private home in the late 1940s and now how has 14 guest rooms, starting at $115.",CAREN OSTEN GERSZBERG,"JAN. 26, 2007","Old San Juan, for the Young",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/travel/escapes/26kids.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The National Football League and its players union said yesterday that they had agreed to strengthen the leagueâ€™s testing program for performance-enhancing drugs, including increasing the number of tests and adding endurance-boosting EPO to the list of banned substances.,The new policy also adds financial penalties, with players who are suspended for drug use forfeiting part of their signing bonuses. Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the National Football League Players Association, said in an interview that as soon as next season, players who tested positive could also be barred from consideration for postseason awards. Such recognition became an issue during the regular season that ended last month when Shawne Merriman, a San Diego Chargers linebacker, was suspended for four games after a positive steroids test, but was named to the Pro Bowl.,The N.F.L. is considered to have the most stringent testing policy among the major American sports leagues. But loopholes in its program drew increasing scrutiny after The Charlotte Observer reported last summer that Carolina Panthers players had received prescriptions for steroids  â€”  including two players just days before the team played in the 2004 Super Bowl  â€”  yet none tested positive during that time period. The league and the union had been negotiating since September to strengthen the policy.,â€œThese latest improvements will help ensure that we continue to have a strong and effective program,â€ù Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, said in a statement. â€œAs we have done in the past, we will review and modify the policy on an ongoing basis.â€ù,Under the policy changes announced yesterday, the number of players randomly tested each week during the preseason, regular season and postseason would increase to 10 from 7 per team. Last year, the N.F.L. increased the maximum number of times a player could be tested in the off-season to six times from two. Combined, those changes should amount to more than 12,000 drug tests administered to about 1,800 players next season, an increase of about 2,000 tests. Upshaw said that off-season testing would begin more quickly after the end of the regular season. That testing used to start in late March but will now begin in February to decrease the time period when players are not subjected to random testing.,The N.F.L. policy already mandates a four-game suspension for a first offense and an eight-game suspension for a second, penalties that will remain in effect.,But the league will use the sophisticated carbon isotope test with greater frequency, it said. The use of that test has been limited in most drug-testing programs by its high price. It was previously used by the N.F.L. only to confirm positive tests. Now, the league will use it randomly on all samples. The test examines the atomic makeup of testosterone in the urine and can determine if it is natural or synthetic. It is the same test that found synthetic testosterone in a urine sample from Floyd Landis after his victory last summer in the Tour de France.,The N.F.L.â€™s decision to include EPO on its banned list adds a substance more common to cycling and long-distance running. EPO, or erythropoietin, is a synthetic hormone used to improve stamina by increasing the bodyâ€™s production of oxygen-rich red blood cells. No other professional sports league in the United States tests regularly for EPO.,The policy changes were praised yesterday by Dr. Gary I. Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New York University who is a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency. But Wadler said in a telephone interview that the league still needed to include testing for human growth hormone, or HGH.,There is no reliable test for HGH. The N.F.L.,  pledged  a minimum of $500,000 for the development of an HGH test yesterday. Wadler said that amount is a fraction of the millions of dollars the antidoping agency spent on research each year. Wadler said the league should have a provision in its collective-bargaining agreement that allowed for blood samples to be collected and frozen until a reliable drug test came to fruition. Blood collection, he  said, would at least provide a deterrent to the use of HGH until a test was developed.,â€œThey should at least have paved the way by saying that blood testing is an acceptable means of obtaining bodily fluid specimens,â€ù Wadler said.   â€œTheyâ€™ve made some moves in the right direction, but I donâ€™t think we should be in a position of incrementalism.â€ù,Upshaw remains adamant that blood testing is not open for discussion because there is no reliable HGH test. â€œIâ€™m still not willing to have our players stuck like a pin cushion,â€ù Upshaw said. â€œWhat use would it be for you to find something out two or three years from now and weâ€™ve already played games? We have 25 percent turnover each year. What good is that? Itâ€™s almost like changing the speed-limit sign after youâ€™ve passed.â€ù",JUDY BATTISTA,"JAN. 25, 2007",N.F.L. and Union to Strengthen Steroid Testing,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/sports/football/25steroids.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FEW souls roamed the normally busy byways of Ossipee, N.H., earlier this month, as 65-degree temperatures and a complete lack of snow beset this mountainous, lake-rich territory near the , border. A tiny group of young snowboarders in T-shirts rode the sole lift running at the King Pine Ski Area in nearby East Madison. But Main Street in Center Ossipee was empty, and Ossipee Lake itself seemed uncertain whether to keep its scrim of ice.,Winter has been gentle in Ossipee, but now the cold and snow have returned, bringing back the four-season ambience that attracts owners of second homes from ,, ,, , and beyond. Residents say that Ossipee, just east of the much larger and busier Lake Winnipesaukee,  offers a quieter, less expensive alternative to nearby lakes, where $1 million waterfront homes are often the bottom of the market, not the top.,â€œItâ€™s a different mentality from those people who want that â€˜look at meâ€™ approach over on the big lake,â€ù said Clint Peterson,  who in 2003 bought a house overlooking Ossipee Lake with his wife, Kim Avilez, after owning a town house on Lake Winnipesaukee for four years. The Petersons, who shuttle between a home in Palm Desert, Calif., and ,, found their new house, a renovated  $220,000 cottage, in a community called the Bluffs. It is larger than their previous vacation home, which they sold for $210,000.,â€œI got far more than I ever bargained for,â€ù Mr. Peterson said, â€œand I wouldnâ€™t even go back to the big lake, not a chance.â€ù,More people are joining him, many over 55 who stay in Ossipee for more than half the year, spending the rest in  warmer climates. Few people rent out their second homes in Ossipee, preferring to use them year-round. They  play down a rural area that lacks most of the candle shops and cheese emporiums of tonier vacation towns.,Then there is the lake, mostly quiet and tucked within a collection of low-rise, pine-covered mountains. â€œThereâ€™s a view there that reminds me of ,, a smaller version,â€ù said Tina Sylvia, a retired newspaper advertising sales representative  who bought a new house on one of Ossipee Lakeâ€™s back bays in 2003 for $600,000. She,  her husband and their two sons make the three-hour drive from South Dartmouth, Mass., most weekends.,â€œWithin an hourâ€™s drive, you have so many different things you can do or places you can go,â€ù she said.,Ossipee Lake is where pontoon boats drop anchor at sandbars in summer for daylong idylls, where the occasional wetsuited resident on a Wave Runner will navigate the narrow waterway that leads to the lakeâ€™s back bays and go exploring. Crowds  gather occasionally at a small beach off Long Sands Road, where on the Fourth of July fireworks set off in nearby towns can be seen and heard. The population swells in the summer, with second-home owners making up more than half the stock of local property holders.,Ossipee is made up of a few different town centers, including West Ossipee, Ossipee, Ossipee Corners and Center Ossipee, generally regarded as the areaâ€™s downtown. There, on Main Street, a half-mile stretch holding a post office, an elementary school, the Town Hall and a grouping of proud but worn houses with front porches, local residents and vacationers alike say hello, pick up staples at the Pb & J Village Store and stop in at the Iron Kettle for breakfast. This is small-town New Hampshire, and there is nearly nothing that appears to cater to tourists. It has the classic attitude of a Granite State lake town: A place to get away to is just a place to get away to.,Few other businesses occupy the strip, though a revitalization movement is afoot. The Ossipee Main Street Program is working to improve the area; it recently bought three vacant lots in the middle of town, which will become a  park, said Sarah Millette, the programâ€™s director. A bandstand gazebo is planned, and in good weather dozens  gather  Sunday nights in front of the Town Hall to hear bluegrass music and fiddle tunes. Hearty and inexpensive meals can be found up and down Route 16 at places like the Yankee Smokehouse, known for its ribs, and Lazy Susanâ€™s, a breakfast joint.,In winter, snowboarders, snowmobilers and downhill and cross-country skiers take over, navigating the slopes at King Pine or heading up to face off with the surplus of black-diamond routes at Cranmore in North Conway, about 30 miles north.,Despite Ossipeeâ€™s sleepy appearance, there is never a lack of things to do. Thereâ€™s sailing and Jet-Skiing on the lake, hiking in the mountains, fishing in nearby ponds, shooting for par at Indian Mound Golf Club next to the lake and, in the case of Mr. Peterson, motorcycling along rolling two-lane highways. â€œMotorcycling in New Hampshire is second to nowhere,â€ù Mr. Peterson said. â€œThere are a lot of beautiful two-lane blacktop roads that roll through the lakes and the forest.â€ù,Refreshing for many, including those escaping what can be the arcade-like atmosphere of other nearby vacation towns, is Ossipeeâ€™s distinct lack of pretension. Even the  antiques stores seem  intended solely for local residents.,That same low-key feel, however, may turn off some visitors. In addition to local shopping, dining rarely veers toward the high end; at one of the regionâ€™s more expensive restaurants, the Pine River Steak House (11 miles down Route 16 in North Wakefield), the vinyl booths sport the occasional rip and the cheese at the salad bar is wrapped in plastic and set out in a block for customers to cut. (It was hard to find a meal exceeding $20 a person.),Few supermarkets other than a Hannafordâ€™s on Route 16 dot the map, though a Rite-Aid drugstore is nearby. Even so, driving up and down Route 16 for supplies becomes a normal ritual, even for those just stopping in for a weekend.,And despite claims to four-season splendor, not everyone is in love with the Ossipee spring. â€œThe spring is that mud season, just terrible,â€ù Ms. Sylvia said. â€œItâ€™s kind of bleak, and the trees drop this sort of greenish, dusty pollen that gets all over everything.â€ù,On Ossipee Lake, only about 30 properties are on the market at any given time, real estate agents say, which is not surprising given that there are only 800  lakefront properties.,On average, 20 properties there sell each year, though recently, prices  have dropped by 15 to 20 percent; the peak sales numbers of 2004 and 2005 are a thing of the past, said Gerard Costantino, a managing broker at ReMax Presidential Realty in town.,â€œThe general market conditions have slowed down,â€ù he said. â€œItâ€™s probably going to continue on a downward trend â€” probably not too much depreciation, but not a lot of appreciation.â€ù,Average houses on Ossipee Lake start in the high $300,000 range and can exceed $1 million, though prices around $500,000 are the norm, said Chip Maxfield, a broker at Maxfield Real Estate, which specializes in the Lakes Region. Outside the waterfront area, said George Zavas, who owns Good Life Realty in West Ossipee, houses are much less, averaging $180,000. Mr. Zavas said houses stay on the market for an average of about 180 days.,Among current listings, Mr. Maxfieldâ€™s firm has a one-story waterfront house with two bedrooms and one bathroom, on a peninsula, for $485,900. And Mr. Costantino of ReMax is listing a house, on a channel that branches off from the lake, that has five bedrooms and a guest cottage for $789,000., 4,637, according to a 2005 estimate by the Census Bureau., About 75 square miles., Retirees from across the country and middle-class to upper-middle-class families and couples from neighboring states, especially ,., The drive from , is about two hours, and from New York around five; the airport in ,, N.H., is a 90-minute drive., The Mount Whittier Motel (1695 Route 16, 603-539-4951; ,), a short drive from the lake, offers rooms with Continental breakfast for $59 a night in the fall and winter and $79 in the spring and summer.

"To a certain kind of aesthetic traditionalist there is certainly no more alienating set of words in the artistâ€™s vocabulary than the phrase â€œmixed-media performance.â€ù Such an individual hears those words and fears, more often than not  justifiably, the very worst â€” indulgence, discord, facile earnestness. The mixed-media performer can be  prone to masquerading platitude (war is trying; love, unattainable; materialism, rampant) as position. And in delivering the masquerade in several formats â€”with instruments, computer monitors, acrobats â€” the performer is suggesting that a mere barrage of images will compensate for all crimes of intellectual ambition committed.,Cynthia Hopkins, however,   holds herself to a  higher standard. Her latest piece, â€œMust Donâ€™t Whip â€™Um,â€ù which made its debut at St. Annâ€™s Warehouse earlier this week after a staging in Minneapolis, is a triumph of disciplined thinking, narrative fluidity and musical accomplishment.,Ms. Hopkins tells the story of a failed and missing fictitious 1970s rock singer, Cameron Seymour, through the pieced-together reminiscences of her daughter, Mary, who is making a documentary about her in hopes of figuring out exactly who and what she was. The conceit allows for the use of projected images from live cameras and the presentation of hilarious mock documentary footage â€” witnesses to the era who inform Mary in interviews that her mother wasnâ€™t quite the Janis Joplin genius she had imagined.,Ms. Hopkins nimbly plays both mother and daughter. As Cameron,  she sings a series of haunting and sometimes quite funny songs that she composed herself, accompanied by Ms. Hopkinsâ€™s band, Gloria Deluxe, which moves in and out of view on the upper level of a stage, a scrim serving to hide and reveal it. Ms. Hopkinsâ€™s voice is both so delicate and emotionally forceful â€” part Natalie Merchant, part Madeline Peyroux â€” that it leaves you wondering why she has ever bothered to do anything else but deploy it.,But she  has  done much else, and at the heart of the productionâ€™s magic is her soulful exploration of maternal  abandonment, the conflicts an artistâ€™s life presents, and the solipsism of spiritual quest.

"FIVE years ago, Dr. Robert Williams, a Vermont pediatrician and critical care specialist, lay in his own hospitalâ€™s intensive care unit after a nasty mountain biking accident. Dr. Williams had a variety of serious injuries, including internal bleeding, but he had not sustained a head injury.,Like almost all mountain bikers, he had been wearing a helmet during his accident.,â€œAs I recovered, I started to think about why helmets are universally accepted in sports like mountain biking but not in skiing or snowboarding,â€ù Dr. Williams said. â€œThese are sports that are very similar in demographics and in the risk of serious trauma. Both are actually quite safe, but clearly safer with a helmet.â€ù,A longtime skier who is now an avid snowboarder, Dr. Williams had attended to ski fatalities both in his pediatric intensive care unit and on local mountains as a medical adviser to ski patrollers.,â€œI was in a unique position as someone who works every day to keep children healthy and safe, but given the problems weâ€™re having with obesity in children, I also knew one of the best things for kids is to be out there skiing and riding,â€ù Dr. Williams said. â€œItâ€™s a lot safer for them to be on the mountain than spending the day on the couch with the computer staring at MySpace.,â€œA helmet was just a logical choice, but I didnâ€™t want to scare anyone into wearing one. I wanted them to see, that just like in other sports, the really cool, expert athletes always wear a helmet.â€ù,With the help of some colleagues and sponsors and the support of local ski areas, Dr. Williams started a campaign to increase helmet use in children. Four years later, the program appears to be succeeding, and Dr. Williams has also come across more reasons to wear a helmet as ski areas evolve and expand into new territory. That goes for adults as well as children.,The fact is that, although recent studies suggest that only one in three skiers and snowboarders wears a helmet, the percentage of helmet wearers is climbing every year. Moreover, unlike adult skiers and riders over 35 years old, most younger skiers and snowboarders grew up wearing a helmet.,In a generation, it is likely that it will be as rare to see someone skiing or riding without a helmet as it is now rare to see someone playing hockey or riding a road bike without a helmet â€” two things people routinely did without helmets just a generation ago.,Dr. Williams thinks that the exploding popularity of terrain parks and backcountry forays only makes a helmet more essential these days. For years, one of frequent excuses for not wearing a helmet was, â€œI donâ€™t ski that fast.â€ù,There are two holes in that way of thinking. One, studies with radar guns have indicated that many people do actually ski quite fast, with the majority on intermediate groomed runs reaching speeds of 25 miles an hour and higher. Just the impact of falling down and hitting the back of your head at that speed is hazardous.,The other truth is that you donâ€™t need to be going very fast to sustain a serious head injury. Dr. Williamsâ€™s group â€” whose project has been named PHAT, an acronym for Protect Your Head on All Terrain and Protect Your Head at All Times â€” took radar guns into the terrain parks and gladed tree runs at Smugglersâ€™ Notch, a renowned family-oriented Vermont mountain. They discovered that 79 percent of the people maneuvering through the trees were going slower than 15 miles an hour and that 94 percent of the people in the parks were moving that slowly.,I realized that with so many people coming off groomed runs to ski in the glades or play in the parks, a helmet may be even more effective at preventing a head injury than people thought,â€ù Dr. Williams said. â€œObviously, even at a slower speed, itâ€™s a good idea to have a helmet on if youâ€™re negotiating through rocks and trees. The same is true if youâ€™re jumping on metal rails or doing tricks in the halfpipe. The packed, sculpted walls of halfpipes are very hard.â€ù,To help get the message out, PHAT, which is a partnership of Vermont Childrenâ€™s Hospital at Fletcher Allen Health Care and the University of Vermont College of Medicine, has promoted helmet use with posters and brochures and during daylong events on busy days at the base of Smugglersâ€™ Notch and other state ski areas. PHAT has also tried to persuade more ski patrollers and ski instructors to wear helmets, in recognition of their influence as role models.,The Vermont Ski Areas Association has helped support the project, as have six other Vermont ski areas: Bolton Valley, Bromley, Jay Peak, Ascutney, Sugarbush and Okemo. During the just concluded National Ski Safety Week, some areas were discounting lift tickets, lessons and rentals by 50 percent with the purchase of a helmet.,When PHAT began charting helmet use in Vermont children four years ago, more than half were in helmets, with the highest rates among skiers. Last winter, more than 80 percent were wearing helmets, with some of the most significant gains among snowboarders. The percent of helmet-wearing riders who were girls jumped from 55 percent to 91 percent.,Dr, Williams believes the PHAT program could be replicated nationwide, especially if it promotes helmet use as the choice of the most dedicated, loyal skiers and riders.,â€œA helmet is not a pass to act irresponsibly,â€ù Dr. Williams said. â€œThere used to be a worry that people would think they can behave like Superman because theyâ€™re wearing a helmet. Thereâ€™s no medical evidence of that happening. But what we have seen is that the most devoted or accomplished skiers and riders have helmets on.â€ù,PHATâ€™s research, for example, revealed that season-pass holders were more than twice as likely to wear a helmet than the nationwide average. That led to another PHAT campaign with a poster and sticker that reads: â€œSki like a local, wear a helmet.â€ù,â€œWe were trying to make it O.K. to wear a helmet for the entry level or intermediate skier or rider,â€ù Dr. Williams said. â€œItâ€™s a way of saying: â€˜Look, youâ€™re not going to look like a nerd. This is what the locals wear.â€™ You know, itâ€™s a cool thing.â€ù",BILL PENNINGTON,"JAN. 26, 2007",Showing Young Skiers That â€˜Really Coolâ€™ Athletes Wear Helmets,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/travel/escapes/26ski.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"From the January 1, 2007, edition of The New York Times:,""Several bloggers reported last week that they had received Acer Ferrari laptops, which can sell for more than $2,200, from Microsoft. A spokeswoman for Microsoft confirmed on Friday that the company had sent out about 90 computers to bloggers who write about technology and other subjects"" that could be affected by the release of Windows Vista, Microsoft's new operating system.,""Being provided an evaluation computer from Acer is not a 'bribe,'"" argued blogger Blake Handler, after receiving one of the free laptops. ""It simply allows me to accelerate my evaluations, documentation and demonstrations of Windows Vista."",OMG! You've got to be kidding me, Blake. I guess just being *lent* a laptop wouldn't have been enough to accelerate your evaluations? I guess only being given a freebie from Microsoft would do the trick.,Now, I realize it must be hard to send a shiny new laptop back to the mother ship just because it's the right thing to do. Still, I think very little of the bloggers who are keeping Microsoft's bribe laptops.,Clearly, they're exploiting the lawless, Brave New World of the blogsophere, where, since they're Not Quite Journalists, they don't feel constrained by any of those pesky journalistic ethics guidelines. Like the one that says, ""You don't keep $2,200 gifts from the subject of your review. You might think you can still write an impartial review, but it's highly unlikely-and either way, nobody will believe it."",But Microsoft gets much of the blame, too. It deliberately exploited a weak spot in today's court of public opinion: how bloggers influence consumers, but generally don't have conflict-of-interest policies.,Now, I realize that this isn't exactly breaking news; in fact, it's three weeks old. I wasn't even going to bring it up, but yesterday I remembered something: this isn't the first time.,In fact, Microsoft has tried to buy public opinion in secret over and over again in the last few years. Here are a few examples-mainly, the ones where Microsoft was caught:,In 1998, the Los Angeles Times reported that Microsoft, during its antitrust trials, hired PR companies to flood newspapers with fake letters of support, bearing ordinary individuals' names but actually written by Microsoft PR staff.,Later, during the antitrust trials, Microsoft attempted to prove the inseparability of Windows and Internet Explorer by playing a video for the judge. But the government's lawyer noticed that as the tape rolled on, the number of icons on the desktop kept changing. Microsoft had spliced together footage from different computers to make its point.,Then in 2002, Microsoft's Web site featured a testimonial called ""Confessions of a Mac to PC Convert,"" a first-person account by an attractive brunette ""freelance writer"" about how she had fallen in love with Windows XP.,Unfortunately, a Slashdot member discovered that the identical photo was available for rent from the stock-photo libraries of GettyImages.com. Sure enough: Microsoft had hired a PR firm to write the testimonial. The ""switcher"" did not actually exist.,I am not, and never will be, a knee-jerk Microsoft basher. I'll give its products good reviews whenever they're deserved (as I have with, for example, Media Center, Windows Vista and Office 2007).,But for goodness' sake: Why is Microsoft so insecure? Why can't it allow its software to stand on its own? Why does it feel the necessity to spin public opinion using these phony ""grass-roots"" marketing tactics?,Here's a wake-up call to the Machiavellis on Microsoft's PR team: bribing bloggers, fabricating reviews and making up letters to the editor makes the company look worse, not better.,If Microsoft really wants to earn high marks from the public, it might want to consider earning them the old-fashioned way: By creating products people love.",DAVID POGUE,"JAN. 25, 2007",A Wake-Up Call to Microsoft's PR Team,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/technology/25pogue-email.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(A pair of tickets to one of the two annual Duke-North Carolina games â€” rituals of a deep rivalry â€” can sell for well over $1,000.) Or skip the battle to get into the arena entirely and settle in with a domestic draft at one of the campus-area pubs at game time.,Each school has its places: Playmakers in Raleigh for North Carolina State, for example, or ,, a pizza joint in downtown Durham, for Duke. Four Corners near the North Carolina campus is named for the strategy made famous by Dean Smith, coach of the Tar Heels from 1961 to 1997 (record against Duke: 59 wins; 35 losses). â€œWe put the volume up for the Duke game,â€ù said the manager, Sara Givens-Thomas, â€œso people can root against them.â€ù,The games themselves, particularly Duke vs. North Carolina, are passionate. The arenas seem pressure packed, as if the roofs would blow off at any moment. Students, many with their faces painted in school colors, stand for  whole games and taunt, in colorful language, the opponents and the officials.,â€œYou feel like you're really close to the action,â€ù said Michelle Stansbury, a senior majoring in cultural anthropology at Duke.,Home-team players are revered. In the bookshops on Franklin Street in Chapel Hill, which runs next to the sprawling, tree-lined University of North Carolina campus, you can pick up a literary best seller or a used economics text and then select from racks of jerseys screen-printed with 50 â€” the number worn by Tyler Hansbrough, the sophomore star forward. (Asked how it felt to be such a celebrity, Mr. Hansbrough, who just turned 21, shrugged and said, â€œThat's pretty much true for anyone on the team.â€ù),Eight miles to the northeast, on the manicured campus of Duke University, an incongruous tent city called Krzyzewskiville was functioning one day early this month as impromptu housing for aspirants waiting in line for the limited number of free student tickets, which aren't given out until game days. Mike Krzyzewski is Duke's basketball coach â€” he is bowed to by Duke students as he walks onto the court, and some fans wear chef's hats and aprons, a play on the pronunciation of his name: shuh-SHEF-ski.,This line, for the game with North Carolina scheduled for Feb. 7, had formed on Jan. 2. Wearing a blue Duke ski cap and wrapped in a blanket, Ms. Stansbury sat in a lawn chair at the front of the line. She planned to switch off with friends and go to class and to Duke's other home basketball games â€” the Duke student government has an elaborate list of rules for holding a place in line â€” but she expected to ride it out. â€œIt's part of the Duke experience,â€ù she said cheerfully.,It is an exclusive experience because Cameron Indoor Stadium (named for Eddie Cameron, a former basketball coach and athletic director) holds only 9,314. Any suggestion of a new arena, however, is always quickly squashed. Cameron is practically a temple to basketball, paneled and cozy on the inside, Gothic and stately on the outside, in the same Duke-Gothic architectural style that finds its highest expression at the campus chapel. Cameron's immaculate corridors, lined with displays of photographs and old uniforms, function partly as a museum. â€œPeople who come to Duke want to see the chapel and Cameron,â€ù said Mitch Moser, the associate athletic director who is in charge of Duke basketball tickets. â€œAnd not necessarily in that order.â€ù,For the games, the atmosphere has been scrubbed to the basics. Cheerleaders dance to pep-band music. Ads are in the corners. The refreshment stand is a place to get a snack, not a meal. Josh McRoberts, a Duke sophomore forward, said, â€œWe know we play in a special place.â€ù,The students kick-start the zaniness by jumping up and down, and it does not take long for their elders to join in. Midway through the first half of a game against Temple in early January, students pointed to the upper seats and chanted, â€œCrazy towel guy!â€ù A middle-aged man wearing a chef's hat stood and to raucous cheers spun a white towel over his head.,â€œThere's more energy here than anywhere in the country,â€ù Scott Eren, a sophomore political science major from Durham, said through deep-blue lips. In addition to blue face paint, he wore devil's horns.,One night later, three sophomores â€” Brian Everhart, Alec Brinn and Steve McQuaid â€” were painted a lighter shade of blue at the Dean E. Smith Center, a k a the Dean Dome, in Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels, No. 4 in the latest men's rankings, were beating the University of Pennsylvania, but Duke, 10th in the poll, was not far from the students' minds. â€œDuke's uppity,â€ù said Mr. McQuaid, who wore a belt with â€œGo Heelsâ€ù banner that lighted up like a theater marquee. â€œThey don't know anything about basketball. They're all from New Jersey, anyway.â€ù,Another dedicated fan, turning his head  from the action only when approached for handshakes, was John Edwards, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, who sat with his wife, Elizabeth, whom he met at the University of North Carolina School of Law, and their two youngest children.,IF a Duke game is like a symphony, a North Carolina game is improvisational jazz. The Dean Dome seats a far bigger crowd than does Cameron â€” 21,750 â€” and has a show-biz ambience, with giant video screens and N.B.A.-like pregame music.  Its current version of a basketball museum is a sports memorabilia room on the second floor, but an athletic center that's being built next door will have a basketball museum on the first floor.,North Carolina State's palatial 19,000-seat arena northwest of Raleigh has the look of a professional arena, with suites and well-padded red seats. Because the Wolfpack has not been as successful recently in basketball as its two neighbors, a game at North Carolina State, which is not among the top 25 teams this season, is usually easier to get into than one at Chapel Hill or Durham â€” unless the University of North Carolina or Duke is the opponent. Those games are packed to the rafters. State is placing its hopes on a new coach, Sidney Lowe, who was the point guard on its last national championship team, in 1983.,All three Triangle towns have a life outside basketball, even in winter. Raleigh, the state capital, offers big-city amenities â€” museums and galleries, the defending Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes and  live music at the Hideaway BBQ and the Lincoln Theater. Durham has the Bulls, the minor-league baseball team made famous in the film â€œBull Durham,â€ù and a collection of lemurs at Duke. Chapel Hill draws high-end shoppers to A Southern Season, a  huge luxury food emporium.,For a pregame restaurant meal, the Triangle offers  choices, from the elegant ,s classic French cooking outside Chapel Hill to steaks in a Raleigh-area shopping center at a place called Jimmy V's. It's named for â€” who else? â€” the late Jimmy Valvano, the coach who led State to that national championship in 1983.,THE best way in and out of ,'s Triangle area is through the Raleigh-Durham airport, off Interstate 40 between the two cities. You will know this is basketball country because the airport has an Atlantic Coast Conference souvenir store and there is the Carolina Varsity Bar and Grill.,Information on Triangle basketball is at the universities' sports Web sites: ,; ,; and ,.,Franklin Street in Chapel Hill is the main thoroughfare for the North Carolina campus. Four Corners (919-968-3809) is at 175 East Franklin Street. Sit at the lunch counter at Sutton's Drug Store (159 East Franklin Street, 919-942-5161), which has been open since 1923, and try the Tar Heel turkey club for $5.29.,Hillsborough Street in Raleigh, the main drag next to the North Carolina State campus, offers slightly funkier choices. The medium â€” better described as enormous â€” Italian subs ($6.99) at Sub Conscious (3209 Hillsborough Street, 919-833-3495) are on fresh rolls. Playmakers (919-743-5544) is at 3801 Hillsborough Street. In Durham, Satisfaction (919-682-7397) is at 905 West Main Street.,Hideaway BBQ (2210 Capital Boulevard, Raleigh; 919-828-5226) features country music. The Lincoln Theater (126 East Cabarrus Street, Raleigh; 919-821-4111) offers a variety of music.,At the Fearrington House (2000 Fearrington Village Center, Pittsboro; 919-542-2121), a three-course French meal is $65. At Jimmy V's Steakhouse & Tavern (MacGregor Village, Cary; 919-380-8210) the 36-ounce porterhouse is $46.,The Duke Lemur Center (919-489-3364; ,), which gives refuge to a wide variety of endangered lemurs, lorises and bushbabies, has tours by appointment.,The Triangle is an excellent place to play golf year-round.

"Time is forever. Love is the goal. Art is what you are, not what you do. Many young artists and poets in California in the 1950s and â€™60s felt and lived this way. And a traveling band of them, trailing a cloud of marijuana-fragrant air, has arrived at the Grey Art Gallery in â€œSemina Culture: Wallace Berman & His Circle.â€ù,The mostly dense paintings, drawings and collages in the show make visual sense in New York today. Updated versions of their type have flooded galleries in the last few years. Yet the throwaway, amateur-proud spirit that propelled the older work is largely absent in the new. It belongs to another time and place, with a different set of possibilities and necessities, to a small imploded star, now far, far away, called Underground.,The artist Wallace Berman (1926-76) lived on that star. His name still rings only a faint bell. Actually, he was something of a mystery even to his friends, who were legion and seem to have loved him deeply. And as the show, a kind of scrapbook of art and ephemera, makes clear, three decades after his death he is well worth getting to know.,Born in Staten Island, a child of Russian Jews, he moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was 9 and turned into a classic California oddball. He loved sports, jazz, mind-altering substances, Dada, inside jokes and esoteric spiritual systems, notably the kabbalah. A spiritually minded secularist, he was intensely sociable and intensely quiet, a family man whose house was open to all.,He was also a collagist, painter, photographer and poet; his immersion in art was complete. He not only made it but also inspired others to make it, sparking hidden aptitude in startling places. After meeting him, drifters, movie stars, ex-marines and petty criminals found themselves starting to paint and write.,By temperament a collaborator, he was also, in his nonentrepreneurial way, a promoter. With other artists, he briefly opened a gallery in a roofless houseboat and gave one-day shows to people he admired. Shy of showing his own work, he had few exhibitions; one, at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1957, was particularly memorable. It led to his arrest for exhibiting lewd material.,The offending piece, a drawing of a copulating couple, was not by him but by a friend, Marjorie Cameron Parsons Kimmel (1922-95), an artist, performer and occult practitioner who went by the single name Cameron. (She is currently the subject of a solo show at Nicole Klagsbrun in Chelsea.) The image appeared in the first issue of Mr. Bermanâ€™s loose-leaf journal, Semina, copies of which he had scattered around the gallery floor.,It was Semina that carried Mr. Berman, and the artists and poets he championed, beyond a local audience. He produced the journal from 1955 to 1964 on a mail-order hand press with the help of two friends, the artist and poet Robert Alexander and the photographer Charles Brittin. There were only nine issues. The print run was minute. The contents were mind-boggling.,The magazine, its pages randomly compiled, mixed Berman heroes like Antonin Artaud and Jean Cocteau with established American poets like Robert Duncan and Allen Ginsberg, then added a slew of younger writers and artists â€” Philip Lamantia, Jack Anderson, Patricia Jordan, Kirby Doyle, Bob Kaufman, Aya Tarlow, Ruth Weiss, Michael McClure, the great gay poet John Wieners â€” all barely out of the starting gate. Sent, copy by copy, through the mail, Semina defined a distinctively trippy, sardonic West Coast surrealism. New York had hard, cold Pop; the West Coast had a woozy Peyote-Funk that prefigured the hippie era.,If the journal put Wallace Bermanâ€™s name on the national countercultural grapevine, his personal influence was still transmitted through artists and poets who met him. And four dozen of them take brief, individual bows in a show â€” organized for the Santa Monica Museum of Art by two independent curators and critics, Michael Duncan and Kristine McKenna â€” that feels like both a slice of still-warm history and a reliquary.,Several of the artists are now far better known than Mr. Berman himself. Joan Brown (1938-90), Bruce Conner and Jay De Feo (1929-89) are textbook figures. Ms. Brownâ€™s fetishistic â€œMan on Horseback,â€ù a 1957 sculpture of rolled and tied cloth, is an eye-catcher. So are two sumptuously abject assemblages by Mr. Conner, who also has an outstanding show of early work at Susan Inglett Gallery in Chelsea.,And for relics, thereâ€™s the pigment-caked footstool that Ms. De Feo used while creating â€œThe Rose,â€ù a painting that grew so heavy with applied matter that, at 2,000 pounds, it had to be forklifted from her tenement studio.,More famous at the time were Hollywood actors like Dean Stockwell and Russ Tamblyn, who met Mr. Berman and started making art. Another was Dennis Hopper, who picked up photography and film directing. (He cast Mr. Berman in a small role in â€œEasy Rider.â€ù) And there was Billy Gray. A teenage heartthrob as Bud Anderson on â€œFather Knows Best,â€ù he started making stained-glass sculptures after a drug arrest in 1962 crippled his show business career.,Chemicals of all descriptions gradually pulled the Berman circle down. It comes as a dawning shock to walk through the show and see so many young faces accompanied by so many curtailed dates.,The Pop assemblagist Ben Talbert and the abstract painter Arthur Richer died of drug overdoses in their early 40s. The Hollywood child actor Bobby Driscoll, the voice of Peter Pan in the Disney film and the creator of four glorious little collages in the show, was taken out by heroin at 31. By the end of the 1960s, methamphetamines had ruined John Reed, another wonderful artist and poet; he died homeless, almost all his work lost.,Three of these four, Richer being the exception, had little if any formal art training. They could be called outsider artists, except â€” well, except what? They werenâ€™t crazy enough, or poor enough, or â€œethnicâ€ù enough, or in some other way picturesque enough to qualify for that exaltedly abject name?,Their work is interesting in large part exactly because it muddies market-driven aesthetic divisions instituted since their day: artist versus outsider artist, trained versus self-taught, professional versus amateur. Most of the artists in the show fall on the alternative side of the equations.,In fact, one of the things that made them a â€œcircle,â€ù if they can really be called that, was their shared lack of traditional bona fides. They were artists because they said they were, and acted as if they were, and because someone â€” Wallace Berman â€” said, â€œYou are.â€ù Where would they have stood in relation to todayâ€™s standardized, professionalized art industry? Where , such artists stand today, since there are surely many out there, living artistsâ€™ lives?,Anyway, for the purposes of the exhibition, the Berman connection is the crucial link, the bond that makes outsiders insiders. They are held within his orbit, which Mr. Duncan and Ms. McKenna, in their charismatic catalog, depict as an accepting, protective space.,Acceptance, and the psychological protection it affords, are rare and invaluable. Are they extended to artists today, to all artists, equally? They should be. They must have felt especially necessary as the cold war 1950s turned into the Vietnam War 1960s, as modern art moved into its radically disruptive postmodern phase.,And as casualties among the artists and poets gathered in the show began to grow, no high in the world could have hidden the truth that time is very short, and that love is only as trustworthy as its object. People trusted Mr. Berman; that was the bottom line. They found him steady and there. I donâ€™t believe in gurus, and especially not in art gurus, even those like Wallace Berman who didnâ€™t want to be one. But I can understand why, when he died after being hit by a drunken driver on the eve of his 50th birthday, there was much grief.",HOLLAND COTTER,"JAN. 26, 2007",A Return Trip to a Faraway Place Called Underground,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/arts/design/26semi.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BUTTE, Mont. â€” This is the city that copper built, in the mountains atop the Continental Divide.,When the copper played out, though, most of the people left. A city of more than 80,000 people at the turn of the 20th century, Butte now has about 35,000 residents. The dwindling population has left many historic buildings in the heart of uptown Butte empty or greatly underused.,Now community leaders hope the lure of cheap square footage in the 19th- and early 20th-century structures will transform the decaying former mining-company town into a refuge for artists, whose creativity will spark reclamation.,â€œArt brings hope,â€ù said Glenn Bodish, the executive director of the Butte Silver Bow Arts Foundation. â€œEverybody went to work for the company, and followed the companyâ€™s rules, and when they left people lost their jobs and were knocked over.â€ù The city makes up part of one of the largest National Historic Landmarks in the country based on the number of buildings. But for decades many structures were abandoned for back taxes. Many sat empty with broken windows, or fell prey to arsonists or wrecking balls. That is changing. Artists understand craftsmanship, Mr. Bodish said, and can find beauty in the neglected buildings.,â€œI love the history,â€ù said Steven Nordgren, a restoration graphic designer from Detroit who moved here last year in large measure because of the architecture.,â€œEverybody is doing decal arts these days,â€ù Mr. Nordgren said. â€œBut I love working with the lost arts, the historic applications of glue-chip glass, applied gold leaf, plaster restoration, stenciling and trompe lâ€™oeil in churches and theaters.â€ù,The arts renaissance here began in a chateau-style home built in 1898 by Charles Clark, the son of William Clark, one of the copper kings who built the bustling metropolis over veins of copper beneath what was called the richest hill on earth. The home is now a museum.,Five years ago, the Butte Silver Bow Arts Foundation bought a burned-out coffee shop, the Blue Venus, in an old building next to Venus Alley, the mining townâ€™s largest red-light district. The coffee shop has been renamed Venus Rising, a metaphor for the arts community that has started to rise from the ruins of Butte. There are nine employees,  and an art gallery in the back. An artist-in-residence works in a studio upstairs. The foundation is now partly financed through this and other small business operations.,For a dollar, the foundation just bought the old Y.M.C.A., a classic 1917 building, and opened 18 studios, already fully occupied, and an art-supply store.,â€œItâ€™s cool that there are enough artists to fill up this building,â€ù said Patricia Briggs, a fantasy writer who returned to Butte after leaving, and now has a studio in the Y.M.C.A.,While some artists have been recruited, others have shown up on their own. John Richen, a sculptor from California, got off Interstate 90 for a rest stop and fell in love with the town. He recently remodeled two historic buildings, turning one into a coffee shop and the one next door into a restaurant.,Dawn and John Wexo, who are both writers and sculptors, are moving their bronze foundry from Buffalo, Wyo., to Butte. They hope to locate in a hoist house called Mountain Con, a large building where machinery once lowered miners in elevators into the tunnels.,Longtime Butte artists say the renaissance has been invigorating.,â€œItâ€™s exciting,â€ù said Toni Seccomb, a sculptor and member of Main Stope Gallery, an artistsâ€™ cooperative that takes its name from the timber that holds up a mine. â€œThere are more artists around, and the creativity feeds on it. Butte is also still affordable, and the rest of , isnâ€™t.â€ù,And there is hope for a kind of artistic reparation. An art collection amassed by William Clark, the copper tycoon, is in the Clark Wing that he financed at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. The arts foundation would like to bring it to Butte, at least on temporary loan, after the gymnasium at the Y.M.C.A. is converted into a gallery to be called the Museum of Fine Arts Butte.,â€œFor Mr. Clark to amass his collection cost Butte economic, cultural and environmental devastation,â€ù Mr. Bodish said. â€œButte has been sacrificed for America. Bringing part of this collection back temporarily is a gesture of their understanding how important Butte was in American history. It closes the loop.â€ù,Butte demands a lot from the artists, and others, who move here. Temperatures plummeted to 33 degrees below zero this month, not uncommon here in the Rockies. In 1989, the city set a record wind-chill temperature of 91 below.,â€œYou spend time inside,â€ù said Donna Croitz, a sculptor who moved here from Dallas in 2005 and has a studio at the Y.M.C.A. â€œAnd I keep pictures of beaches on the wall.â€ù",JIM ROBBINS,"JAN. 26, 2007",Artistic Revival Takes Root Amid Relics of Copper Mines,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/us/26butte.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Viewers who complain that the auditions on this seasonâ€™s â€œAmerican Idolâ€ù are too cruel are missing the point.,They are cruel, but there are more victims than the two young men who were so viciously ridiculed by  Simon Cowell that they ended up as guests on the â€œTodayâ€ù program  and â€œJimmy Kimmel Live.â€ù One, Jonathan Jayne, who has a mild form of autism, turns out to be a video savant:,â€œI think that he was just, you know, trying to make television,â€ù Mr. Jayne said of his tormentor. â€œTheyâ€™re just actors, and theyâ€™re out to make a buck and increase ratings.â€ù,The larger  cruelty of Foxâ€™s â€œAmerican Idol,â€ù its NBC look-alike â€œGrease: Youâ€™re the One That I Want,â€ù â€œThe Apprenticeâ€ù and even â€œArmed and Famousâ€ù (Erik Estrada?!), is a generational snub. Reality television, which was originally created as a thumb-nosing alternative for the young (â€œThe Real Worldâ€ù), has been co-opted by the baby boomers, who never miss a chance to assert their hegemony on popular culture.,Itâ€™s not so much that they watch the shows, though many do. Itâ€™s that reality television aims for younger viewers, 18 to 34, while subliminally underscoring and cementing their fealty to the relaxed-fit generation.,Whether it is a firing by Donald Trump or a personal attack by Mr. Cowell, each rejection is a symbolic re-enactment of an inter-era struggle in which the bullies always come out on top.,It explains the popularity of â€œGrease,â€ù a contest for the two leads in a Broadway revival of a show that first opened  in New York in 1972 and became a hit film in 1978. Itâ€™s a favorite high school production, so the contestants  â€”  and younger viewers  â€”  already know the lyrics by heart. â€œGreaseâ€ù is also reconstituted nostalgia for a pre-Aquarian era only the oldest baby boomers tasted first hand. (The hugely popular made-for-TV Disney movie â€œHigh School Musical,â€ù on the other hand, seems to be the next â€œGreaseâ€ù for Generation Z.),The survival of â€œThe Apprenticeâ€ù on NBC is surely a sign of the viewerâ€™s unconscious impulse to relive the conflict between young and refuse-to-get-old. Season after season, good-looking, ambitious young people willingly abase themselves before a mercurial, aging baby boomer with odd hair and ostentatious taste. Every episode contains a reminder that Mr. Trump is a sovereign whose favor must be recaptured time and time again.,â€œYouâ€™re expecting an experience where youâ€™re going to taste the Trump lifestyle,â€ù Aaron, a sweet-faced real estate manager, said mournfully after his team on â€œThe Apprentice: Los Angelesâ€ù lost a round and was banished to outdoor tents and cold-water showers. â€œRight now itâ€™s still dangling in front of my nose.â€ù,Senator Barack Obama of Illinois considers himself part of the post-boomer generation. (Boomers are usually defined as those born between 1946 and 1964, so Mr. Obama, born in 1961, is actually at the tail end of the second wave.) In his bid for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Obama says he hopes to steer the country away from the ideological battles of Vietnam and Watergate, but he knows better than to challenge pop radio playlists or nostalgia programming on cable.  They may not be the greatest generation, but baby boomers are the bossiest and most imposing, and they have a way of muscling their way past young upstarts and innovators. NBC quickly cut a deal with YouTube, and a parody of iPhone  from the networkâ€™s â€œLate Night With Conan Oâ€™Brienâ€ù has been viewed 1.4 million times.,Baby boomers will watch â€œLaw & Orderâ€ù and â€œCSI,â€ù bankrupt Social Security, deplete Medicare and go noisily, dementedly into gated retirement communities with their shriveled, arthritic fingers still pushing the levers of culture and clutching the remote.,Revolutionaries turn reactionary once they seize control; the generation that prided itself on freedom and nonconformity keeps Generations X and Y walking behind it in lock step, weaned on reruns of â€œM*A*S*Hâ€ù and remakes of  â€œCharlieâ€™s Angelsâ€ù and each new lunar phase of Madonna. Like the youngest children in a large family, the post-boom generations are living on hand-me-down pop culture, and donâ€™t seem to mind.,Itâ€™s not just that the songs on â€œGreaseâ€ù and â€œAmerican Idolâ€ù are by the likes of Toto, Debbie Harry or Stevie Wonder. â€œAmerican Idolâ€ù presents aging singers like Barry Manilow and Rod Stewart as hot, contemporary artists. They are depicted as mentors to the contestants, but they mainly leech the showâ€™s popularity to boost their album sales.,Like their rivals on â€œAmerican Idol,â€ù the three judges on â€œGreaseâ€ù are baby boomers. Even when those shows bring in a guest judge, it is only rarely a younger artist, like  the only slightly passÃ© singer Jewel. Most often itâ€™s a celebrity old enough to have watched the funeral of John F. Kennedy on live television, like the songwriter Carole Bayer Sager or Olivia Newton-John, who played Sandy in the film version of â€œGrease.â€ù,The producers could just as easily recruit successful performers in their 20s to balance the bench, but they donâ€™t want to and donâ€™t have to: younger viewers identify with the supplicants begging to be tapped, not with the authority figures who determine their fate.,The few who talk back in tryouts, like Ian Benardo, 25, who swanned on stage  and demanded to see Mr. Cowellâ€™s visa, are kept in for amusement, but the editing ensures that they leave the show looking nutty and even dangerous.,Parents play an important role on these reality shows, a signal  that there is no generation gap between boomers and their offspring; children owe their happiness and even their success to their fathers and mothers.,Mr. Trump has replaced seasoned executives from the boardroom with two of his children, the stone-faced Ivanka and the eager-to-please Donald Jr., and constantly reminds them that they owe their livelihood to Dad. â€œThese are my children, but they are not children,â€ù Mr. Trump informed his newest crop of would-be apprentices. â€œThey are very talented business people.â€ù,There probably are young business executives in the world who are not related to the boss and can be held up as role models (Google founders come to mind), but that may undermine Mr. Trumpâ€™s cultivated air of infallibility. The series prefers to warn  young viewers that real power lies in the hands of those born after World War II and before the Gulf of Tonkin: a band of yuppies that cannot be left behind.,While filming part of an episode at the Loews Hotel in Santa Monica, Calif., Mr. Trump made a plug not just for the hotel chain, but also for its chairman and chief executive, Jonathan Tisch. â€œHeâ€™s been my boss for 27 years; heâ€™s a great man,â€ù the hotel manager dutifully tells Mr. Trump.,Mr. Trump replies, â€œHeâ€™s a great man, and heâ€™s a great friend of mine.â€ù,Even rebellious children beg for  parentsâ€™ approval, and parents keep the upper hand. Sarah, 19, slipped away from home in Ohio to audition for â€œIdolâ€ù without telling her father, and she wept so poignantly about needing his blessing that the showâ€™s host, Ryan Seacrest, helped her call home to break the news.,â€œDad, I have something to tell you, please donâ€™t be mad at me, Dad,â€ù she said tearfully into her cellphone.,â€œWho is this?â€ù her father replied.,Baby boomers donâ€™t eat their young; they just keep them hooked on their leftovers.",ALESSANDRA STANLEY,"JAN. 26, 2007",Reality Check for a Generation That Knows Best,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/arts/television/26real.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The American Folk Art Museumâ€™s transporting exhibition of the scroll-like drawings of the Mexican artist MartÃ_n RamÃ_rez (1895-1963) should render null and void the insider-outsider distinction.,RamÃ_rez, who created the roughly 300 drawings that make up his known work between 1948 and 1963 while confined to a mental hospital in Northern California, is simply one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He belongs to the group of accessible, irresistible genius draftsmen that includes Paul Klee, Saul Steinberg and Charles Schulz. Well selected and beautifully installed by Brooke Davis Anderson, a curator at the folk art museum, this show of 97 drawings, some mural-size, is the first museum exhibition of RamÃ_rezâ€™s work in New York and one of the best shows of the season.,Whatever ideas about art you hold dear, expect them to be healthily destabilized here. If a purely visual, white-cube experience of the autonomous art object is your thing, you may be startled by the illuminating correlations between the artistâ€™s newly excavated biography and his pulsating images.,If you think art is anything but autonomous and that, rather than speaking for itself, it mainly says what we want it to say, then you must deal with the way these works made enough noise to survive against almost impossible odds.,If you revere outsider artists as pure, isolated, often insane visionaries who exist outside time and place, make way for a so-called outsider whose work reflected many of the specifics of his cultural and historic moment. In addition, RamÃ_rezâ€™s art was in step with the explorations of many â€œinsiderâ€ù artists of his time, especially in his use of collage and images from popular culture.,RamÃ_rez had an indelible style built on a supreme sense of economy and shot through with a mix of sly humor and sunny optimism that coats deeper, darker feelings. He had his own way with materials and color â€” buoyed by an unerring sensitivity to the power of blank paper â€” and a cast of unforgettable characters, including mounted caballeros, levitating Madonnas, and deer and dogs on high alert. But most of all RamÃ_rez had his own brand of pictorial space, which he regulated with rhythmic systems of parallel lines, curved and straight. He played spatial illusion as if it were an accordion, expanding and contracting it in a mesmerizing play of stasis and movement.,He might orchestrate the curved lines  into stepped, hivelike hills punctuated by dark tunnels where ornate trains and buglike cars or buses chug in or out along extravagantly banked roadways or railroad beds defined by further lines. The straight  lines might form fluted, beautifully shaded proscenium stages that bring to mind old-time movie screens. Here we usually find the caballero aiming his pistol in one direction while pointing his reined-in steed in another, as if ready to wheel and dash to safety. This character is RamÃ_rezâ€™s signature motif: the show begins with a posse of 19 caballero drawings, double- and triple-hung on a single wall.,RamÃ_rez changed my art-world view 21 years ago when I was invited to write an essay for the first large, high-profile exhibition of his work, at the Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia. At that time the facts about his life were scant. His birth date was calculated as 1885 instead of 1895. He was thought to have migrated from Mexico around 1915, not 1925, to work on the railroads being built in Northern California, where he was hospitalized in the early 1930s and shortly thereafter found to have schizophrenia. He lived out his years in DeWitt State Hospital in Auburn, near Sacramento. (It was later discovered that the initial years of his confinement were at Stockton State Hospital.),At DeWitt in 1948, a psychologist and artist of Finnish descent named Tarmo Pasto discovered RamÃ_rez and began to save the large drawings he made on available bits of paper glued together with a paste made of bread or potatoes and saliva. In the first gallery at the Folk Art Museum, note the handle of a brown-paper shopping bag at the top edge of a tall, narrow landscape dominated by winding stairs interspersed with white churches and roadside chapels.,Dr. Pasto began bringing RamÃ_rez art materials, and at one point lived on the grounds of DeWitt, a former Army camp, so he could observe RamÃ_rez every day. In the early â€™50s he helped arrange four solo shows of RamÃ_rezâ€™s work, most of them on college campuses, including Syracuse. In 1955 Dr. Pasto sent 10 drawings to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, but never heard back. A museum intern rediscovered them in the mid-1990s, and they were officially accessioned in 1997; all of them have been lent to this exhibition.,In 1968 the Chicago artist Jim Nutt met Dr. Pasto when both men were teaching at Sacramento State, and eventually persuaded him to sell most of his RamÃ_rez drawings to Mr. Nutt and his art dealer, Phyllis Kind. Dr. Pasto wanted to send his son to medical school, and the drawings needed extensive conservation. He could not afford either.,This show is in a sense a tribute to the dedication of Dr. Pasto, who died in 1986, shortly after the opening of the Moore College show, which he was too sick to see. But the Folk Art Museum  exhibition and its catalog also benefited from the efforts of VÃ_ctor M. Espinosa and Kristin E. Espinosa (until recently his wife), sociologists who specialize in the history of immigration.,Mr. Espinosa, who is Mexican, was disturbed by the art worldâ€™s failure to research RamÃ_rezâ€™s roots. He eventually discovered that RamÃ_rez had a wife and four children in Mexico, a stream of descendants there and in California and a painful story of separation and isolation on all sides. The Espinosasâ€™ research, which extended over 15 years, enables this exhibition to align RamÃ_rezâ€™s art with his life.,Among the facts the Espinosas unearthed: RamÃ_rez drew in the margins of his letters home before he was incarcerated, which questions his inclusion in the art-of-the-insane category. The churches depicted in his drawings are recognizably those of the region he came from, the west-central province of Jalisco. There, it turns out, RamÃ_rez owned a horse and was a skillful rider, which sharpens appreciation of the deft fusions of his caballeros with their mounts. As for the fluted post-and-lintel proscenium that frames them so glamorously, DeWitt had a movie theater, so the caballero is probably part Hollywood cowboy.,RamÃ_rezâ€™s shaded lines segue effortlessly from abstract to descriptive and back again, just as his shapes are constantly being adjusted or assigned new roles. When shaded ellipses crown the prosceniums they suggest stage lights; in landscapes they read as cactuses. In one drawing, they are clustered together to form an enormous mountain, complete with a tunnel, that glows from within like a giant jukebox.,Rhythmic surfaces, plunging spaces and various modes of transportation (boats also shunt out of the tunnels, turning the roadways into canals) make visual the themes of distance and separation, isolation and longing. In one drawing, a tiny woman appears at the bottom of a long corridorlike path, while a small man is far above her, boxed in by lines.,Sometimes the prosceniums are inhabited by a man who has shed his sombrero and ammo belts and sits quietly at a table writing letters or perhaps waiting for inspiration to strike. In one of the showâ€™s best drawings, the sides of the stage resemble half-open shutters through which this man is seen against a dense black background. The velvety field is broken by a locomotive trundling over a little hillock, like an ever-present memory â€” an emblem of the way RamÃ_rez revisited his life through his art.,In still other images, the proscenium becomes a portable altarpiece inhabited by a fabulously garbed Madonna with beaming cabochon eyes, a movie-star smile and a spiked crown reminiscent of the Statue of Libertyâ€™s. She is a kind of phantom ur-wife. In three exceptionally large drawings, the Madonna breaks free of RamÃ_rezâ€™s repeating lines and looms over us nearly life-size â€” the only figure to be so honored and the only one to assert a full-fledged personality.,Outsider art is often conveniently artist-free; it has been made by someone who is, as the term implies, on the margins â€” poor, uneducated, nonwhite, mentally ill, dead or otherwise inaccessible. All this makes for an aura of purity and innocence, but also a blankness. The work becomes a vessel, open to interpretation, in need of protection and available for a reverential possession and habitation that is almost a form of colonialism. This exhibition counters such possession by suggesting that RamÃ_rezâ€™s art was, like all great art, typically site-specific, that is, firmly rooted in real experiences and memories that he reshaped and distilled according to his needs and talents. The more we know about this artist, the clearer it becomes that we are just beginning to fathom his extraordinary achievement.",ROBERTA SMITH,"JAN. 26, 2007",Outside In,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/arts/design/26rami.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New Yorkâ€™s senior senator, ,, was a chief architect  â€”  along with Representative Rahm Emanuel in the House  â€”  of the Democratsâ€™ 2006 campaign strategy that helped lead to their take-back  of  Congress  in  November, persuading incumbent Democrats in red states not to retire; countering Karl Roveâ€™s much ballyhooed Republican machine with a hefty war chest and aggressive on-the-ground tactics of their own; and perhaps most important, recruiting and backing candidates (like Jon Tester in Montana, Bob Casey in Pennsylvania and James Webb in Virginia) who could compete in red-leaning states.,In the days after the election, Mr. Schumer cautioned his party against irrational exuberance, noting that the Democratsâ€™ win was largely the result of Republican mistakes and the unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq war, and warning that the party had a lot of work to do if it wanted to turn the â€™06 results into a more lasting majority. In his provocative first book, â€œPositively American,â€ù the senator amplifies these views while laying out a series of concrete proposals for winning back the middle class, from promoting college- tuition tax deductions  to creating a kind of Manhattan Project for freeing the country from its dependence on fossil fuel.,Despite its cheesy red, white and blue cover and a hokey title that sounds like a line plucked from a campaign pamphlet, the book offers a smart, tough-minded appraisal of the Democratic Partyâ€™s weaknesses and challenges, addressing its current identity crisis, as well as many of the strategic and tactical disadvantages that political analysts like Thomas B. Edsall, Mark Halperin and John Harris have said the Democrats face in 2008 and the years to come.,At times, the volume seems to want to be a Democratic version of Newt Gingrichâ€™s â€œContract With America,â€ù but unlike Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Schumer  â€”  who is now the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate  â€”  is not a polarizing bomb-thrower. For that matter, his book, much like his post-â€™80s record in the House and Senate (which includes helping to write the 1994 crime bill, spearheading passage of the Brady Bill, supporting the death penalty and calling for increased Homeland Security measures) is deliberately centrist: practical and pragmatic in tone, Clintonian in its willingness to mix up proposals traditionally labeled liberal or conservative, eager to use common sense to find common ground on issues like education and ,.,This approach can  lead to  recommendations that fall into the category of the obvious â€”  who doesnâ€™t want to reduce cancer, childhood obesity and tax evasion? Who doesnâ€™t want to protect children from pornography?  â€”  while circumventing big, messy, controversial  issues like Social Security and national health care. But if â€œPositively Americanâ€ù doesnâ€™t lay out a new, overarching paradigm for the Democrats, it does provide Mr. Schumerâ€™s party with at least the beginnings of a credible blueprint for change and renewal.,Using a fictional suburban family named the Baileys (reminiscent, consciously or not, of the Bailey family in the classic movie â€œItâ€™s a Wonderful Lifeâ€ù) to illustrate his points, Mr. Schumer writes that his party has made the mistake, in recent years, of forgetting the middle class: â€œWe talked about them, but we didnâ€™t listen to them. Even worse, we were under the illusion that they liked what we had to say. In the 2004 election, the middle class was the runaway bride, and Democrats were left standing at the altar.â€ù,Analyzing data from the Democratsâ€™ 2004 loss, Mr. Schumer writes that â€œwe were competitive among the middle class  â€” voters with household incomes between $30,000 and $75,000  â€”  only because of near unanimous support among middle class African-American votersâ€ù and that that support from â€œAfrican-American voters at all economic levels has a lot more to do with three decades of the Republican Partyâ€™s exploiting white racism to win elections than it does with any great Democratic Party achievements.â€ù Meanwhile, he notes, President Bush beat Senator John Kerry by 22 points among white, middle class voters, who represent a third of the electorate.,He adds that the Democratsâ€™ bruising losses in 2004 were a byproduct of the partyâ€™s failure to offer a â€œcomparable alternativeâ€ù to the Republicansâ€™ clearly articulated vision of a strong interventionist foreign policy, lower taxes and a conservative social-cultural agenda. While Mr. Schumerâ€™s party prevailed in â€™06, he says its message was essentially the â€œnegative image of the Republican messageâ€ù  â€” it was largely reactive.,Mr. Schumer contends that the Republicansâ€™ â€œideological clock has run out,â€ù but adds that the Democrats need to stop playing defense and define what their own party stands for if they want to consolidate last yearâ€™s victories. They need to learn from the Republicans, who are â€œincredibly skillful at identifying clear issues that connect to their values.â€ù They need to come up with â€œa successful construct for how to deal with the war on terror.â€ù They need to stop taking their cue in Washington from special-interest groups. And to counter the Republican media machine, they need to refine their message, create think tanks that will help shape the intellectual debate, and take advantage of â€œthe extensive Democratic and left-leaning â€˜netrootsâ€™ â€ù to help â€œidentify and encourage viable candidates, like Jim Webb and Jon Tester, in the early stages of their races.â€ù,In the second part  of this volume, Mr. Schumer proposes what he calls â€œthe 50 percent solutionâ€ù  â€”  for instance: â€œincrease reading and math scores by 50 percent,â€ù â€œreduce illegal immigration by at least 50 percentâ€ù and â€œincrease our ability to fight terrorism by 50 percent.â€ù Like the bookâ€™s title, this formulation not only feels like a glib, campaign sound bite, but it also does a disservice to the volumeâ€™s more thoughtful and detailed proposals for dealing with complex matters  â€” like stemming the loss of American jobs to outsourcing and globalization by increasing federal education spending, and reducing American dependence on foreign oil in the short term by  using means like    drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, expanding the Energy Star appliance program  and raising fuel-efficiency standards for cars.,Scattered here and there, between such wonky ruminations on legislative policy, are some lively  personal asides about Mr. Schumerâ€™s campaigns  â€” most notably his successful underdog Senate race to unseat Alfonse Dâ€™Amato in 1998. These passages give the reader a glimpse of the grueling, decidedly unglamorous schedule of a politician, and the authorâ€™s dogged approach to his job:  Mr. Schumer, then a relative unknown running in the 1998 Democratic primary against Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green, sitting in his political consultantâ€™s office closet, making endless phone calls to potential supporters; Mr. Schumer, the day after his primary victory, getting the pilot of the one-engine prop plane his campaign had hired to fly low so that his cellphone would work and he could call Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Greenâ€™s top donors; Mr. Schumer staying in $29 rooms at Motel 6â€™s during that â€™98 race to save money and buttonhole voters as they checked out in the morning.,Along the way, Mr. Schumer describes two tests for the prospects of any political campaign: â€œIf you are able to talk about the things you want to talk about, and if the news coverage reflects those things, youâ€™ll win. If the coverage is about other things  â€”  maybe an opponentâ€™s attack, maybe a self-inflicted gaffe or maybe an unexpected event  â€”  youâ€™ll probably lose.â€ù,And: â€œIf you do everything right, and your opponent does everything right, who will win? If itâ€™s you, that means the race is in your hands.â€ù",MICHIKO KAKUTANI,"JAN. 26, 2007",Schumer to Democrats: Challenges Ahead,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/books/26Book.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stephen Colbert, listen up. If any minority lifestyle is overrepresented in the early education of children in the United States, itâ€™s farm life.,Long since agribusiness made working family farms scarcer than henâ€™s teeth, little Americans still sing and learn far too much about chickens, eggs, sheep, wool, dells, troughs, pigs and goats. Not exactly news they can use. Better that kids of 2007 be taught about ring tones, A.T.M.â€™s, cubicles, Best Buys and cup holders.,But then look at â€œBlueâ€™s Room,â€ù the first episode of the big new spinoff of the blockbuster â€œBlueâ€™s Clues,â€ù fresh out on Nick Jr. this morning. There are the puppets (today in overalls): Blue, and her little brother Sprinkles. And here are their tasks: shucking corn, gathering eggs, milking a cow.,Thatâ€™s right: milking a cow. A full-dress demo has the puppets showing the audience how to squeeze the udders to fill a tin pail. This archaism is meant to be part of a progressive, cutting-edge educational television series. Itâ€™s shocking.,â€œBlueâ€™s Roomâ€ù is styled by the channel as â€œthe ultimate play dateâ€ù and a chance for viewers to enter Blueâ€™s world: a dreamy playroom with everything fun in it, including an oafish guy named Joe (Donovan Patton, a stage actor, who also appears on â€œBlueâ€™s Cluesâ€ù). It must be said that Joeâ€™s a little bit creepy, in the way of grown men who superintend childrenâ€™s shows. This effect is not lessened by his Old McDonald uniform. On the first episode heâ€™s mostly absent and the puppets are left to do tasks he assigns them. When he comes home, they all celebrate their obsolete achievements while Joe pretends to play the banjo.,The farm theme, blessedly, is around for only episode one. After that the puppets get all fancy with themes that include music, art and transportation. But the ambition is not restricted to the content of the show. Nick Jr. is also going all out to saturate childrenâ€™s media with â€œBlueâ€™s Roomâ€ù as it plans for the â€œspinoff seriesâ€ù â€” in the words of the press release â€” â€œto roll out on multiple platforms including wireless carriers, video on demand, Nick Jr. video and DVD release.â€ù,Brave new world.

"Miguel Angel Zotto re-entered New York society on Wednesday when his company, Tango X 2, performed for the first time in a decade at City Center. The group, formed in 1988, presented â€œSu Historia,â€ù a two-act show tracing the companyâ€™s history and paying homage to Mr. Zottoâ€™s tango heroes.,The first act is strongest, even though it begins with a fairly overwrought narration of Mr. Zottoâ€™s influences by Claudio Garces, who describes himself as â€œan angel.â€ù As a six-piece orchestra performs on a raised platform, Mr. Zotto, a compact dancer with feet so agile they seem disconnected from his body, performs a sensual, slow tango with Carina Morrudo.,In the dozens of numbers that follow, including the sweetly evocative â€œDe Puro Guapo,â€ù which presents six men practicing tango steps, the dancing is given room to shine with a refreshing, no-frills sensibility.,â€œChoreography Collageâ€ù recreates songs and dances featured in the companyâ€™s previous shows. In â€œMala Junta,â€ù Gabriel Ponce and Analia Morales glide in a traditional number that makes the most of their tension and trust in a silky sequence of dips, lifts and turns.,But the lighting, from harsh to murky, isnâ€™t always flattering, and the music frequently suffers from a weak sound system. Over all, the dances seem rushed â€” more a series of clips than a harmonious showcase.,The bewildering second act introduces unhappy young women arriving in Argentina for new lives â€œin the brothels of Buenos Aires.â€ù In â€œGath & Chaves,â€ù a section named after a department store, women pose as mannequins but come to life to dance a tango, a waltz, a milonga and, finally, a mystifying number called â€œHound Dog.â€ù Here, Mr. Zotto trades his suit jacket for leather and rocks out, looking very much like a hopeless father trying to be hip.,The final section, in honor of the composer Astor Piazzolla, is just as tacky, especially when the women, scantily clad, grind against bandoneÃ_ns, the accordion instrument of tango. Much of the second act meanders with modern influences, and when â€œSu Historiaâ€ù ends, there is an unsettling flatness. For all its early success, the show transforms polished tango into a slick vaudeville act.",GIA KOURLAS,"JAN. 26, 2007",Watching a History Lesson Thatâ€™s Told Through Tango,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/arts/dance/26tang.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not many tenors these days excel in the full-bodied, lyric Puccini and Verdi repertory once owned by the likes of Carlo Bergonzi, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Luciano Pavarotti. The closest we have may be the Italian tenor Marcello Giordani, who took over the role of Rodolfo on Wednesday night for the first of four final performances in the ,â€™s current revival of Pucciniâ€™s â€œBohÃ¨me.â€ù His Mimi was the Chilean soprano Cristina Gallardo-DomÃ¢s, which united the stars of the Metâ€™s acclaimed Anthony Minghella production of Pucciniâ€™s â€œMadama Butterfly.â€ù,It was as Rodolfo that Mr. Giordani made his 1995 Met debut, and it is always rewarding to hear the role sung by a true Puccini tenor. Still, he has been branching out in recent years into weightier repertory, like Verdiâ€™s Manrico and, at the Met, the hefty title role of Berliozâ€™s â€œBenvenuto Cellini.â€ù While such choices testify to his adventurousness, they may explain why his Rodolfo seemed to have lost some of the velvety grace and glowing richness of earlier years. At times he ended melodic phrases abruptly and halted in his delivery. At his best Mr. Giordani can certainly invest a Puccini phrase with vibrant sound and soaring lyricism.,Ms. Gallardo-DomÃ¢s may not have a conventionally beautiful sound, and soft high singing does not come naturally to her. The earthy expressivity and subtle intensity of her singing, however, made her an affecting Mimi.,There were strong performances from the hearty baritone Dwayne Croft, a veteran Marcello; the bright-voiced soprano Ainhoa Arteta as Musetta; and the robust young baritone Aaron St. Clair Nicholson as Schaunard, the role of his Met debut last fall. The most complete vocal and dramatic portrayal came from the charismatic bass-baritone John Relyea as Colline. The bass Paul Plishka did double-duty as the hapless landlord Benoit and the wealthy Alcindoro. Carlo Rizzi was the very capable conductor.,Audiences still swoon when the curtain goes up on the bustling, two-tiered CafÃ© Momus set in Act II of Franco Zeffirelliâ€™s extravagant and critic-proof 1981 production.

"Now in its 15th round, the robust extravaganza known as the Outsider Art Fair might almost be called Establishment. To be sure, compared with uptown fairs itâ€™s still a little short on amenities: no carpets, no-frills booths, a loosey-goosey layout. But this annual event at the Puck Building has longevity and staying power, and its now-classic artists â€” among them Henry Darger, Bill Traylor, Joseph E. Yoakum, Adolf WÃ¶lfli, Scottie Wilson, Howard Finster, James Castle and Elijah Pierce, to name a few â€” keep returning. (MartÃ_n RamÃ_rez, who is starring uptown in a major retrospective at the American Folk Art Museum, appears here, too, at several dealersâ€™ booths.),Yet the fairâ€™s content, wayward, eccentric and visionary, remains as anti-Establishment as can be. Organized by Sanford L. Smith & Associates, the fair is devoted to autodidacts discovered in out-of-the-way places or circumstances, often not even aware their work might be called art. This year, they are represented by 33 dealers from the United States, Europe and Asia.,Aside from its stellar sellers, the fair keeps drawing in fresh talents, and this is one of its better years for new discoveries and artists known but not previously shown here. For starters there is Vaslav Nijinsky (1890-1950), the Russian dancer, whose career was ended in 1919 by schizophrenia. In and out of hospitals for the rest of his life, he created a small body of works on paper during his early years of psychosis, 10 of which are on view at Ricco/Maresca.,Variations on the form of a giant eye or perhaps a celestial body, their intense reds and blacks are sometimes inflected by white, with globe and crescent forms arranged in various configurations. (It has been suggested that they are a sort of dance choreography.),Like Nijinskyâ€™s, much of the work here gives the word obsessive a new dimension, like the embroidered creations and drawings at Galerie St. Etienne by Rosa Zharkikh. A former factory worker in Moscow, she was inspired by visions after a near-death experience. In dense, weblike tangles, with different-colored skeins representing various states of consciousness in Tibetan philosophy, she tries to replicate the flowery costumes she sees in her dreams, and often includes hidden self-portraits and symbolic images.,Working on brown paper bags with colored pencil, Charles Steffen (1927-1995), an artist from Illinois afflicted with schizophrenia, toiled away at home, producing two or three drawings a day. Gnarled but expressive representations of everyday life, they include self-portraits, his bedridden mother, the bank teller who cashed his Social Security checks, flowers from his yard, scenes from a state hospital where he had undergone treatment.,Drawing the same subjects over and over, he experimented from time to time by merging his figures with renderings of plants and tar or tobacco stains he saw on the sidewalk, sometimes combining male and female figures. The works make a poignant showing at Russell Bowman Art Advisory.,Particularly challenging is the art of George Widener (born 1962), who has Aspergerâ€™s syndrome and is widely known as a savant. He makes art from thousands of bits of information stored in his memory relating to dates, statistics and census numbers. The Henry Boxer Gallery from Richmond, England, shows his â€œMegalopolis 123,â€ù in ink on found paper. It is one of his â€œMagic Time Squares,â€ù a powerful puzzler combining a view of a sprawling city with mysterious calendar dates.,Among its newer artists, Cavin-Morris Gallery displays the wonderful drawings of Timothy Wehrle, a 27-year-old Iowan whose precise, intricate narratives in colored pencil are filled with repetitively patterned detail reflecting both personal and worldly thoughts. His â€œWhite Devil Diplomats (the Gift),â€ù for instance, shows 19th-century envoys to Indian tribes bestowing blankets infected with smallpox on Plains Indians.,On the lighter side are the drawings by Karl Vondal, shown at the booth of the Galerie der KÃ_nstler, a showcase for people with psychiatric disabilities in Austria that is making its debut at the fair. Mr. Vondal, who lives at the so-called House of Artists there, shows his appreciation of zaftig young women in lively erotic drawings and wordy collages, depicting them alone or, in one case, playing a football match.,At the Phyllis Kind Gallery, the walls are brightened by the colorful work of Mitsuo Yumoto, a Japanese artist Ms. Kind first showed at the fair in 2005. Entranced by buildings of every sort, from far-off palaces to envisioned mansions to rickety huts, he draws them rapidly, then fills them in with brilliantly expressive colors that suggest a psychedelic glow.,Color has a sensuous presence, too, in the far more complex work of Thomas Burleson (1914-1997) at the Luise Ross Gallery. Working as a shipping inspector of aircraft parts, sometimes creating art on the job, he drew on a rich vocabulary of enigmatic forms. Diagrammatically, with resonant repetitions and a touch of humor, he successfully mixes animals and birds with mechanical forms.,Among the more accessible works are those of two semirealist painters, James Allen at the Judy A. Saslow Gallery and Alexander Lobanov at Galerie Susanne Zander. Mr. Allen, 23, who works at Project Onward, an open studio for artists with special needs in Chicago, makes large, finely observed colored-pencil drawings of the movement of trains â€” elevated cars careering along the New York subway system, a calmer locomotive engine puffing along a track.,Mr. Lobanov (1924-2003), who was deaf and mute and confined in his youth to a Russian psychiatric hospital, was fascinated by guns, pistols and military and Soviet symbols. He paints himself holding a fancy rifle in a duck blind, seemingly agitated as two sportsmen behind him aim at flying birds. For all its naÃ¯vetÃ©, the painting, like the better works at this irascible hodge-podge of a fair, is genuinely affecting.",GRACE GLUECK,"JAN. 26, 2007",A Convocation of the Visionary and Disenfranchised,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/arts/design/26outs.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"LEEâ€™S SUMMIT, Mo., Jan. 25 â€” President Bush urged Congress on Thursday to consider his new health care proposal and indicated he was ready for a fight.,â€œIf people in Washington are serious about dealing with the uninsured, here is a serious idea for them to consider,â€ù Mr. Bush said of his health care plan. â€œTheyâ€™re just dismissing things because of pure politics.â€ù,Mr. Bushâ€™s comments came in a discussion with local doctors, small-business owners and workers here on the second stop of a tour to promote policies he proposed during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.,Even before the speech, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had cast doubt on the chances of Mr. Bushâ€™s package of proposals, which is intended to improve access to health insurance with changes in the tax code. Mr. Rangel called it â€œa bad policyâ€ù; other Democratic leaders have since called the proposal all but â€œdead on arrival.â€ù,Under the proposal, workers would be newly taxed on health care plans provided by employers that were valued above new â€” and, administration officials say, generous â€” standard deductions for health care benefits. Individuals would in turn be able to buy insurance plans tax-free.,White House officials said they had received more positive feedback from some Senate Democrats, but the plan has drawn fierce resistance from the labor unions.,With record low approval ratings and most of his remaining political capital  going into the defense of his new strategy for the Iraq war, Mr. Bush has little sway over Congress on his new plans, pollsters and analysts say.,But Mr. Bushâ€™s aides have said that they would try to build pressure on Democrats by accusing them of turning their backs on his proposals before truly considering them.,â€œWe proposed a bold initiative,â€ù Mr. Bush said here. â€œI know Americans expect that the United States Congress will take a look at all ideas.â€ù,The president  spoke at St. Lukeâ€™s Hospital here,  where he asked a group of workers, business owners and administrators how the current system worked  against them and how the new system would help them.,Martha Gelencher, a small-business owner sitting with the president, said in a typically glowing exchange about the proposal that she could not imagine â€œwhy someone would not think it would be a good thing.â€ù,Mr. Bush portrayed the plan as in keeping with his philosophy that it was governmentâ€™s role to enable people to become the â€œdecision maker,â€ù reminiscent of his reference to himself last year as â€œthe decider.â€ù",JIM RUTENBERG,"JAN. 26, 2007",Bush Pushes Health Care Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/washington/26bush.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Melbourne, Australia,CAN it be ethical for a young girl to be treated with hormones so she will remain below normal height and weight, to have her uterus removed and to have surgery on her breasts so they will not develop? Such treatment, applied to a profoundly intellectually disabled girl known only as Ashley, has led to criticism of Ashleyâ€™s parents, of the doctors who carried out the treatment, and of the ethics committee at Seattle Childrenâ€™s Hospital, which approved it.,Ashley is 9, but her mental age has never progressed beyond that of a 3-month-old. She cannot walk, talk, hold a toy or change her position in bed. Her parents are not sure she recognizes them. She is expected to have a normal lifespan, but her mental condition will never improve.,In a blog, Ashleyâ€™s parents explain that her treatment is not for their convenience but to improve her quality of life. If she remains small and light, they will be able to continue to move her around frequently and take her along when they go out with their other two children. The hysterectomy will spare her the discomfort of menstrual cramps, and the surgery to prevent the development of breasts, which tend to be large in her family, will make her more comfortable whether lying down or strapped across the chest in her wheelchair.,All this is plausible, even if it is also true that the line between improving Ashleyâ€™s life and making it easier for her parents to handle her scarcely exists, because anything that makes it possible for Ashleyâ€™s parents to involve her in family life is in her interest.,The objections to Ashleyâ€™s treatment take three forms familiar to anyone working in bioethics. First, some say Ashleyâ€™s treatment is â€œunnaturalâ€ù â€” a complaint that usually means little more than â€œYuck!â€ù One could equally well object that all medical treatment is unnatural, for it enables us to live longer, and in better health, than we naturally would. During most of human existence, children like Ashley were abandoned to become prey to wolves and jackals. Abandonment may be a â€œnaturalâ€ù fate for a severely disabled baby, but it is no better for that reason.,Second, some see acceptance of Ashleyâ€™s treatment as the first step down a slippery slope leading to widespread medical modification of children for the convenience of their parents. But the ethics committee that approved Ashleyâ€™s treatment was convinced that the procedures were in her best interest. Those of us who have not heard the evidence presented to the committee are in a weak position to contest its judgment.,In any case, the â€œbest interestâ€ù principle is the right test to use, and there is no reason that other parents of children with intellectual disabilities as profound as Ashleyâ€™s should not have access to similar treatments, if they will also be in the interest of their children. If there is a slippery slope here, the much more widespread use of drugs in â€œproblemâ€ù children who are diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder poses a far greater risk than attenuating growth in a small number of profoundly disabled children.,Finally, there is the issue of treating Ashley with dignity. A Los Angeles Times report on Ashleyâ€™s treatment began: â€œThis is about Ashleyâ€™s dignity. Everybody examining her case seems to agree at least about that.â€ù Her parents write in their blog that Ashley will have more dignity in a body that is healthier and more suited to her state of development, while their critics see her treatment as a violation of her dignity.,But we should reject the premise of this debate. As a parent and grandparent, I find 3-month-old babies adorable, but not dignified. Nor do I believe that getting bigger and older, while remaining at the same mental level, would do anything to change that.,Hereâ€™s where things get philosophically interesting. We are always ready to find dignity in human beings, including those whose mental age will never exceed that of an infant, but we donâ€™t attribute dignity to dogs or cats, though they clearly operate at a more advanced mental level than human infants. Just making that comparison provokes outrage in some quarters. But why should dignity always go together with species membership, no matter what the characteristics of the individual may be?,What matters in Ashleyâ€™s life is that she should not suffer, and that she should be able to enjoy whatever she is capable of enjoying. Beyond that, she is precious not so much for what she is, but because her parents and siblings love her and care about her. Lofty talk about human dignity should not stand in the way of children like her getting the treatment that is best both for them and their families.",PETER SINGER,"JAN. 26, 2007",A Convenient Truth,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/opinion/26singer.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25 â€” Amgen, the biotechnology company,  said Thursday that its , drug Aranesp increased the risk of death when used to treat certain , patients, a finding that will probably raise more questions about  it and  similar drugs.,Almost one million Americans a year receive prescriptions for Aranesp or one of two similar  products  â€”  Epogen from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson & Johnson.,Combined global sales of the three products, which increase the number of oxygen-carrying red cells in the blood, are around $10 billion.,But concern has been rising about the risks from overuse of the drugs. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November found that kidney disease patients treated aggressively with Procrit had a 34 percent higher risk of heart problems or death than those treated less aggressively.,An expert panel of doctors for the National Kidney Foundation is now assessing whether to change guidelines for how patients should be treated.,The latest trial was an attempt by Amgen to expand the use of Aranesp to a new group of patients:   those with anemia presumably caused by their cancer. Aranesp is now approved to treat anemia caused by cancer , but not by the cancer itself.,The 1,000 patients in the trial had active cancer, meaning they were not in remission, but were not getting chemotherapy or , therapy. The goal of the trial was to see if  Aranesp could reduce the need for blood transfusions, which anemic people frequently require.,The company found that  the drug did not reduce the need for transfusions compared with a  placebo, but did increase the number of deaths by the end of 16 weeks by a statistically significant amount.,Amgen, which did not provide any numerical results from the trial, said in a news release that in this particular population the â€œrisk/benefit ratio for Aranesp use is at best neutral and perhaps negative.â€ù,While such use of Aranesp is not approved, doctors do use it off label for that purpose. On a conference call Thursday with securities analysts, George Morrow, Amgenâ€™s executive vice president for global commercial operations, estimated that about 10 percent to 12 percent of Aranesp sales are for such â€œanemia of cancer.â€ù,Amgen announced the results of the trial along with its fourth-quarter earnings after the close of trading. The companyâ€™s shares fell by $2.37, or 3 percent, to $72.48 in after-hours trading, after closing in regular trading at $74.85, down 29 cents.,Several factors could have contributed to the sharesâ€™ decline besides the trial results. Amgenâ€™s earnings per share, excluding special items, while up 20 percent for the quarter, were below analyst estimates. The company also announced somewhat disappointing results in a clinical trial involving Vectibix, its recently approved colon cancer drug.,Still, some analysts on the conference call were clearly concerned that the Aranesp results could lead to a cutback in use of Aranesp and Epogen. The two drugs accounted for $6.6 billion, or 46 percent, of Amgenâ€™s $14.3 billion in 2006 revenue.,Amgen executives said that the trial was not intended to measure survival, so it was possible that the patients in the group that received Aranesp might have had a greater risk of dying to begin with than those in the placebo group. They said the results could not be extrapolated to other types of patients, like those getting chemotherapy or those with kidney disease.,Still, Kevin Sharer, Amgenâ€™s chief executive, conceded it was possible that the growing concerns over safety could lead to the drugsâ€™ being given a black-box warning, the strongest kind.,In 2003 Johnson & Johnson halted several studies of Procrit in cancer patients after they developed a higher-than-expected number of blood clots. In those trials, doctors were trying to treat the anemia more aggressively  in hopes that an increase in oxygen in the blood would increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.",ANDREW POLLACK,"JAN. 26, 2007",Amgen Finds Anemia Drug Holds Risks in Cancer Use,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/business/26amgen.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"GARDEN CITY, Jan. 24 â€” In 2000, 60 percent of the homes sold on , could be classified as â€œaffordableâ€ù for families earning up to $100,000 a year, under the old rule of thumb that buyers should spend no more than 2.5 times their income on places to live.,Last year, according to a new report, just 2 percent of the houses sold on Long Island were in that range for families with such earnings, which make up more than 60 percent of Long Island households.,The staggering drop over six years, according to the Long Island Index, an annual study of local economic and social trends, is the result of sluggish income growth and soaring housing costs, among other factors that have made the area increasingly unaffordable and driven many people away.,â€œIt took our breath away, that the change has been so dramatic in such a short period of time,â€ù said Ann Golob, director of the study, which is scheduled for official release Friday. The report, titled â€œIn a Tough Spot,â€ù puts it bluntly: â€œThe image of our region as a wealthy suburb is far from reality for a growing number of Long Islanders who are struggling to keep up with high and rising costs.â€ù,Though home prices have retreated in recent months, they remain at near-record levels, a bonanza for many homeowners, at least on paper. Those already living here are insulated from the entry barrier of high prices first-time buyers would face.,As the nationâ€™s first post-World War II suburb, Long Island flourished for decades as a middle-income alternative to New York City and is now home to nearly three million people.,Factors contributing to the affordability problem include the loss of higher-paying jobs and growth of lower-paying ones. A decade ago, wages here exceeded the national average by 16 percent; that has shrunk to 5 percent, and average pay has stagnated since 2003.,At the same time, the number of residents using food stamps rose 20 percent from 2000 to 2003, the most recent data available.,â€œNow our income advantage is disappearing, pushing some families near the breaking point,â€ù the report says. In the reportâ€™s survey of 808 residents, 58 percent complained of difficulty paying their monthly housing bills, while 54 percent said they were thinking of abandoning Long Island for lower-cost areas. Still, 82 percent called Long Island a good or excellent place to live, but only 48 percent said it was on the right track.,â€œI find it hard living on just a pension and Social Security, and I feel bad for the younger people,â€ù said John Schnitzler, a retired banker in East Meadow, N.Y. Still, Mr. Schnitzler said he enjoyed his three-bedroom home and being â€œ45 minutes from the city, 10 minutes to the beach, with the malls right here.â€ù,The report, sponsored by the Garden City-based Rauch Foundation, has been produced annually since 2004, with the advice of academic, civic, labor and other groups.,â€œTaken as a whole, Long Islandâ€™s story has been a success story,â€ù it says. â€œBut our continued success is now in doubt. We face significant problems, which yearly grow worse.â€ù,In a competitive economy, the report warned, Long Island will lose out to other areas unless it expands business and housing and reduces taxes. â€œIn an era of easy mobility, a region defers change at its peril,â€ù it said.,The 2.5-times-income formula for home prices is often ignored across the New York metropolitan area, where many residents spend disproportionately for shelter and shortchange other parts of their budget compared with other parts of the country.,The report did not adjust housing prices for changing mortgage rates, which were about two percentage points higher in 2000. But Ms. Golob noted that homeowners who bought then were able to cut carrying costs by refinancing as rates fell.,Beyond home prices and mortgage rates, an additional factor in the cost of housing is property taxes. They are notoriously high on Long Island and have jumped faster than inflation, the report said.,Many residents are under financial stress because of scant income growth, up 2 percent on average since 2000. Meanwhile, they are squeezed by the rising costs of taxes, heating, electricity and gasoline. Even for families with incomes above $110,000, 43 percent report difficulty in paying housing bills.,Long Island has yet to replace the aerospace and defense industry that once drove the economy, Ms. Golob said. Venture capital investment and federal research grants have fallen.,Research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has generated businesses. Its president, Dr. Bruce W. Stillman, said the island needs more cooperation by government, academia and business. Finding housing for researchers is so difficult that the lab assigns an administrator to help place them, sometimes in houses it bought for that purpose.,â€œPeople love their hometown of Long Island â€” they just canâ€™t afford it any more,â€ù the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, said in response to the report. â€œWe remodeled the Levitt houses, and now we have to remodel the suburban paradigm.â€ù",BRUCE LAMBERT,"JAN. 26, 2007","On Long Island, More Are Priced Out of the Housing Market",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/nyregion/26long.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ALBANY, Jan. 25 â€” Gov. , will preview his first executive budget in a speech on Friday afternoon, laying out his plan to rein in Medicaid and other health care spending, setting the stage for a battle with politically powerful health care providers and unions.,The governorâ€™s budget is widely expected to offer a sharp break from Albanyâ€™s spending practices of recent years, and Medicaid, at roughly $46 billion, is by far the largest part of the budget and the one many believe is most in need of rethinking.,The full details of the governorâ€™s proposal will be disclosed on Wednesday when he presents his executive budget to the Legislature, but among his proposals, according to people who have been briefed on the plan, will be revamping the way hospitals and nursing homes receive nearly $500 million a year for workforce recruitment and retention.,Those changes would address a formula that was worked out several years ago as part of a deal that involved Gov. George E. Pataki and S.E.I.U./1199, the powerful health care workersâ€™ union, in what some have criticized as a backdoor maneuver to grant raises to union workers. The overall amount is likely to be cut and the way the money is allocated revised. The Spitzer administration is seeking to ensure that Medicaid dollars are used for Medicaid patients and are not used as a general subsidy for health care providers.,The governor will also seek to cut or eliminate the annual inflation adjustment to Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes, which costs more than $300 million a year, a step Mr. Pataki attempted unsuccessfully in the past.,Mr. Spitzer will also continue to reorganize the Department of Health, in part by creating a new office of long-term care, as the administration looks for ways to drive down the cost of long-term care and chronic illness, and is likely to centralize the departmentâ€™s information technology efforts. Both plans were reported by Crainâ€™s New York Business on Thursday and confirmed by someone who has been briefed on the plan.,The governor will also continue efforts to get cheaper prices when the state buys drugs, possibly by centralizing purchasing in a single entity and also by seeking to change the way prices are negotiated with drug companies.,His proposals are likely to be received with hostility by health care providers and unions, coming on the heels of a state plan to close hospitals and the Bush administrationâ€™s proposal for new cuts in health care.,â€œItâ€™s going to be a battle in Washington on trying not to lose that money, and a battle in Albany not to lose that money,â€ù said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. â€œHospitals by and large break even in New York, so any money that is extracted is like pulling teeth.â€ù,â€œWeâ€™ve extended our hand to the executive branch,â€ù he added. â€œWeâ€™ll see how it goes.â€ù,Mr. Spitzer also wants to push through a package of proposals to fight health care fraud that he supported as attorney general. One of the changes would expand the Martin Act to encompass health care, a statute he used to great effect to pursue securities fraud. Such proposals are likely to be taken up outside the budget process, however.,Mr. Spitzerâ€™s first budget is expected to demonstrate that he will try to take a more fiscally conservative tack than did George E. Pataki in the later years of his Republican administration, though Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, will be dealing with the same legislative leaders.,Paul Francis, the new budget director, said in a recent interview that he was struck that many subsidies were â€œnot directly related to patient care,â€ù adding, â€œAt the end of the day, the government can only afford to do so many of those without raising taxes.â€ù,The new deputy secretary for public safety, Michael A. L. Balboni, a former state senator, said in a recent interview that Mr. Francis told him the budget would be â€œtighter than youâ€™ve ever seen.â€ù,Steep cuts to health care could set up a fight pitting the governor against the Legislature, hospitals and powerful unions like S.E.I.U./1199. A spokeswoman for 1199 declined to comment, but the union could be a troublesome foe for the Spitzer administration because of its considerable political contributions and close ties to the Republicans who control the Senate. The union has endorsed a Republican, Maureen Oâ€™Connell, in her bid to fill Mr. Balboniâ€™s Long Island Senate seat in a special election next month.,The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, has said â€œthe Senate will not support gratuitous cuts to health care.â€ù,Mr. Spitzerâ€™s team is likely to need the health care cuts as it struggles with a number of competing agendas â€” reining in overall spending while substantially increasing funds for education and lowering property taxes, and also extending health care coverage to all children in the state.,â€œHistorically, the first year of a governorâ€™s term is the year where you make the toughest decisions, so everyoneâ€™s preparing themselves for what will be a very tight budget,â€ù said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. â€œLook at his promises.

"TRENTON, Jan. 25 â€” The state agency set up to ensure that municipalities meet court-mandated requirements to provide low- and moderate-income housing has used faulty methods in calculating housing needs in the state, a Superior Court appellate panel ruled on Thursday.,A result of the flawed approach was that the agency, the Council on Affordable Housing, underestimated the number of units needed statewide by as much as 100,000, the court said. The agency used outdated studies and assumptions generally applied to housing markets that were not being borne out in ,, the court said.,In a unanimous decision, the three-judge panel gave the state agency six months to correct the flaws highlighted in the 127-page ruling. In the meantime, the affordable-housing plans of some 300 communities that are pending before the agency will be put on hold.,The ruling grew out of a 2004 lawsuit brought by the Fair Share Housing Center, a nonprofit developer of low-income housing, and state buildersâ€™ groups, who asserted that a number of agency rules ran counter to a series of landmark court decisions on zoning.,Those decisions, stemming from litigation dating to 1971 and known as the Mount Laurel rulings, from the New Jersey town where the case originated, struck down local zoning ordinances that barred affordable and rental housing for the poor. The rulings found that municipalities and regions of the state had an obligation to provide for such housing. In response, the state created the Council on Affordable Housing to enforce local housing laws and work toward meeting goals. The council is now overseen by Susan Bass Levin, the commissioner of the State Department of Community Affairs.,â€œThe court sent a clear message to Susan Bass Levin and C.O.A.H. that itâ€™s time to stop evading New Jerseyâ€™s responsibility to provide affordable housing,â€ù said Peter J. Oâ€™Connor, the executive director of Fair Share Housing and one of the lawyers in the original Mount Laurel case.,Ms. Bass Levin defended the agencyâ€™s methodology Thursday, saying that it promoted not only affordable housing, but also sound planning.,It was not immediately clear whether the state agency would appeal the ruling to the stateâ€™s highest court. As for the six-month deadline given to the agency by the court, Ms. Bass Levin said she feared that the construction of affordable housing would be slowed while the building of market-rate housing continued at a brisk pace. Such building, she said, could increase density and consume land that otherwise could have been used to build lower-income units.,One of the plaintiffs in the case, the New Jersey Builders Association, called on Gov. Jon S. Corzine to direct the agency to meet with his group and the Fair Share Housing Center so that together they could devise new rules and methods. Doing so, the group said, would prevent further court battles and speed the process that would put affordable housing projects back on local agendas.",RONALD SMOTHERS,"JAN. 26, 2007",Court Finds State Agency Miscalculated Housing Need,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/nyregion/26housing.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Microsoft yesterday reported strong sales for its latest quarter and a profit that slightly surpassed Wall Street estimates, but its financial results were muddled by the late arrival of important new products.,Sales rose 6 percent in the quarter ended in December, to $12.5 billion. But the company said that showing would have been much stronger if it had not deferred $1.64 billion in revenue as  a result of delays in the latest versions of  its mainstay products, Windows Vista  and Office 2007. They will be introduced next week.,Without the one-time move, sales would have been 20 percent higher than in the quarter a year earlier, the chief financial officer, Christopher P. Liddell, said.,The quarterly results â€œexceeded our expectations across the board,â€ù including healthy sales of PC software, Mr. Liddell said.,In after-hours trading yesterday, Microsoftâ€™s shares were up as much as 58 cents, at $31.03. In the regular session, they had slipped 64 cents, to $30.45.,Microsoftâ€™s video game business surged in the quarter, as revenue grew 75 percent, to $2.96 billion, helped by strong year-end sales of its , 360 console and hit games like Gears of War.,Sales of server software used in corporate data centers also continued to sell strongly, with revenue up 17 percent, to $2.85 billion. Operating profit rose 35 percent, to more than $1 billion. The server group â€” operating systems, databases and back-end programs for e-mail systems â€” has become a third strong business for Microsoft, in addition to the lucrative Windows and Office.,â€œThis is a pretty strong quarter with nearly all of the businesses contributing,â€ù said Charles di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.,Net income fell 28 percent, to $2.63 billion, from $3.65 billion in the period a year earlier, with the fall-off attributable to the deferring of revenue.,To help the personal computer industry cope with the product delay, Microsoft offered free or discount coupons for upgrades to Windows Vista and Office 2007. That allowed PC makers to sell new computers late last year with the promise that users would be able to upgrade to the new Microsoft products, and prevent PC sales from stalling.,Microsoft did not recognize the Windows or Office revenue from those machines until users purchased the upgrade coupons or decided to use the older software.,The accounting treatment trimmed 11 cents a share from earnings in the December quarter, leaving them at 26 cents a share. That was 3 cents a share higher than the Wall Street consensus of 23 cents, as compiled by Thomson First Call. Microsoft had announced the coupon program in October, and said that about $1.5 billion in revenue would be deferred. The higher $1.64 billion figure reflected stronger PC sales than Microsoft anticipated.,The revenue deferred from the December quarter will be recognized this period. The deferral, analysts say, is simply an accounting shift from one quarter to the next, adding about 12 cents a share in the current quarter.,Microsoft said it expected revenue this quarter of $13.7 billion to $14 billion, and earnings of 45 cents or 46 cents a share, in line with analystsâ€™ expectations. For the 2007 fiscal year, which ends in June, Microsoft said its revenue would reach $50.2 billion to $50.7 billion, while profit would be $1.45 to $1.47 a share.,The company is betting heavily on the consumer electronics business for future growth, and late last year it  introduced a digital media player, Zune, which competes with Appleâ€™s ,. But Microsoftâ€™s consumer entertainment and devices unit contributes no profits yet, losing $289 million in the quarter.,Microsoftâ€™s online business also remained a weak spot, struggling especially in Internet searches. In the quarter, Microsoft lost market share in searching, with Google widening its lead against Yahoo and Microsoft. â€œWeâ€™re clearly not happy with that,â€ù  Mr. Liddell, the chief financial officer, said. â€œBut we continue to take a long-term view and we continue to invest.â€ù,Online services revenue, which includes display advertising on the Web and search-linked ads, rose 5 percent in the quarter, to $624 million.

"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25 â€” For decades, tourists deposited themselves at one of the most famous intersections in America â€” Hollywood and Vine â€” and looked around in puzzlement, wondering what exactly they were supposed to be seeing.,The surrounding Hollywood neighborhood had fallen into such miserable disrepair that its main consumers were people seeking drugs or tattoos. Many entertainment companies were long gone. Crime was rampant, incomes were depressed,  and people who labored in the industry that gave the neighborhood its fame were nowhere to be found.,But in a few weeks, work will begin on a luxury hotel and a collection of $1 million condominiums at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, joining a skyline of condos and trendy new hamburger and sushi outposts rising among the mid-20th-century architecture.,That  Los Angeles neighborhood, which had been promised a comeback for a good 40 years, seems to have finally achieved it, a cross-continent bookend to the transformation of Times Square in New York, with one key difference: Los Angeles residents, not just tourists, have found reasons to go there and live there.,â€œHollywood is a testament to peopleâ€™s desire to live in places with some sense of history and a sense of place,â€ù said David Malmuth, a developer who brought the Kodak Theater,  home to the Academy Awards,  to Hollywood and also oversaw the renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater in Times Square.,In the last several years alone, more than $2 billion has been spent on projects in the neighborhood, including mixed-use retail and apartment complexes and new schools and museums.  Many urban planning experts see something other than a confluence of low interest rates, a tight housing market and developers with a gleam in their eyes.,The Hollywood renaissance represents a potential future of much more of Los Angeles, a sprawling, horizontal city where vertical, dense and at least somewhat walkable neighborhoods with public transportation are increasingly in vogue.,â€œIt is a comeback that shows there is some demand for a more urban way of life,â€ù said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, chairwoman of the Department of Urban Planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. â€œIt is a comeback that is based not only on entertainment and commercial spaces, but mixed use and housing, at the same time the city is building its rail service.â€ù,Among the many celebrated neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the 25 square miles of Hollywood have long stood out.,Outside of the Walk of Fame, the circular Capitol Records building and other historically sumptuous landmarks, the neighborhood is a richly diverse community of 222,694 people â€” from the wealthy residents peering out at the world from the hills above Hollywood proper, to the middle- and lower-income inhabitants of the streets below.,Like a great old house, the bones of Hollywood remained mostly untouched in its down years by large-scale development and the more unfortunate inclinations of contemporary urban planners. Yet years of disinvestment in the area, led by the fleeing of the movie studios, took its toll.,â€œIt just needed a huge surge of capital investment to bring those buildings back,â€ù said Christi Van Cleve, a partner at Roschen Van Cleve Architects, which has restored several buildings in the neighborhood.,Proponents of the new Hollywood have a data point they love to trot out: in the 1980s, the average stay on Hollywood Boulevard was a depressing 28 minutes, or about the time it can take to find a parking spot in the thriving nearby city of West Hollywood. People slept in the streets, and a drug trade prospered among boarded up historic sites.,By the early 1990s, three major projects proposed for the area had fallen apart. Subway construction was just beginning, leaving a sinkhole in the street and traffic nightmares all around. The Los Angeles riots and an economic recession had done little to brighten the hopes of Hollywood, and private equity wanted no part of it.,Then, in 1993, â€œJackie Goldberg came along,â€ù said Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, referring to the Los Angeles city councilwoman representing Hollywood at the time who went on to become a state legislator. â€œShe said, â€˜Nothing is going to happen here until we address some of the basic problems,â€™ â€ù Mr. Gubler said.,The Community Redevelopment Agency, a city-sponsored revitalization effort, had begun to pay for street improvements, fixing up facades on buildings. Next came a police foot patrol paid for largely by the transit authority.,In 1995, Ms. Goldberg and the chamber staff decided to create a business improvement district along six blocks on Hollywood Boulevard. The next year, the district was established with $600,000 raised through business owners, who had their trepidations. They had heard the â€œHollywood is backâ€ù storyline before.,â€œIt was a challenge,â€ù said Mr. Gubler, who at one point nearly stalked the owner of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel to get the last signature on a petition needed to get it all done. The hotel â€” founded in 1927 by a syndicate of Hollywood stars like Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, and home to the first Academy Awards â€” had as much at stake as any luminary.,By 1997, thanks to armed guards, crime in the area had dropped over 50 percent. â€œThat is when we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel,â€ù Mr. Gubler said.,At the same time, Mr. Malmuth, the developer, took an interest in Hollywood. He and others focused on the corner of Hollywood and Highland, a major intersection ripe for commercial development. Mr. Malmuth joined a development firm that committed to a mixed-use project that would become the home of the Academy Awards ceremony.,The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had been sniffing around for new options for the Oscars, embraced the idea of a live theater surrounded by retailers and other tenants.,â€œWhen I took this into the board of governors, I thought it was going to be a hard sell,â€ù said Bruce Davis, the executive director of the academy. â€œAt that time, Hollywood definitely had a seedy reputation.â€ù,The Hollywood and Highland project, first proposed at a cost of $150 million in 1998, came to fruition in 2001 at a cost closer to $600 million. Slowly, a steady stream of interest among other commercial developers followed, and nightlife and restaurants â€” the dual forces of urban renewal â€” came too, as did the final piece, new housing.,Now cruising east on Hollywood Boulevard toward a sea of glittering lights, the sleazy motels and tattoo parlors begin to give way to Starbucks and a Virgin Megastore, and the hopelessly chic Geisha House, a giant emporium of oyster shooters and sashimi â€œigloo style,â€ù and the sort of people who spend a good chunk of their week in Pilates classes.,In a nod to the cornerâ€™s glamorous past, there will be an 11-story W Hotel at Hollywood and Vine. It was there that the famous Brown Derby Restaurant opened in 1929, and for years remained the watering hole for studio executives and â€œthe talentâ€ù streaming out of nearby film studios â€” more Spago than Spago today.,The restaurant fell to seed like much the neighborhood in the 1970s, and closed in 1985. In a depressing coda, most of the building burned in 1987, and it was demolished in 1994. The new project at the intersection, expected to open in 2009, will include the 300-room W Hotel and a 14-story luxury condominium tower. Across the street, a converted office building has sold out its luxury condos, including one to Charlize Theron, said Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles City Council speaker whose district includes Hollywood.,â€œPeople are seeing stars here again,â€ù said Mr. Garcetti, who helped pass an ordinance to increase housing in the area. Developers creating apartment and condo complexes with city money are required to set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents, and a few sites offer more, like one along two blocks at Hollywood and Western, in colorful block buildings that look like a Mondrian painting.,But displacement of the residents who stood by Hollywood at its worst â€” the seamy underbelly of neighborhood renewal â€” is no doubt happening.,â€œThe more they put up big flashy apartments, the more difficult it is to make ends meet,â€ù said Tita Stallings, who has lived in Hollywood for 20 years. â€œAs a low-income single parent, it scares the hell out of me.â€ù,Larry Gross, the executive director of the Coalition for Economic Survival, a tenantsâ€™ rights organization, estimates that at least 1,000 units of low-income housing have been lost to development over the last five years.,Mr. Garcetti said he has struggled against this tide, requiring developers, for instance, to offer jobs to local residents and pay higher wages, and pushing for more affordable housing. â€œWe donâ€™t want the people who laid the groundwork here to get pushed out,â€ù he said.,The Gap is in Hollywood now, which may just about say it all. And the subway is now open for business, ferrying people in and out of the area and setting the foundation of what may become a new Los Angeles, with fewer cars and more urban living.",JENNIFER STEINHAUER,"JAN. 26, 2007","Hollywood, the Sequel: Less Shabby, More Chic",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/us/26hollywood.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scientists studying stroke patients are reporting today that an injury to a specific part of the brain, near the ear, can instantly and permanently break a smoking habit. People with the injury who stopped smoking found that their bodies, as one man put it, â€œforgot the urge to smoke.â€ù,The finding, which appears in the journal Science, is based on a small study. But experts say it is likely to alter the course of addiction research, pointing researchers toward new ideas for treatment.,While no one is suggesting brain injury as a solution for addiction, the finding suggests that therapies might focus on the insula, a prune-size region under the frontal lobes that is thought to register gut feelings and is apparently a critical part of the network that sustains addictive behavior.,Previous research on addicts focused on regions of the cortex involved in thinking and decision making. But while those regions are involved in maintaining habits, the new study suggests that they are not as central as the insula is.,The study did not examine dependence on alcohol, cocaine or other substances. Yet smoking is at least as hard to quit as any other habit, and it probably involves the same brain circuits, experts said. Most smokers who manage to quit do so only after repeated attempts, and the craving for cigarettes usually lasts for years, if not a lifetime.,â€œThis is the first time weâ€™ve shown anything like this, that damage to a specific brain area could remove the problem of addiction entirely,â€ù said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which financed the study, along with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. â€œItâ€™s absolutely mind-boggling.â€ù,Others cautioned that scientists still knew little about the widely distributed neural networks involved in sustaining habits.,â€œOne has to be careful not to extrapolate too much based on brain injuries to whatâ€™s going on in all addictive behavior, in healthy brains,â€ù said Dr. Martin Paulus, a psychiatric researcher at the University of California, San Diego, and the San Diego V.A. Medical Center. Still, Dr. Paulus said, the study â€œopens up a whole new way to think about addiction.â€ù,The researchers, from the University of Iowa and the University of Southern California, examined 32 former smokers, all of whom had suffered a brain injury. The men and women were lucid enough to answer a battery of questions about their habits, and to rate how hard it was to quit and the strength of their subsequent urges to smoke.,They all had smoked at least five cigarettes a day for two years or more, and 16 of them said they had quit with ease, losing their cravings entirely.,The researchers performed M.R.I. scans on all of the patientsâ€™ brains to specify the location and extent of each injury.,They found that the 16 who had quit easily were far more likely to have an injury to their insula than to any other area. The researchers found no association between a diminished urge to smoke and injuries to other regions of the brain, including tissue surrounding the insula.,â€œThereâ€™s a whole neural circuit critical to maintaining addiction, but if you knock out this one area, it appears to wipe out the behavior,â€ù said Dr. Antoine Bechara, a senior author of the new paper, who is a neuroscientist at the Brain and Creativity Institute at U.S.C. His co-authors were Dr. Hanna Damasio, also of U.S.C., and Nasir Naqvi and David Rudrauf of the University of Iowa.,The patientsâ€™ desire to eat, by contrast, was intact. This suggests, the authors wrote, that the insula is critical for behaviors whose bodily effects become pleasurable because they are learned, like cigarette smoking.,The insula, for years a wallflower of brain anatomy, has emerged as a region of interest based in part on recent work by Dr. Antonio Damasio, a neurologist and director of the Brain and Creativity Institute. The insula has widely distributed connections, both in the thinking cortex above, and down below in subcortical areas, like the brain stem, that maintain heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature, the bodyâ€™s primal survival systems.,Based on his studies and othersâ€™, Dr. Damasio argues that the insula, in effect, maps these signals from the bodyâ€™s physical plant, and integrates them so the conscious brain can interpret them as a coherent emotion.,The system works from the bottom up. First, the body senses cues in the outside world, and responds. The heart rate might elevate at the sight of a strangerâ€™s angry face, for example; other muscles might relax in response to a pleasant whiff of smoke.,All of this happens instantaneously and unconsciously, Dr. Damasio said â€” until the insula integrates the information and makes it readable to the conscious regions of the brain.,â€œIn a sense itâ€™s not surprising that the insula is an important part of this circuit maintaining addiction, because we realized some years ago that it was going to be a critical platform for emotions,â€ù Dr. Damasio said in a telephone interview. â€œIt is on this platform that we first anticipate pain and pleasure, not just smoking but eating chocolate, drinking a glass of wine, all of it.â€ù,This explains why cravings are so physical, and so hard to shake, he said: they have taken hold in the visceral reaches of the body well before they are even conscious.,Other researchers have found that the insula is activated in unpleasant circumstances, like a bad smell or the anticipation of a painful shock, or even in shoppers when they see a price that seems too high. Damage to the insula is associated with slight impairment of some social function.,While antismoking treatments based on the new findings are still a long way off, the authors suggest that therapies that replicate some of the physical sensations of the habit, like inhalers, could be useful.,And at least two previous studies suggest that people can reduce the sensation of pain by learning to modulate the activity in an area of their brain.,In experiments, healthy volunteers watched real-time M.R.I. images of a cortical region linked strongly to pain sensation and learned to moderate that neural activity, reducing the pain they felt from a heated instrument pressed to their palms. The same kind of technique could be tried with addicts watching images of their insulas.,â€œThe question is, Can you learn to deactivate the insula?â€ù Dr. Volkow said. â€œNow, everybodyâ€™s going to be looking at the insula.â€ù",BENEDICT CAREY,"JAN. 26, 2007","In Clue to Addiction, Brain Injury Halts Smoking",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/science/26brain.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Thursdayâ€™s column you had the chance to pick Westâ€™s opening lead against a small slam. Now you can select something against a grand slam, seven spades. What would be your choice?,On Thursday Harold Rosenson of West Palm Beach, Fla., led a low trump from queen-doubleton against a small slam. This imaginative choice did not generate a trump trick, but it defeated the contract when declarer failed to play double-dummy. Any side-suit lead would have made declarerâ€™s task easy.,That column resulted in a small flurry of e-mail messages. During an open trial in the â€™70s, someone led low from queen-doubleton of trump against a grand slam. After dummy played low, his partner would not put up the king from king-doubleton, so the grand made.,In the â€™80s a player underled king-doubleton of trump against a grand slam, confident the ace was on his left. There was bad news, good news and bad news. Dummy did not have the trump ace; it was nestling in declarerâ€™s hand â€” ugh. But partner had queen-doubleton of trump â€” aah. After dummy played low, so did third hand â€” ugh, ugh.,And another player in the â€™80s underled king-doubleton of trump against a grand slam. There was good news, better news and best news. The ace was in the dummy. Partner had queen-doubleton. And after dummy played low, partner eventually put up the queen to hold the trick. Attempts to find these full layouts have failed â€” memories get hazy over the decades.,These deals do highlight an advantage of Roman Key Card Blackwood, which uncovers not only the four aces but also the trump king and trump queen. These â€œno-playâ€ù grand slams are now avoided.,The diagramed deal occurred during the 1977 Bermuda Bowl world team championship in Manila. It was described in â€œTrump Leadsâ€ù by Dr. George Rosenkranz (Devyn Press, 1986). Northâ€™s three-spade rebid was forcing. South, not playing Roman Key Card Blackwood, blasted into seven spades.,If South had been using that convention, he would have known that the trump queen was missing and presumably would have settled for six spades. But there is a strong case for bidding seven anyway. It has always been traditional to lead a trump against a grand slam. So if West leads a trump, it picks up the queen for you. And if West leads a side suit, declarer plays him for the trump queen.,South would presumably have done that here â€” except that the American expert Mike Passell did lead a low trump. Declarer, thinking East must have the spade queen,  called for dummyâ€™s ten, taking the trick. Then he cashed dummyâ€™s ace â€” and ruefully nodded his head when East discarded.,Presumably West has led from two or three low trumps, or from four to the queen. Perhaps South should have led dummyâ€™s low trump at Trick 2. If East follows suit, South puts in his nine â€” an interesting way to play in a grand slam. But when East discards, declarer can win with his king and finesse on the way back through West.,In the other room, Passellâ€™s teammates stopped in six spades, so his team gained 14 international match points instead of losing 11.",PHILLIP ALDER,"JAN. 27, 2007","Defending a Slam Again, Only This Time Itâ€™s Grand",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/crosswords/bridge/27card.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The saxophonist Greg Osby is one of the most specific writers and arrangers in jazz. He makes small-group music that can be aslant with odd or long meter, and serenely played; itâ€™s not battering or superexpressive, but glows within its own tight structure. Always, he comes with a grid.,But the group under his name at the Jazz Standard this week, Greg Osby and the Organization, is more casual.

Mr. Osby is deferential toward her, and more willing than usual to wing it. In Thursdayâ€™s late set, for all intents and purposes, she was as much the boss as he was.,Ms. Pitts began the set on piano and, with Mr. Osby alone, played â€œBody and Soul.â€ù She allowed a lot of open space into her playing, and she transferred some of the organâ€™s inherent drama to the piano: she presented ideas one after the other, sequentially and charismatically, swelling and quieting. Mr. Osby picked around the famous melody subversively, running parallel to Ms. Pitts, taking wide harmonic routes around the horn without going dissonant.,They were joined by the guitarist Paul Bollenback and the drummer Gene Jackson â€” crisp, clean-sounding musicians â€” and they started a version of Milt Jacksonâ€™s blues â€œBagsâ€™ Groove,â€ù with Ms. Pitts on organ. The Hammond B-3 is a high-expression machine: if you are not riding the volume pedal and the vibrato control, you are not really playing it.,Ms. Pitts wrung them out, going from a muted tinkle to a rippling, volcanic roar. (There was visual theater in the solo as well: the sight of Ms. Pitts, amiable and grandmotherly, wincing and shaking her head, magicked by her own sounds.),When she finished her solo, she seemed to leave a crater behind her. And Mr. Osby, in emergency mode, started to sound more outgoing, working blues phrases and sweet, high-register shouts into his playing, channeling bits of Cannonball Adderley.,Mr. Bollenback, for his part, is fluent in 1960s-style organ-jazz guitar accompaniment as an almost classical style: the muted tone; the short, fast runs; and subtle slides. His response to this challenge, and all those that followed, was to play faster and more smoothly, using sweep-picking and extended harmony.,Warming to her work, Ms. Pitts began adding extras to songs, directing arrangements and shaping the set. She sang an introduction to â€œAutumn Leaves,â€ù elongating phrases as she liked; she added a cadenza in that same song, interpolating Handelâ€™s â€œHallelujahâ€ù chorus; she transformed â€œCaravanâ€ù into â€œAmazing Grace.â€ù,Ms. Pitts had personality to spread around, and there was nothing to be done about it: the rest of the band sounded narrower in her presence.",BEN RATLIFF,"JAN. 27, 2007",A Saxophonist Known for New Ideas Meets an Organist From the Old School,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/music/27osby.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œI hate publishing!â€ù Alfred Tennyson complained as he assembled his poems for London publication in 1842. Among his gripes was having to chase down pirated American versions of his verse, while trying to earn his keep from books and magazines. But those earnings came far more easily to him than to todayâ€™s poets. â€œIn Memoriamâ€ù sold 25,000 copies in England in less than two years; in 1864  â€œEnoch Ardenâ€ù sold 40,000 copies in just a few weeks.,None of the other authors represented in â€œVictorian Bestsellers,â€ù a new exhibition at the Morgan Library & Museum, had much reason for complaint, either. Organized by John Bidwell, who oversees the Morganâ€™s department of printed books and bindings, this exhibition of manuscripts, first editions, drawings, posters and prints is not a typical bibliophilic display of rare esoterica. Indeed, its focus is rare ,: these books publicly erupted onto the 19th-century English scene. Apart from the Bibleâ€™s privileged monopoly as a must-read, these best sellers were among the first cultural products for a broad public, breaking down boundaries of class and caste; they also created new audiences, inspiring spinoffs and extravagant commercial enterprise.,Some of these best sellers are now barely known, like George du Maurierâ€™s 1894 novel, â€œTrilbyâ€ù â€” the exhibition opens with a copy of the original manuscript purchased by Pierpont Morgan just after it was published. â€œTrilbyâ€ù first appeared in Harperâ€™s New Monthly Magazine, raising circulation by 100,000, and later inspired a play, a Warner Brothers film and the once renowned Trilby hat.,Other best sellers remain literary landmarks. After Charles Dickensâ€™s â€œPosthumous Papers of the Pickwick Clubâ€ù began appearing in monthly installments in March 1836, its press run increased from 1,000 copies for the first part to 40,000 for the finale in October 1837. By 1879 the full novel had sold 800,000 copies and had transformed British publishing.,The exhibition is a bit constricted by taking Queen Victoriaâ€™s reign (1837-1901) as its domain, since, as it acknowledges, the prime example of a best-selling author was Sir Walter Scott, whose 1819 â€œIvanhoeâ€ù (part of the authorâ€™s manuscript is on display here) sold 10,000 copies in two weeks.,But this show â€” suggestive and alluring, with its sampling of the Morganâ€™s riches â€” demonstrates that it was during the latter part of the 19th century that the appetite of a growing public was institutionalized, and that authors and publishers knowingly worked for large sales, perfecting new forms of packaging for print.,The monthly pamphlet, the 20-installment novel, the inexpensive chapbook, the cheap â€œyellowbacksâ€ù with their cheap thrills, the â€œpenny dreadfulsâ€ù with even cheaper expectations â€” these were the forms given literary fantasy to suit the mercurial marketplace.,Pride of place went to the â€œthree-deckerâ€ù â€” the standard for much 19th-century publishing â€” a three-volume edition that would be purchased by circulating libraries, but was generally too expensive for most private readers. (There is a bookcase of three-deckers shown here.) Yet even after such books were repackaged for middle class customers, sales figures donâ€™t give a full count of audiences. Publications of all kinds were often read aloud to groups, a practice shared by varied social classes.,So the number of a bookâ€™s â€œreadersâ€ù was some unknown multiple of its sales. One 1802 illustration by James Gillray at the exhibition shows four well-dressed women crowded around a small table, rapt in suspense as one, leaning forward in shocked surprise, reads aloud from a best-selling anthology.,â€œThe English Common Reader: A Social History of the Mass Reading Public, 1800-1900,â€ù Richard D. Altickâ€™s pioneering history of the book (which also compiled many of the sales statistics I am citing), describes a charwoman who never missed going to a monthly tea at a local snuff shop where the landlord read aloud the latest issue of Dickensâ€™s â€œDombey and Son.â€ù,Very little else could have lured both humble charwoman and haughty dowager. And the booksâ€™ power only grew as technological advances brought down the price of paper, literacy increased with mandatory schooling, and distribution networks expanded with railroad lines. Books were manufactured with an eye on quantity: the exhibition includes an etched steel plate for Hablot K. Browneâ€™s frontispiece of â€œDavid Copperfield,â€ù,the steel allowing mass printing with little wear.,The drama surrounding the book began to mirror the drama within the book. No longer just a private object for learned appreciation or ecclesiastical devotion, it had a life in the public sphere, where its fortunes were played out to melodramatic effect. The book trade had its heroes and villains, hacks and geniuses. There are crusaders here too, like Anna Sewell; her 1877 â€œBlack Beautyâ€ù was pirated by the American Humane Education Society and given away â€” a copy is in this show â€” the cover heralding it as â€œThe â€˜Uncle Tomâ€™s Cabinâ€™ of the horse.â€ù As for the â€œUncle Tomâ€™s Cabinâ€ù of American slavery, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, shown here in an 1852 first edition that sold out in days, it sold a million copies in its first year in London and the United States.,The stakes were high: during the late 1860s, the publishers of a British magazine, â€œSaint Pauls,â€ù on display here, were counting on Anthony Trollope to help them get the 25,000 subscribers they needed to break even, but Trollope, as the editor and star of the publication â€” a typical marketing and editorial role for successful authors â€” could manage to sell only 10,000 copies with his serialized novel â€œPhineas Finn.â€ù,A lesser author, Charles Lever, triumphed with his first novel, â€œHarry Lorrequer,â€ù in 1839; it was re-released as an inexpensive yellowback in 1875, which here looks literally like pulp fiction. Lever futilely kept trying to match that novelâ€™s success. Instead he went into debt and almost singlehandedly drove away readers from Dickensâ€™s own magazine, All the Year Round, when his new work was featured there. Dickens, the exhibition tells us, â€œhad to come to the rescue with a new feature, â€˜Great Expectations,â€™ to win back the readers that Lever had lost.â€ù,Books also took on a guiding role in this bewildering new world of self-creation and urban life. In earlier eras, Isabella Mary Beetonâ€™s â€œBook of Household Managementâ€ù (1861) would most likely have served few readers; instead, the exhibition notes, it became â€œperhaps the most influential cookbook of all time,â€ù selling 640,000 copies before the end of the century. There is also an inscribed 1866 copy here of Samuel Smilesâ€™s  â€œSelf-Help; With Illustrations of Character, Conduct, and Perseverance,â€ù a volume that sold more than 250,000 copies between 1859 and 1905, and gave its name to an entire genre.,The exhibition points out: â€œThe literary formulas and publishing strategies perfected in this period still play a role in the business of best sellers.â€ù,That gives a certain urgency and currency to these quietly presented objects. During the Victorian era, the fantastical and Gothic adventures of earlier novels were translated from the supernatural into the social: it was within society itself that villainy and redemption was to be found. The reader or listener was, like the book, in a new setting, possessed by a need to comprehend the vastly changed circumstances of modernity, trying to map out a path in a world where all social strata were being transformed.,The Victorian reader was picking up these books not as a congregant or as a student, but as a , finding echoes of personal experience and seeking new forms of guidance. Today the world still overwhelms; the only difference is that now books are not the only medium promising redemption.",EDWARD ROTHSTEIN,"JAN. 27, 2007",Best-Seller Big Bang: When Words Started Off to Market,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/27vict.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why a Russian string orchestra spent two hours playing Japanese and Chinese music at Zankel Hall on Thursday has one obvious answer. Everyone is across the street from everyone else these days and sends instant cultural messages back and forth. Differences remain. If Toru Takemitsuâ€™s movie music is the last word in restrained elegance, the Moscow Soloists executed it sounding like 17 fine young performers who sort of play together.,Another answer is that everybody seemed to like the music. So did I, with the exception of Hikaru Hayashiâ€™s Concerto for Viola and Strings, an earnest yet largely uneventful attempt at European postwar angst that stretched out to the point of tedium.,Mr. Takemitsuâ€™s  â€œNostalghiaâ€ù for violin and strings and  â€œThree Film Scoresâ€ù hung back seductively with a kind of aristocratic reserve.  â€œNostalghiaâ€ù uses harmonics and sliding notes in a way that allows European instruments to  at least hint at traditional Japanese musicâ€™s dips and wiggles between what we like to think of as fixed pitches.,The  â€œFilm Scoresâ€ù â€”  â€œMusic of Training and Rest,â€ù â€œFuneral Musicâ€ù and  â€œWaltzâ€ù â€”  raise the Hollywood sound studio and the Broadway orchestra pit to a higher level. The divided strings and add-on chords revisit Joan Crawford and John Garfield in black and white. Syncopation and bluesy distortions hear America acutely while softening the intentional crudities.,Tan Dunâ€™s Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa was a harder sell, but then I was a happy customer. Wu Man played the pipa, a kind of mandolin, with great style, and discreet amplification created a balance between potentially smothering partners onstage. The composer offers a long list of entertainments: stomps, yips, yells and sighs from the players, pizzicato and hand-slaps to imitate the dry resonance of Eastern instruments and pounding repetitive figures.,The music has a nice way of unexpectedly changing the subject: at one point into a tuneup session (which the unwashed of the West often accuse Eastern music of sounding like), at another, into an accumulating overlay from Bachâ€™s  â€œWell-Tempered Clavier.â€ù,Yuri Bashmet, the orchestraâ€™s founder, plays both viola and violin very well, and like most instrumentalists in his trade, he likes to conduct too. That skill begins at least with finding good musicians, which he certainly had here.",BERNARD HOLLAND,"JAN. 27, 2007",Chinese Pipa Joins Russian Strings,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/27solo.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bob Seger is 61, with gray hair and glasses. But he still goes to work in a T-shirt and bluejeans.,On Thursday night he was working at Madison Square Garden. He was headlining his first tour in a decade, following through on last yearâ€™s release of â€œFace the Promiseâ€ù (Capitol), his first new album since 1995. Fans happily sang along with songs from his hit-making heyday, 30 years ago; a few even held up cigarette lighters, not illuminated cellphones, during ballads. They were delighted to hear that, grizzled or not, Mr. Seger has hardly changed. He didnâ€™t sing his hit â€œStill the Sameâ€ù; he didnâ€™t have to.,His voice is still a robust, husky baritone with proud roots in Detroit soul music, and his songs, old and new, are heartland rock with ringing chords and a stolid  beat, made for arenas. A new one declares, â€œSimplicity, it works for me.â€ù,Important members of his Silver Bullet Band â€” Alto Reed on saxophones, Chris Campbell on bass, Craig Frost on keyboards â€” have been with him for decades. Mr. Seger was never the most athletic performer, but he still pumps his fist to the beat. Mr. Reed takes care of the showboating, trucking and duckwalking with instruments as hefty as a bass saxophone.,Even in the 1970s, Mr. Segerâ€™s songs were about how fogies could continue to feel like rockers. â€œNight Moves,â€ù â€œMainstreetâ€ù and â€œAgainst the Windâ€ù are about memories of being young. â€œOld Time Rock & Rollâ€ù and â€œRock and Roll Never Forgetsâ€ù are about being untrendy and proud of it. For Mr. Seger, oldies date to rock's early years; he played a Chuck Berry song, ""You Never Can Tell,"" and emulated him in songs like""Katmandu."",In the 21st century Mr. Segerâ€™s kind of rock is more often heard on country stations than amid the punk-pop and post-grunge that are now classified as rock. â€œWait for Me,â€ù a ballad about restlessness and loyalty, has made the country charts. Yet while most of his new album was recorded in Nashville, Mr. Seger hasnâ€™t gone country so much as country has pumped itself up.,Mr. Segerâ€™s new songs are grounded in riffs that echo the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and the Who, and they have a growing streak of middle-aged disillusionment. â€œNo Matter Who You Are,â€ù with piano chords out of the Whoâ€™s â€œBaba Oâ€™Riley,â€ù observes, â€œThis is an ancient test, this is a shiny lie/Discover somethinâ€™ pure then sit and watch it die.â€ù,The album also has some political songs â€” the anti-Iraq-war song â€œNo Moreâ€ù and the environmentalist â€œBetweenâ€ù â€” but Mr. Seger left them out of the live set. The concert was an affirmation of tenacity, of coming to terms with time; not defying it, like a Rolling Stones concert, but living with its consequences. One of the ballads Mr. Seger sang was â€œBeautiful Loserâ€ù: â€œHe wants to dream like a young man, with the wisdom of an old man.â€ù It was a song he released back in 1975.",JON PARELES,"JAN. 27, 2007",A Rocker Whoâ€™s Come to Terms With Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/music/27sege.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Long viewed as the domain of grandmothers, needlework has undergone an image makeover in the last decade. Snowboarders, the old torchbearers of alt.culture, have embraced crocheting, making beanies to wear on the slopes; coffeehouses and subways are filled with fashion-conscious types busily knitting or doing needlepoint. And contemporary artists like Andrea Zittel, Lisa Anne Auerbach, Orly Genger and Jim Drain and the Forcefield collective have given crafts a coolly conceptual edge.,Time then for an exhibition celebrating the unfrumpiness of craft, and, sigh, what better institution than one that recently went through its own makeover, changing its name from the American Craft Museum to the sexier Museum of Arts & Design?,The sorry news is that, despite its title, â€œRadical Lace & Subversive Knitting,â€ù with around 40 works by 27 artists, is not a benchmark for introducing such craftsâ€™ coolness or radicalism to a vast art audience. Rather than exploring transgressive takes on knitting, the exhibition, organized by David Revere McFadden, the museumâ€™s chief curator, devotes most of its space to art that mimics the look or logic of knitting and lace and translates it into different materials.,In an essay in the showâ€™s catalog, Mr. McFadden does invoke interactive performances held in abandoned warehouses and the London Underground and people who knit sweaters for â€œoil-spill-damaged penguins to wear in Antarcticaâ€ù â€” the kind of activities you might associate with radical or subversive practice.,But in choosing the work for the show, he cites somewhat dated textile and crafts-based artists like Sophie Taeuber, Sonia Delaunay, Judy Chicago and Magdalena Abakanowicz as his models.,Much of the art on view is in the large-scale, virtuosic craft vein. Henk Wolversâ€™s flat sculptures created with porcelain slip, a form of liquid clay, borrow the tracery if not the actual patterns of lace. Piper Shepardâ€™s â€œLace Meanderâ€ù is a series of hanging muslin scrolls into which the artist cut lace patterns with an X-Acto knife. Bennett Battaileâ€™s delicate sculpture of thin glass rods and Barbara Zuckerâ€™s rubber sculptures both invoke lace-tracery in heavier materials.,Some of the artists address â€œissues of politics, gender and ethics,â€ù as a wall text puts it, in a general way. Janet Echelmanâ€™s giant, hand-knotted nylon net hanging from the ceiling in the museumâ€™s entryway recreates the look of a nuclear mushroom cloud. Freddie Robinsâ€™s sinister-looking gray-knit bodysuit, with the words â€œCraft Killsâ€ù emblazoned across the chest, alludes to the airline ban on knitting needles in the post-9/11 era.,The works most in keeping with the showâ€™s politically charged title are more interactive and collective, or more related to performance. For example, Cat Mazzaâ€™s collectively crocheted â€œNike Blanket Petition,â€ù a campaign against sweatshop practices represented here in a series of photographs, will be sent to Nikeâ€™s corporate headquarters.,A video of Dave Coleâ€™s â€œKnitting Machineâ€ù project shows two John Deere excavators wielding telephone poles tapered to look like knitting needles â€” and missiles â€” to knit a giant American flag in the courtyard of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Mass.,Sabrina Gschwandtner, an artist and founder of KnitKnit magazine, has set up a â€œWartime Knitting Circleâ€ù surrounded by panels made of industrially knitted photos of Vietnam War protesters knitting, British women knitting woolen covers for World War II hand grenades, soldiers knitting during World War I.,She invites people to join her in knitting â€œblankets for recoveryâ€ù for people in Afghanistan and troops convalescing in military hospitals, among other projects. (On the exhibitionâ€™s opening day, Ms. Gschwandtner was chatting and knitting with Phyllis Rodriguez, whose son died in the north tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11 and who has since befriended AÃ¯cha el-Wafi, mother of Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent serving a life sentence  after his conspiracy conviction in the 9/11 attacks.,Needlework indeed has a radical past. William Morris, a mainstay of the Royal School of Needlework and the Arts and Crafts movement in England, protested late-19th-century industrial production. Feminist art in the 1970s drew heavily on so-called womenâ€™s work, and Rosemarie Trockelâ€™s â€œknitting picturesâ€ù of the 1980s cleverly drew on political themes.,So many more artists might have been included whose work explores the social aspects of knitting and lace or who more radically recast these forms: Simon Perotin, of the punk-doily creations; the artisans in the Church of Craft; Ms. Zittel; Ms. Auerbach;, Mr. Drain; and so on.,Given the showâ€™s title, some visitors will arrive wanting to know how needlework, which runs counter to our technology-  and information-saturated age, has become such a cultural juggernaut, and how it might serve to break down the barriers between artist and amateur, art and craft. A few works here may well satisfy that desire. Most will not.,â€œRadical Lace & Subversive Knittingâ€ù runs through June 17 at the Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. on Thursdays); closed on holidays.

"A silhouette of old lace blows across a screen above the stage, tangling with  the shadows of the performers singing below. Then the shadows free themselves of the singers and begin to dance, as if giving life to the dreams in the music.,Visuals were an important part of the Austrian Cultural Forumâ€™s two-week â€œMostly Operettaâ€ù festival, which ended on Thursday with a program that fell into the â€œmostlyâ€ù category: the American songs of Kurt Weill. Enhancing each of the festivalâ€™s five recital programs was a subtle screen-play of shadow and light by the installation artist Victoria Coeln. The shadows mingled with photographs and videos taken in Ms. Coelnâ€™s studio to create moving shadow images like pressed flowers with wisps of color at their edges. Smoky and ephemeral and restrained so that they enhanced but never intruded on the performances, they were a thoughtful visualization of nostalgia.,The festival focused on the â€œsilver ageâ€ù of operetta in 20th-century Vienna (following the 19th-century â€œgolden ageâ€ù of Strauss and Offenbach). Operetta is tricky: potentially as sparkling and sophisticated as Champagne, it is often produced today as a kind of Kool-Aid punch, overbright and oversweet and with very little appeal to a discriminating audience.,Ms. Coelnâ€™s visuals were a wonderful antidote. The difficulty  â€” to judge from Jan. 18â€™s program, focusing on composers forced to emigrate by the Nazis, and Thursdayâ€™s Weill evening  â€” appeared to lie in freeing the performers from stock clichÃ©s to attain the same kind of sophistication.,The concept of presenting operetta excerpts like lieder, in an intimate setting with piano accompaniment, was partly dictated by the limitations of the forumâ€™s tiny concert hall. It ran a bit aground on the realities of a form that emulates the climactic bigness of opera. In the program of â€œexiledâ€ù composers, Elisabeth Flechl and Johannes FÃ¶ttinger belied the notion that native specialists bring more insight or liedlike subtlety to operetta by simply pumping out one number after another until their voices were spent.,Ms. Flechl was the more vocally limber, but sang even â€œMeine Lippen, sie kÃ_ssen so heissâ€ù (â€œMy lips give hot kisses,â€ù the signature aria from Franz Leharâ€™s â€œGiudittaâ€ù) with generic earnestness, failing to convey an ounce of seductive sexuality.,More successful was Ute Gfrerer, the soloist in the Weill program (also accompanied by Markus Vorzellner, a staunch pianist), who arranged the songs into a kind of dramatic monologue, was more attuned to the nuances of her texts and tempered her singing with a cabaret sensibility, digging into her chest voice when appropriate. She was helped by some pretty great songs like â€œLost in the Stars.â€ù The evening made a strong case for both Weill and his lyricists.,But all this did, alas, was reinforce the idea that operettaâ€™s main value in this country was as a precursor of the classic Broadway musical. To truly reanimate the genre on a level consistent with Ms. Coelnâ€™s visuals, it would take a singer like the 94-year-old Marta Eggerth, who in the course of a discussion/performance on Jan. 11 sang a piece by Lehar, her old friend, â€œWarum hast du mich wachgekÃ_sst?â€ù from â€œFriederike.â€ù She showed how a pro can breathe life into an operetta excerpt  â€” and also that the form is a dying art unless other singers can learn from her and save it.",ANNE MIDGETTE,"JAN. 27, 2007",Operetta and Weill in Front; Moving Shadows in Back,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/27weil.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As any nature show will demonstrate, mammals use several methods for marking their territory.,The species commonly known as artist has untold ways, however; one might, for example, perch on the lap of every audience member, as Trajal Harrell did to start his â€œShowponyâ€ù on Thursday night at ,. Straddling crossed legs, he seemed at once defiant and helpless, simultaneously driven by and luxuriating in the ritualistic task.,This duality textured the length of the 70-minute performance, which took the shape of a fashion show. Two rows, each with 43 chairs, flanked a corridor of vinyl flooring, giving everyone a front-row seat to watch Mr. Harrell, Katy Hernan and Christina Vassiliou strut their stuff.,Both women are strong performers, and Ms. Vassiliou possesses a perfectly stony, of-course-Iâ€™m-sexy modelâ€™s mien. (You sensed that the expression never changed even when she donned a ridiculously grotesque clownâ€™s mask). But Mr. Harrell owned the runway, from his rigidly thrown-out hips to his wonderfully expressive fingertips.,At the same time, he fractured the audienceâ€™s attention. As the dancers, matching Mr. Harrellâ€™s restless soundtrack, changed clothes frequently and rapidly, they moved from jagged, hyper interpretations of runway behavior to robotic movement phrases reminiscent of early postmodern dance in their mundane repetition, but undertaken with a desperate urgency.,At one point Ms. Hernan was transported by what you assume  was a simulated orgasm, head thrown back and body writhing in one of three empty seats in the audience that the performers employed; the middle-aged woman next to her crossed her arms and legs defensively, and the athletic man on her other side smiled and looked away. Both concentrated on the other dancers; nobody else could look away from Ms. Hernan.,Such extravagance of desire elevated material that was also unapologetically camp and sentimental and silly. His territory claimed, Mr. Harrell made it completely his own, even including a lengthy photographic slide show of his choreographer peers. Edited by David BergÃ©, the pictures slid by one after the next, as mesmerizing as they were banal.,Audience members and performers sat together in the darkness of St. Markâ€™s Church, properly reverent in what is, after all, a place of worship.",CLAUDIA LA ROCCO,"JAN. 27, 2007",Fashion Rituals and Runway,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/dance/27harr.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€™s streamlined readings of the Russian and German repertory are an acquired taste (though one worth acquiring), and his relatively rare forays into American repertory have been well meaning, if unpersuasive. But there is no one to touch him in Italian music, and that was what he brought to the , on Thursday evening, the start of his second week of subscription programs with the orchestra at Avery Fisher Hall.,Mr. Mutiâ€™s message was that there is more to Italian Romanticism than opera â€” although he touched on opera as well â€” and to that end he devoted the first half of his program to Giuseppe Martucciâ€™s enormous Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat minor (Op. 66), with Gerhard Oppitz as the soloist. Martucci has been scarce in New York: the Philharmonic last performed this concerto in 1911. But Mr. Muti recorded it (along with Martucciâ€™s evocative â€œCanzone dei Ricordiâ€ù) for Sony Classical in 1995, and he has kept it in his repertory, perhaps betting that accidental encounters will win this composer a new audience.,He is on to something. This is a virtuoso concerto (Martucci was, not surprisingly, a pianist), so solidly packed with explosive, daredevil keyboard writing that it isnâ€™t until well into the 20-minute first movement that the orchestra has much of substance to offer. When the orchestra does take its stand, its contributions are currents of lyricism or subtle but ear-catching shifts in color, to contrast with the showiness of the piano writing.,Still, itâ€™s the piano that rivets the ear, and if you look past the layer of surface bluster youâ€™ll find magnificently detailed and at times almost Brahmsian keyboard writing.,Mr. Oppitz was an ideal soloist. He attacked the work with all the vigor it demanded, and played with muscularity, clarity and, in the central Larghetto, a poetic touch. He and Mr. Muti made a powerful case: this concerto may not be the Beethoven â€œEmperor,â€ù but it makes a welcome change from, say, the Tchaikovsky First.,After the intermission, Mr. Muti led a taut account of the ballet music from Verdiâ€™s â€œMacbeth,â€ù a fine warm-up for the real business of the second half, Respighiâ€™s â€œFeste Romane.â€ù Pictorialism runs deep in Italian music as far back as Monteverdi, and Respighi reveled in it. Here the orchestra evokes everything from the roaring lions at the ancient Circus Maximus, to parades of chanting penitents, to sloppy inebriates, all vividly.,Mr. Muti had the Philharmonic playing at full throttle, with no loss of either tone or precision. This orchestraâ€™s brasses, which got a thorough workout, have rarely sounded better.",ALLAN KOZINN,"JAN. 27, 2007",Italian Romanticism From a Rarely Heard Source,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/music/27phil.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If Rossini had been in the audience on Thursday night at the Harry de Jur Playhouse, he would surely have found the stylish and witty new production of â€œIl Signor Bruschinoâ€ù by the Gotham Chamber Opera as cheekily funny as everyone else did.,The revival was overdue. â€œIl Signor Bruschino,â€ù the last of five one-act farces Rossini wrote for the Teatro San MoisÃ¨ in Venice between 1810 and 1813, was last staged in New York in 1933, according to the Gotham company.,In this frothy, youthful comedy, Rossini experiments with the comic gift for mistaken identities evident in his later opera â€œIl Barbiere di Siviglia.â€ù The Venetian poet Giuseppe Maria Foppa wrote the libretto for â€œBruschino,â€ù based on â€œLe Fils par Hazard,â€ù a French farce. Two young lovers, Florville and Sofia, want to marry. But Florville is the son of an enemy of Gaudenzio, Sofiaâ€™s guardian, who in any event has already promised her to the eminent Bruschino family. Florville waylays and impersonates the legitimate groom, then convinces Gaudenzio that he is Bruschinoâ€™s son.,Thanks to Robin Guarinoâ€™s clever directing, an opera that could be mere bumbling slapstick is sharp, with snappy comic timing. Donald Eastmanâ€™s set updates the action to the Via Veneto in Rome in about 1960. The costume designer Martin Pakledinaz presents Florville, sung by Alek Shrader, as a sort of ,, and Sofia, sung by Lisa Hopkins, as a demurely dressed ,.,There were other Felliniesque touches, like a Vespa, a bicycle, a priest and a scampering little boy who knocks on a door to mirror the moment in the overture when the violinists tap their music stands with their bows.,â€œIl Signor Bruschinoâ€ù has plenty of tongue-twisting recitative and vocal acrobatics, but none of the strong cast seemed trapped in a coloratura torture chamber. At times they even made a merry farce of Rossiniâ€™s bel canto obstacle course.,There was fiery chemistry between Ms. Hopkins and Mr. Shrader, both promising performers, who sang with good phrasing and control. Eric Jordan gave a fine, confident performance as the jovial,  fabulously named Gaudenzio Strappapuppole, who almost seems a personification of Rossini, a cheery, witty gourmand.,Signor Bruschino was updated from a generic buffo character to an oily, scholarly-looking, suit-clad neurotic, excellently acted and sung by Marco Nistico.,As the maid Marianna, Emily Langford Johnson was a sexy, Sophia Loren-like flirt, while Filiberto, the burly barman, was sung with aplomb by Matthew Lau.  Steven Goldstein, as the police commissioner and priest, was also strong.,Neal Goren, Gothamâ€™s artistic director, conducted a lively, tight performance of the chirpy score.

"Not everyone wants to perform pure traditional gypsy flamenco. A grass-roots genre of flamenco Latino has sprung up in New York in recent years. The program presented by Andrea Del Conte Danza EspaÃ±a on Thursday night at the Joyce SoHo fits somewhere between those styles, but never created the crucial flamenco feeling of an internal fire reaching up into the soul from the core of the earth.,Ms. Del Conte, an American who trained in ballet before taking on Spanish dancing, was closer to the traditional in her Seguiriyas and Farruca, but without that fire. A sweet-faced, elegant woman, she might have been the youngish director of a school for young  dancers. Barbara Martinez, who sang and danced, made something fresh of the Latino style in several numbers. But Marco de Ana was unprepossessing, a major problem for a male flamenco artist, in a company of dancers completed by Mieko Sato and Sol Koeraus.,The musicians were more fun, in an ensemble that included Alfonso Cid, Arturo Martinez, Cristian Puig and Sean Kupisz.

"Four men, their backs to the audience, stand in a line upstage at the beginning of George Balanchineâ€™s â€œAgon.â€ù Then they turn, and Stravinskyâ€™s bright fanfare of trumpets heralds the start of the ballet that, in Balanchineâ€™s words, used history as â€œthe takeoff point.â€ù,Stravinsky used a French Baroque dance manual as the basis for his score; Balanchine deployed the academic vocabulary of classical ballet. And yet dance history was changed by â€œAgon,â€ù with its angular, tensile movements that perfectly matched the composerâ€™s astringent forays into 12-tone technique.,Audiences must have been hardly able to register visually the compressed, unconventional movement when the ballet had its premiere in 1957; even today the choreography, with its unexpected transitions and acrobatic tension, can surprise, and in the best performances always does.,One of those performances came from an almost all-new cast at the New York City Ballet on Thursday night, when â€œAgonâ€ù was danced with a uniformly spiky intensity and a sensitivity to the rhythmic interplay between the music and the movement. Andrew Veyette gave a lovely sinuousness to his â€œSarabandeâ€ù solo, and Ellen Bar was coolly seductive in her â€œBransle Gayâ€ù solo and the subsequent pas de trois, balancing unworriedly in arabesque as her two partners switched sides.,But it was Maria Kowroski, more familiar with her part, who electrified the whole work in the pas de deux that is at its heart. With her long, hyper-flexible limbs, Ms. Kowroski can sometimes look unanchored in space, but here every movement was diamond sharp and dazzling. SÃ©bastien Marcovici, making his debut, partnered with subtlety and skill.,Another explosive performance came at the end of the evening, from Sterling Hyltin, new to her role in â€œSymphony in Three Movements,â€ù and just as riveting. Ms. Hyltin came flying onto the stage with huge, traveling jumps â€” Balanchineâ€™s jazzy knees-together surprise opener to another major Stravinsky score â€” and she often looked as if she might rocket offstage. In a good way.,Amar Ramasar, new to the cryptic yet poignant central pas de deux, worked well with Jennie Somogyi â€” curiously sluggish in her solo sections â€” and nicely conveyed the wit and humor within the balletâ€™s jagged, lighting-bolt aesthetic.,Also on the all-Stravinsky-Balanchine program was â€œMonumentum Pro Gesualdoâ€ù and â€œMovements for Piano and Orchestra,â€ù both authoritatively headed by Charles Askegard and Rebecca Krohn; and â€œDuo Concertant,â€ù in which Nikolaj Hubbe,  partnering Yvonne Borree, was a spirited delight.,The orchestra, conducted by FayÃ§al Karoui,  occasionally sounded patchy, but gave â€œSymphony in Three Movementsâ€ù a fine, propulsive performance.",ROSLYN SULCAS,"JAN. 27, 2007",Finding a Famous Pairâ€™s Intensity and Sensitivity,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/arts/27agon.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26 â€” Use of Genentechâ€™s new eye drug, Lucentis, might raise the ,, the company said Friday.,The company posted on its Web site a letter it  sent to retina specialists this week. According to the letter, 1.2 percent of patients treated with a high dose of Lucentis in a clinical trial suffered a stroke, compared with only 0.3 percent of those treated with a low dose. The difference was statistically significant.,The new findings could conceivably damp some demand for Lucentis, because the high dose, 0.5 milligrams per injection, is the one that is marketed. Shares of Genentech  fell 89 cents, or 1 percent, to $86.57.,Dawn Kalmar, a spokeswoman for Genentech, said Friday that the company wanted to move quickly to communicate the information. But she  said the company did not expect  the new data to prompt a change in the drugâ€™s label, which already contains a warning about risks of blood-clotting events like strokes.,Lucentis, also called ranibizumab,  is approved to treat age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. It is the first drug shown in clinical trials to improve eyesight for a significant number of patients, as opposed to merely slowing the rate of vision loss.,Approved in June, the drug had sales of $380 million for the rest of 2006, an amount that greatly exceeded some analystsâ€™ expectations.  Genentech executives have cautioned, though, that sales growth may moderate as patients on the drug are treated less frequently.,The new data was preliminary, from 2,400 patients who had been followed for an average of 230 days since beginning treatment. The full study will continue and will follow them   for a year.,Dr. Philip J. Rosenfeld, a retina specialist, said the preliminary data would not influence him because it could later change.,â€œRight now, it will have no impact on my use of Lucentis,â€ù Dr. Rosenfeld, who is at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute of the University of Miami, said in an e-mail message. â€œWhen given a choice between a high likelihood of blindness or a 1 percent risk of stroke, I think most patients will choose their vision.â€ù,The label for Lucentis notes a theoretical risk of blood-clotting events like strokes and heart attacks, though it says the rate seen in studies was â€œlow,â€ù at less than 4 percent.,In the new study, the rate of heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular incidents did not differ significantly between the  dosages, the company said.,The new findings could also raise questions about the risks of Avastin, a , drug sold by Genentech. It is  being used off-label to treat macular degeneration because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, which costs about $2,000 per monthly injection. Both drugs work by a similar mechanism, although Lucentis was specifically designed to be injected into the eye.,Doctors who use Avastin say they have experienced few if any safety problems. But Avastin has not been tested in extensive controlled clinical trials as Lucentis has.",ANDREW POLLACK,"JAN. 27, 2007","Eye Drug Might Raise Risk of Stroke, Genentech Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/business/27drug.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€™s chauffeur was so stressed by his job that eight of his teeth fell out because he was grinding them at night, according to court papers filed by his lawyer.,The chauffeur, Koral Karsan, 50, complained about his teeth in a taped conversation with Ms. Onoâ€™s lawyer, Jonas Herbsman, which the prosecution turned over to Mr. Karsanâ€™s lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, in advance of a bail hearing yesterday.,Mr. Karsan has been charged with trying to extort $2 million from Ms. Ono, and prosecutors said he threatened to kill her if she did not comply.,But in  court papers, submitted as part of a bail application for Mr. Karsan, Mr. Gottlieb said the accusation that Mr. Karsan had people waiting to kill Ms. Ono was â€œjust plain false.â€ù,On the recording, Mr. Gottlieb said that Mr. Karsan can be heard saying that there are â€œa lot of people out there who want to getâ€ù Ms. Ono.,The chauffeur then went on to describe those people as â€œmy psychiatrist, my dentist, my lawyer,â€ù Mr. Gottlieb said. Mr. Karsan added, according to his lawyer, that â€œtheyâ€™re all Beatles fans and they hate her. So they all want to use me.â€ù,Commenting on this part of the tape, Mr. Gottlieb said in his papers, â€œWe respectfully submit that this should come as no shock to anyone who is at all familiar with Yoko Ono and the Beatles.â€ù,Mr. Gottlieb added that the tape showed that the demand for money was not extortion, but a demand for compensation for pain and suffering.,Prosecutors have described this tape as one of their most important pieces of evidence â€” along with a letter from Mr. Karsan to Ms. Ono â€” in the extortion case against Mr. Karsan.,But Mr. Gottlieb said that the only reference to killing came when Ms. Onoâ€™s lawyer asked for the name of Mr. Karsanâ€™s lawyer, and Mr. Karsan refused, saying that his legal team was â€œready to kill Yoko.â€ù,To which Ms. Onoâ€™s lawyer asked if he was speaking metaphorically. Mr. Karsan, a Turkish immigrant, replied, â€œNo, no, no, no metaphorically, Iâ€™m telling it literally.â€ù By this, Mr. Gottlieb said, Mr. Karsan clearly meant that his lawyers â€œwould literally kill her in court.â€ù,Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, declined comment last night on Mr. Gottliebâ€™s account of the tape.,Mr. Gottlieb quoted from the tape in a letter to Justice Daniel P. FitzGerald of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, in an effort to have his client released on bail.,In a brief hearing yesterday, Justice FitzGerald declined to set bail because of the risk that Mr. Karsan would flee to Turkey. He said that after listening to the tape, he saw â€œno substantial change in the material facts,â€ù that is, the demand for $2 million and the threat to release confidential information about Ms. Ono.,But he agreed to Mr. Gottliebâ€™s request for a speedy trial, setting a tentative trial date of Feb. 12.",ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS,"JAN. 27, 2007",Onoâ€™s Driver Complained About Stress on Recording,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/nyregion/27yoko.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Herding freelancers is a bit like herding cats. Both are notoriously independent.,Nonetheless, Sara Horowitz has figured out a way to bring together tens of thousands of freelancers â€” Web designers, video editors, writers, dancers and graphic artists â€” into a thriving organization.,Ms. Horowitz has founded the Freelancers Union, offering members lower-cost health coverage and other benefits that many freelancers often have a hard time getting.,A former labor lawyer, Ms. Horowitz intends to form a forceful advocacy group for freelancers and independent contractors,  the most mobile members of an increasingly mobile work force. In addition, she is trying to adapt unions to a world far different from yesteryear, when workers often remained with one employer for two or three decades.,â€œThis really is about a new unionism,â€ù she said, â€œand what it means is to bring people together to solve their problems.â€ù,Having signed up 40,000 freelancers from the New York area, she is now planting her groupâ€™s flag across the nation, hoping to herd far more of the nationâ€™s 20 million freelancers and independent contractors into her union.,â€œThese workers are the backbone for so many industries vital to our nationâ€™s economy â€” I.T., financial services, the arts, advertising and publishing,â€ù she said. â€œYet these same workers are not afforded simple job protections or a social safety net.â€ù,By creating a new type of union for nontraditional workers, Ms. Horowitz hopes to help revive the labor movement. Its membership has slipped to just 7.4 percent of the private-sector work force, down from one-third in 1960.,Unlike traditional unions, the Freelancers Union has no intention of bargaining with employers. Still, Ms. Horowitz says her groupâ€™s main goal is identical to that of all unions â€” providing mutual aid, in this case health benefits, to their members.,â€œMore and more people are not going to get their benefits from an employer,â€ù Ms. Horowitz said. â€œOur ultimate goal is to update the New Deal. It is to create a new safety net thatâ€™s connected to the individual as they move from job to job.â€ù,Jennifer Lebin joined the Freelancers Union while living in Manhattan after seeing one of its subway ads that say, â€œWelcome to Middle-Class Poverty.â€ù Ms. Lebin, a political consultant, bought the groupâ€™s health coverage and paid $20 to attend a union-sponsored seminar offering tax advice to consultants and independent contractors.,Ms. Lebin, who has moved to Chicago, expressed disappointment that she could no longer use the unionâ€™s health plan â€” doctors in Illinois are not part of the network. â€œIf there is a way that the Freelancers Union could offer the same benefits to members outside the New York area, Iâ€™d sign up in a heartbeat,â€ù she said.,The Freelancers Union, which sells benefits Ã  la carte, hopes to offer health benefits in 10 states by the end of this year. It is already offering its discounted disability and life insurance nationwide.,More than 14,000 freelancers in the New York area have bought  its health insurance, generally for about $300 a month, some 40 percent below what they would normally pay elsewhere. The organization has also used its group purchasing power to help freelancers obtain discounted dental, disability and life insurance.,Membership in the Freelancers Union is free. To finance itself, the group uses an entrepreneurial model:  it earns modest commissions on the benefits that its members buy.,Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois at Chicago, praised the groupâ€™s innovative approach, although he said it could not replace traditional unions.,â€œThis needs to be part of laborâ€™s repertoire,â€ù Professor Bruno  said. â€œTo the degree it helps to reshape what weâ€™ve come to understand what a labor organization is, itâ€™s all to the good.â€ù,Ms. Horowitz, 44, won a MacArthur genius award in 1999 after she established Working Today, a  group based in Brooklyn that focused on providing benefits to New Yorkers in flexible work arrangements. She founded the Freelancers Union in 2003, with a more ambitious vision.,The group intends to do advocacy work just like a labor union. In New York, it is backing legislation to let freelancers obtain unemployment insurance. Even if freelancers are laid off after working for an employer for two years, they cannot receive unemployment benefits because they are considered independent contractors.,Some members do not expect the group to play the role of a traditional union.,â€œUnions represent members in negotiating wages and benefits,â€ù said Barbara Scott, an artist in Berlin Center, Ohio. â€œI donâ€™t see the Freelancers Union functioning that way. I see it as a networking tool.â€ù,Bobby Ambrose, a graphic designer in Chicago, disagreed.,â€œI was hoping that they would be like a labor union,â€ù Mr. Ambrose said. â€œThere are a lot of situations that freelancers face regarding pay rates and job hours, like when youâ€™re doing full-time work when youâ€™re only hired to be part time. It would be nice if they could push to make things better.â€ù,Several traditional unions are studying the freelance unionâ€™s progress, perhaps to borrow some  ideas on organizing nonunion workers and offering benefits.,â€œThe labor movement,â€ù Ms. Horowitz said, â€œwent from guilds through mutual aid societies through craft unions and through industrial unionism. Youâ€™re not going to persuade me that there is not going to be a new form of unionism. The storyâ€™s not over on what weâ€™re creating.â€ù",STEVEN GREENHOUSE,"JAN. 27, 2007","Labor Union, Redefined, for Freelance Workers",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/us/27freelance.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calypso, a lilting style of Afro-Caribbean music, developed as a means of communication between African slaves. Soca is a modern form of calypso with an up-tempo beat.

"TRENTON, Jan. 26 â€” Five people have been arrested on charges that they ran a drug ring that had sold more than  $20 million worth of painkillers, or one million pills, law enforcement officials in New Jersey announced on Friday.,Attorney General Stuart Rabner, flanked by state police and federal Drug Enforcement Agency officials, said at a news conference that the scheme had been operating for more than a year, and that it had sold 20,000 to 30,000 OxyContin and Percocet pills per week, mostly through  distributors based in the Bronx. Mr. Rabner also said  the drugs found their way to people seeking a heroin substitute in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts.,OxyContin, a narcotic pain reliever similar to morphine, has become a popular street drug in recent years. In perhaps the most celebrated case, Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk-radio host, settled a prescription drug fraud charge  against him last spring after  an inquiry into whether he illegally obtained OxyContin from more than one doctor.,In the New Jersey case, the authorities said that Mohmed Hassanain, 41, ran the operation out of his business, Lyons Avenue Auto Sales in Newark.,But the operation had a suburban sheen to it as well, according to officials. Mr. Hassanain ran some of the business out of his house in West Orange, just a couple of blocks from the Essex County Country Club.,He employed a doctor from Livingston, Mario Comesanas, 51, who wrote 300 fraudulent prescriptions a week in exchange for $30,000 cash each week,  the authorities said. They contend that Mr. Hassanainâ€™s cousin, Ahmed Felix Aly, a pharmacist who lives in Union Township, would then fill the  prescriptions at his business, RGN Pharmacy, in Newark.,Mr. Rabner and Gerard P. McAleer, special agent in charge of the D.E.A.â€™s New Jersey division, described the operation as significant when compared with other pharmaceutical rings in the state.,New Jersey officials acknowledged that a statewide tracking system meant to monitor possible abuses did not provide investigators with the initial lead; rather, a member of the general public did. Asked whether that system needed to be improved, Mr. Rabner said, â€œAs with all investigations, we learn a great deal about how people operateâ€ù and added that state officials planned to â€œfollow up on those lessons.â€ù,The five people accused of being members of the drug ring were arrested late Thursday in a sweep of 10 places in New Jersey. The authorities  found several guns, including a .357 Magnum, and at Dr. Comesanasâ€™s home was several hundred thousand dollars in cash, they said. Mr. Hassanain, meanwhile, had $10,000 in his sleeve when he was arrested, they said.,Mr. Hassanain and Mr. Comesanas pleaded not guilty to the charges Friday afternoon in Essex County Superior Court in Newark. Mr. Hassanain was being held in $1.5 million bail and Mr. Comesanas in $1 million.  Judge Michael J.

"Finding the perfect island to satisfy everyone on a family vacation can be quite a challenge. The kids are tired of the beach by noon and need something else to do. Dad wants to golf all morning and lie on the beach all afternoon. And Mom just wants to retreat to the spa. Plus, any place that requires changing planes is too much of a hassle, and if you or your spouse want any chance of watching the sunset in peace, a resort without a babysitting program is out of the question.,Consider Aruba, 15 miles off the coast of Venezuela. It takes less than five hours to fly there nonstop from New York. Many major airlines offer direct flights from the United States, with some advance fares running as low as $129 each way not including taxes or fees. Regular rates are in the $400 range.,Families will find a wide variety of kid-friendly accommodations with activities ranging from windsurfing to snorkeling to scavenger hunts. There is no shortage of chain hotels, ranging from the Holiday Inn to the Hyatt Regency, each offering its own kids program. And, yes, many of them also have elaborate spas.,Beyond the resorts, the island has dozens of quirky attractions that appeal to a kid's curiosity, including a butterfly farm, a donkey sanctuary and â€œSnubaâ€ù tours, which involve a breathing apparatus that allows kids as young as 8 to descend to a depth of 20 feet with the aid of an instructor. And for grown-ups, there are dozens of casinos and nightclubs.,Still not convinced?

"AT a tasting in 1984 at the International Wine Center, a wine school in Manhattan, Peter M. F.  Sichel, a seasonal South Fork resident, pointed to a bottle labeled Vin de lâ€™Ile Blanc and said, â€œTry that.â€ù Mr. Sichel,  then a major figure in Germanyâ€™s wine industry (he has since retired),  has a masterly understanding of whites. I tried it, and was charmed.,A semidry riesling, it resembled a Mosel wine. Vin de lâ€™Ile Blanc, whose name  translates as White Wine of the Island, was made by Ray Blum, a grape-grower who lived in Peconic and had founded Peconic Bay Vineyards in Cutchogue in 1980. It was that bottle that sparked my interest in the local industry .,Mr. Blum, a genial, seemingly ever-smiling man, died of cancer  on Jan. 10 at the age of 62.  The owner of Ackerly Pond Vineyards in Peconic, he sold grapes and wine under that label and planted and maintained othersâ€™ vineyards.,Vin de lâ€™Ile Blanc symbolizes the debt that early colleagues and their successors owe to Ray Blumâ€™s risk-taking.,At the outset, conventional wisdom doubted the prospects for riesling on the East End. It was as if nature and man told Mr. Blum,  â€œYou canâ€™t,â€ù and he replied, â€œOh, yeah?â€ù   He prevailed, attracting  customers to  his homey tasting room on Main Road with his Vin de lâ€™Ile Blanc and other wines.  Today, respectable rieslings remain minor gems at some North Fork wineries.,Mr. Blum sold his property in 1999   to  Ursula and Paul Lowerre, who  renamed it Peconic Bay Winery.   The winemaker, Greg Gove,  said, â€œWe were going to do away with Vin de lâ€™Ile Blanc, but we discovered there was a following for it, so we kept it.â€ù  He went on producing the wine, but recently the owners decided to replace it with another wine in a different style, he said.  After the last 28 cases are sold, it will be history.,The nonvintage Vin de lâ€™Ile Blanc, now a $12 riesling-chardonnay blend, is described by the winery as having  â€œluxuriant notes of pineapple, honeysuckle, fresh apple and pear.â€ù,Mr.  Blum bequeathed Long Islanders a sweet memory.",HOWARD G.

"ALBANY, Jan. 26â€” Gov. , said on Friday that he would seek billions of dollars in Medicaid and health care cost savings when he unveils his first executive budget on Wednesday.,But while he repeatedly used the word â€œreformâ€ù in a speech here, hospital groups heard the word â€œcut.â€ù That dissonance will probably set the stage for what could be a fierce battle in the Legislature over the governorâ€™s plan.,â€œFor too long, we have financed the health care system we have, not the health care system we need, so weâ€™re left pumping billions of dollars into a broken system,â€ù Mr. Spitzer said. â€œWhat went wrong is that health care decision making became co-opted by every interest other than the patientâ€™s interest.â€ù,Among the governorâ€™s proposals were eliminating the annual inflation adjustments on Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes and substantially changing the way the state subsidizes health care providers and graduate medical programs.,â€œNew York spends more on hospitals and nursing-home care than any state in the nation,â€ù he said. â€œThis spending is unsustainable and unwise.â€ù,He said his administration would seek to save $200 million annually by taking steps to reduce Medicaid prescription drug costs and overhaul the Department of Health. He said he would also follow up on his campaign pledge to provide coverage for the stateâ€™s 400,000 uninsured children.,The proposals sent shudders through some corners of the health care world.,â€œThese are many of the same budget cuts that Governor Pataki proposed, and they were rejected because, frankly, they arenâ€™t reforms,â€ù said Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State.,â€œBy his tone today, he intends to make it a serious fight,â€ù he said. â€œThe Legislature knows that these cuts, now two decades old, do not constitute reform. Iâ€™m working on the assumption we can persuade them to reject them.â€ù,But many were pleased by what they heard, from fiscal conservatives who have called for an end to Albanyâ€™s spending growth to  health care advocacy groups.,â€œWe think he is taking a very bold step and putting New York in the lead in the nation in terms of providing health care coverage for children,â€ù said Donna Lawrence, executive director of the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund New York.,Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, an affiliate of the policy group the Manhattan Institute, said, â€œI think he set exactly the right tone. The patient-first premise is exactly where we need to be, and I think itâ€™s a very positive step.â€ù,Mr. Spitzer said the state was paying far more on graduate medical education than other states â€” $77,000 per  medical resident  compared with $21,000 in California.,â€œWe discovered that many of those dollars are going to pay for phantom residents and doctors who donâ€™t even exist,â€ù he said.,Mr. Sisto said he objected to what he called the â€œprosecutorial rhetoricâ€ù in the governorâ€™s speech and his description of past deals.,â€œWe should be having a policy debate about the future, not lamenting the past,â€ù he said.,Mr. Spitzer specifically criticized a 2002 deal involving Gov. George E. Pataki and 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East that was used in part to provide raises for health care workers. â€œAs a result of this deal, well over $3 billion alone was pumped into the health care delivery system with little or no accountability,â€ù he said. A spokeswoman for the union did not return calls seeking comment.,Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said, â€œCuts to me do not spell reform, particularly when the hospital sector is not at all driving the increases in Medicaid.â€ù,Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assemblyâ€™s Health Committee, said getting the proposals through the Legislature would â€œdepend on a lot of the details.â€ù,â€œSome of the Medicaid cuts will create problems, but I think the policy directions are terrific,â€ù he said. â€œThere is certainly an enormous amount here that I will fight very hard to enact.â€ù",DANNY HAKIM,"JAN. 27, 2007",Spitzer Sees Health Savings; Hospitals Call Them Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/nyregion/27health.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ITâ€™S like Restaurant Week all year long at Gabrielleâ€™s Brasserie in ,. This appealing spot,  formerly 22 North Park under the same owners, changed its name, its chef and its menu in late November.  It  now offers a three-course dinner for $25 that is sure to be a hit with patrons who love good food but donâ€™t want to break the bank every time they eat out. That price includes everything on the menu: no exceptions, no supplements. It is offered all night â€” not just during â€œearly birdâ€ù hours â€”   every night of the week. It was even in place on New Yearâ€™s Eve.,The $25 meal is a story;  the quality and quantity of the food here, which is intensely flavorful and stylishly presented,  make it a compelling one.  Jeffrey C. DeVille,    a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.,  is the executive chef.   He has  worked alongside Susan Spicer at Bayona in New Orleans and under Mario Batali at Lupa in Manhattan;  his last position was as sous chef at 105 Harbor in Cold Spring Harbor.,Tom Schaudel, Long Islandâ€™s peripatetic restaurateur, served as the consulting chef  and helped develop the new menu.,It is an exciting one, with a dozen appetizer picks, the same number of entree choices and about a half-dozen desserts. (There are also specials.) The appetizer Iâ€™d make a beeline for is pan-seared rock shrimp cakes with a perfect avocado-pineapple salsa. There was also a pleasing crabcake special atop a crunchy kimchi salad, but the shrimp cakes,  with their arresting, chunky texture,  put it in the shade.,Fork-tender ribs (four meaty ones), accompanied by a green papaya slaw and a log of cornbread, were a hearty and delicious opener.  So was  the gratin of Long Island oysters: four large ones in their shells combined with Boursin cheese and cubes of spicy andouille sausage. The grilled and roasted veggie plate sounded light but was actually large enough to pass as an entree. It included mounds of hummus, tapenade and roasted red peppers and arrived with grilled pita.,The adventurous were rewarded with a special of grilled smelts atop a mÃ©lange of roasted sweet potato cubes and what our waiter called fava beans.  They looked and tasted like   black beans; in any case,  they were seductively good.,Entrees were  equally appealing. The braised lamb shank was a fall-away-tender success atop roasted root vegetables and three-cheese polenta. Other winners were perfectly turned-out salmon over a barley pilaf, pan-seared flounder with leeks, tomato and capers and a chewy yet flavorful hanger steak with crunchy toasted gnocchi and spinach.,Speaking of gnocchi, the menu offers  these light potato dumplings in a flavor-packed sauce with tomato, zucchini, lemon and cheese, generously crowned  with grilled shrimp. (I counted nine in my dish.) Also hitting the high notes was fettuccine in a Bolognese sauce that had a bit of a spicy kick.,The eight-ounce Kobe burger was cooked medium-rare as ordered and came with terrific crisp fries and the desired sautÃ©ed onions but also sported a cap of unadvertised melted mozzarella. I would have preferred it without the  cheese.,Desserts also delivered. I loved the  New Orleans-style bread pudding with sourmash custard and the exceptionally moist and rich molten chocolate cake. A shortbread shortcake with mixed berries was another winner.,Servers were as excited about the new restaurant and its food as the diners were. On one evening, the service was nearly perfect; on a second night, our server was enthusiastic but tended to guess about ingredients rather than check with the kitchen. On  both nights, busboys did a great job refilling water glasses and replacing bread baskets with fresh ones. (The rolls in those baskets were just average, though.),The restaurant may look just like its predecessor, but the $25 three-course dinner makes this more than just the same old place with a new name., Striking yet sedate dining room with an aquarium and arresting curved panels of multicolored stained glass hanging from the ceiling. Complete wheelchair access.,Casual small groups and couples. Very few children., A wall of colored glass squares forms an ever-changing color and light show. There are a few cozy booths for two and an adjacent lounge area with leather chairs and  couch. Diverse wine list of 36 bottles, $22 to $35; 19 wines by the glass, $6 to $14., Three-course lunch, $10 or $15. Sunday brunch, $20,  includes a cocktail. Three-course dinner, $25 (higher Ã  la carte).

"Norma Turner, 14, is her motherâ€™s daughter. Her mother, Kareen Brown, held a recent portrait of the two of them, which showed  their striking resemblance.  The same eyes, same face, same tendrils of  hair, the same happiness shines out of the picture.,They also suffer from  a disorder  that puts them both at high risk for developing cancer and subjects them to numerous preventive operations. â€œItâ€™s in the family, the genes,â€ù Ms. Brown, 35, said.,In 2002, Ms. Brown  was sick. She was in the hospital, but she did not know what was causing the terrible pain in her stomach  or the bleeding from her rectum.,Norma, who keeps all the details of the treatment in order, told the story:   â€œShe felt something wet. She just got up and saw the bed was messed up with blood.â€ù,Ms. Brown had colon cancer. She was in the operating room before she even knew what was happening. Afterward, she spoke to the doctor. â€œHe said, â€˜Do you know what you have inside of you?â€™ I said, â€˜No,â€™ â€ù she remembered. â€œIt was a tumor. I was so sad.â€ù,â€œI didnâ€™t know what to do, like Iâ€™m lost,â€ù she continued. â€œI was saying, â€˜Iâ€™m going to die? Leave her? Whatâ€™s going to happen?â€™ It was scary. A lot of people die of cancer.â€ù,Ms. Brown received a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic condition that causes thousands of tiny polyps to develop on the wall of the colon.  If left untreated, the polyps usually develop into cancer.,â€œThey say it was just ready to spread. Iâ€™m lucky. Iâ€™m lucky,â€ù Ms. Brown said. But the polyps keep coming. Ms. Brown had four operations in as many years. From November 2005 to February 2006, a major  infection kept  her in the hospital. Norma lived with a great-aunt and Ms. Brown, on life support and unable to eat, lost 80 pounds.,Ms. Brown was the first in her family to receive the diagnosis. Her father, two brothers, and a twin sister  have the same disorder. In May, Norma also received a diagnosis of the disorder. The polyps in her colon would require surgery.,Ms. Brown said she was in disbelief after learning that her daughter would have to be operated on.  â€œOh my God, at the age of 14,â€ù Ms. Brown said. â€œShe was too young.â€ù,In September, Norma underwent a seven-hour surgery to remove the polyps. â€œThere was a 50-50 percent chance of me getting a colostomy bag,â€ù Norma said.,The night before the surgery, â€œThey put a tube up my nose and inserted it in my stomach,â€ù Norma said. It was awful, she said, adding that she remembered asking, â€œWhy did my grandfather have to have this sickness?â€ù,She does not remember much of that morning. â€œAll I remember, I said goodbye to my mother,â€ù she said. Ms. Brown added: â€œShe was strong. She was brave.â€ù,â€œI remember I woke up,â€ù Norma continued. â€œI remember seeing Stephanie there.â€ù Stephanie Mendell, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children, has been working with Norma since shortly after the disorder was diagnosed.,New Alternatives provides preventive services for families with medically fragile children and is a member agency of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The ,.,Because doctors were able to save enough of Normaâ€™s colon, she did not need a  colostomy bag. Every six months she will require a colonoscopy to check for polyps. Ms. Brown hopes that her own colostomy bag will  be removed this spring. But the disorder remains: doctors found two more polyps in Ms. Brownâ€™s intestines in December.,While struggling to treat the disease, Norma and Ms. Brown were also struggling with not having a stable home environment. In August 2005, they moved into a basement apartment in the Bronx after spending about six months in a homeless shelter.,The $825 rent is covered by Housing Stability Plus, a Department of Homeless Services program, and a preventive subsidy from the cityâ€™s Administration for Childrenâ€™s Services. Ms. Brownâ€™s monthly income is $178.50 from public assistance, supplemented with $144 in food stamps.,The disease should qualify her for Supplemental Security Income. But Ms. Brown, an immigrant from Jamaica and a legal resident, is not a citizen, which makes her ineligible. â€œShe canâ€™t qualify for S.S.I., and she absolutely canâ€™t work,â€ù said Ms. Mendell, who is helping her apply for citizenship.,This winter, $1,070 from Neediest Cases was used to buy them winter clothing, bedding and pajamas.  The money was also used to buy twin beds, an improvement over the one bed they had to share. â€œOne, Iâ€™m not kicking her,â€ù Norma said. â€œAnd two, weâ€™re not fighting for blankets.â€ù,Norma, an eighth grader, is still catching up on school work that she missed while she was recovering from surgery. â€œNormaâ€™s an amazing kid,â€ù said Ms. Mendell, noting the girlâ€™s resilience. â€œI just look at her as someone with a lot of potential, who really wants to do well, and can do well, given the right opportunity.â€ù",,"JAN. 27, 2007","In Fighting Disorder, Family Stays Vigilant",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/nyregion/27neediest.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thereâ€™s an autumnal air surrounding  â€œThe Cocktail Hour,â€ù A. R. Gurneyâ€™s 1988 play,  and not just because of the necklace of orange and brown leaves encircling the Long Wharf stage. The play deals with a waning world. Two, in fact.,Mr. Gurney still writes wonderfully thoughtful and witty plays that range widely in theme and subject matter. But his best-known works are those that chronicle the withering of what we must call, for lack of a better term, WASP America. Itâ€™s an America well known in ,, where itâ€™s easy to imagine the Prescott Bushes saying things like â€œDonâ€™t be unattractiveâ€ù to one another as they sip Scotch before dinner, their living room filled with antiques and the piano topped with family photos.,Long Wharfâ€™s first-rate revival  takes place in just such a living room (courtesy of Michael Yeargan, the set designer), and while the family having drinks includes neither senators nor presidents-to-be, Mr. Gurney deftly conveys the way Americaâ€™s ruling elite maintained its place at the head of the social, political and economic pecking order through much of the 20th century. Sons who might have preferred to build boats went into business instead. Daughters who might have preferred to go to work stayed instead to tend the home fires. Wives aching for adventure doused their desires with alcohol.,And everyone followed the rules: You didnâ€™t use a word like â€œpenisâ€ù in the living room; you avoided self-scrutiny of any kind, especially the kind abetted by psychiatrists; you didnâ€™t sell your blue chips, ever; and you didnâ€™t sully the graceful flow of conversation with anything as jarring as a fact.,Similar rules applied in the theater you went to. But like John, whose visit home is the occasion for the cocktails in â€œThe Cocktail Hour,â€ù Mr. Gurney has lost patience with the rules. So he bends them: John has returned to ask his parents, Bradley and Ann, for permission to mount the play he has written about them â€” a play that sounds suspiciously like the one weâ€™re watching.,So there are two narratives unfolding here. One is Mr. Gurneyâ€™s gently acerbic take on Bradley and Ann; their docile daughter, Nina; and their not-so-docile son John, who , use the word â€œpenisâ€ù in the living room. The other is Mr. Gurneyâ€™s slyly amusing commentary on the play he has written â€” the script sits on the coffee table throughout the performance â€” and on theater itself. And both are very well served in this production, directed by Long Wharfâ€™s associate artistic director, Kim Rubinstein.,Ms. Rubinstein gets special credit for hiring John Cunningham to play the old-school dad â€” a poseur whoâ€™s also the real deal, a skinflint whoâ€™s also ready to write a $20,000 check to get his son to do what he wants. Mr. Cunningham, mixing drinks at the crystal-laden bar cart in tweed jacket and plaid tie, embodies these contradictions with ease. Never losing his cool, he reveals Bradleyâ€™s shifts in feeling with tiny alterations in body language and inflection. It is a commanding performance by an actor perhaps born to play this character.,Matching him nearly stroke for stroke is Mary Beth Peil as Ann. The role was played Off Broadway by the imposingly grand Nancy Marchand. Ms. Peilâ€™s Ann is more delicate, still ravishingly pretty and something of a coquette. In a navy blue twin set accented with a rope of pearls, her hair in an elegant French twist, she folds herself neatly into a chair, the picture of a proper lady. But her eyes sparkle with something hidden, a possibly naughty secret that John is determined to pry from her.,At first glance, it looks as though the productionâ€™s impeccable casting goes awry in the younger generation. Rob Campbell and Ann Talman donâ€™t really look like they could be the children of this Bradley and Ann. Heâ€™s too swarthy and scruffy (the rumpled jeans donâ€™t help) and sheâ€™s too blunt and prickly. But they so completely inhabit their characters â€” he with an exquisitely aware irony, she with an emphatic heartiness â€” that you soon wonder why you ever thought they werenâ€™t family.,Mr. Gurneyâ€™s wonderful ear for dialogue keeps the play rippling along, like one of those flowing conversations Bradley prizes. And the bifurcated structure adds a layer of double entendre that sharpens even the more mundane exchanges about the play-within-the-play.,With a golden blush outside the living room windows, the dimmer, contrasting hues of the interior and the leanly upholstered furniture, Ms. Rubinstein, Mr. Yeargan and their lighting designer, Pat Collins, have given the play a Chekhovian melancholy that feels very right but doesnâ€™t detract from its many laughs.,And its many laughs donâ€™t detract from its ultimate truth â€” a truth thatâ€™s been underlined in the years since Mr. Gurney wrote it. John tells his father that the play he has written looks at their family with â€œwarmth, respect and an abiding affection.â€ù What he canâ€™t say, because itâ€™s only 1988, is something that struck at least one viewer:  that the father-son  struggle  in the play can shed some unexpected light on father-son relationships everywhere â€” including those with wider implications.",SYLVIANE GOLD,"JAN. 28, 2007",An America Where Much Was Left Unsaid,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/28cttheater.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are diners and there are diners, but few like Whiteâ€™s Diner in Bridgeport, which has been owned for 30 years by the same couple â€” Greg and Linda Cerminara, with Greg in charge of the cooking. They kept the name Whiteâ€™s (for the original owner, who opened the diner around 1935), and over time the place has become a local institution.,â€œWe still have some of our original patrons,â€ù Ms. Cerminara said.,Now their children and grandchildren come  for the traditional diner  fare â€” super-large cholesterol-be-darned breakfasts featuring more than a dozen omelets (try the spinach and feta cheese) and other egg dishes, griddlecakes and French toast, and sides like bacon, sausage, ham and  home fries. A favorite omelet is the Farmerâ€™s Market, with onions, peppers, tomatoes, bacon, ham and sausage, at $7.95.

", who developed a national reputation for decisive and reassuring leadership after 9/11, now faces the odd challenge of having to reassure some supporters that he can be decisive about a very different issue: running for president.,Even as his fellow Republican John McCain and fellow New Yorker Hillary Rodham Clinton have all but formally declared their candidacies, Mr. Giuliani has proceeded more cautiously.,Since last month, he has formed an exploratory committee, more aggressively recruited a campaign staff and moved to divest himself of one of his companies. And he is  now visiting New Hampshire, home to the first primary, for the second time in three months. But he has studiously avoided making a public commitment to run.,Asked recently in Delaware about his political plans, he offered an ambiguous reply: â€œI think the biggest question you have to ask is, â€˜Can you really lead the country?â€™ If I believe that I can do it, then I will, and if I donâ€™t, then Iâ€™ll support somebody else.â€ù,He ducked the question again yesterday, telling reporters in Bretton Woods, N.H., that he would not be rushed by contenders who are already entering the race. â€œYou should do it when you feel itâ€™s the right time,â€ù he said.,Despite the delay, his aides argue that the accelerated pace of early primaries next year actually benefits a well-established figure like Mr. Giuliani â€” much, they say, as his national stature will enable him to close whatever gaps now exist in fund-raising and organization.,Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant who is not now working for any of the presidential campaigns, described Mr. Giuliani as â€œthe only candidate who can set his own timetable, because he is so established in the minds of the voters.â€ù,Nonetheless, doubts have been raised about the proverbial fire in his belly. Some New Yorkers in particular recall his decision to quit the Senate race against Mrs. Clinton in 2000 after running for months and raising millions of dollars but never formally declaring his candidacy.,Mr. Giuliani, already hobbled then by a messy separation from his wife, withdrew after finding that he had prostate cancer. But he was also ambivalent about the prospect of being a legislator.,Wrestling then with which course of medical treatment to pursue,  he said on the day he withdrew: â€œAnd about the decision to run: I was almost in the same position, not being able to make it, which has never really happened to me. Iâ€™ve always been able to make decisions.â€ù,David Garth, a media consultant who helped steer the Giuliani mayoral campaigns, said that while he had no reason to doubt a candidacy this time, â€œitâ€™s a question of where his head is, as it was in the Senate race.â€ù,Michael R. Long, chairman of the New York State Conservative Party, voiced uncertainty.,â€œHe called me before Thanksgiving just to touch base and said heâ€™d like to talk, and I havenâ€™t heard from him since,â€ù Mr. Long said. â€œWe went through this in the United States Senate race. Whether he pulls the trigger or not, I donâ€™t know.â€ù,Fred Siegel, a Cooper Union historian and Giuliani biographer, dismissed the analogy to 2000. â€œThe question is there in Washington,â€ù Mr. Siegel said, but â€œI think itâ€™s mistaken.â€ù,Mr. Giulianiâ€™s aides maintain that he is being held to a standard different from that of other prospective candidates who have not formally declared. And anyway, they say, his ambivalence, whether real or merely perceived, may well vanish soon. Mr. Giuliani, who will address  the Republican State Convention in New Hampshire today, is to travel to California and South Carolina next month, and supporters in New Jersey are preparing to announce endorsements next week.,California and New Jersey are two of a number of populous states that are expected to shift their 2008 primaries to February, very early in the campaign season, and South Carolinaâ€™s comes even earlier, a week after New Hampshireâ€™s.,â€œFolks who believe he is not running do so at their own peril,â€ù said Michael DuHaime, former political director of the Republican National Committee, who is heading Mr. Giulianiâ€™s exploratory effort.,â€œThere is a spin out there that the campaign is further behind than it is, that Rudy may not be serious, and that is being done deliberately to keep us from certain fund-raisers,â€ù said Mr. DuHaime, a native New Jerseyan who begins working for Mr. Giuliani full time next week.,Kieran Mahoney, a Republican consultant in New York who is working for another presidential prospect, former Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, said he had been unconvinced of a Giuliani run until recently, when the former mayor stepped up the pace of hiring a campaign staff and reports emerged that he had taken steps to sell the biggest division of his consulting business.,â€œStop listening to what they say and look at their behavior,â€ù Mr. Mahoney said of potential candidates in general. â€œGiuliani is, in fact, an active participant in the marketplace in terms of scooping up talent and making business decisions that are economically injurious and politically positive. I have been a skeptic. I am now a believer.â€ù,Even Mr. Giuliani himself, though continuing to demur, did drop a hint or two in New Hampshire yesterday, saying at a Chamber of Commerce dinner  that he might return later this year to play golf, or for other reasons.,Some consultants to Mr. Giulianiâ€™s rivals, and even some of his supporters, say that given the campaignâ€™s relatively late start, his inner circle may be overconfident about his ability to build a respectable war chest by March 31, the first of the deadlines for reporting campaign contributions. A poor sum  then would make it all the harder to attract further donations, and, with more candidates now choosing not to participate in the federal campaign financing system, the importance of fund-raising has increased, as has competition for the  millions at stake.,Already, Mr. Giuliani is being measured against a 140-page game plan drafted by a member of his campaign staff last fall. That document, which Giuliani advisers say was stolen from them, set a fund-raising goal of at least $25 million by the end of March, but some potential fund-raisers and donors whom it identified have already enlisted in support of other candidates.,Asked about the $25 million figure, Mr. DuHaime, who did not join the campaign until after the document was drafted, replied: â€œWhat is important to us is we have a strong number in that first period, and Iâ€™m not going to put the number out there publicly. Weâ€™re certain weâ€™re going to have enough money to be competitive.â€ù,In New Jersey, where two fund-raisers have been scheduled and a spectrum of local politicians are expected to endorse Mr. Giuliani next week, one supporter, Steven E. Some, said that he had worked in five presidential campaigns and that â€œselling Rudy is the easiest sell Iâ€™ve ever had in my life.â€ù,â€œI have no doubt whatever that heâ€™s in this for the long term,â€ù said Mr. Some, a veteran  political consultant. â€œIâ€™ve never had anyone come up to me to raise any doubt about whether heâ€™s going to go the course.â€ù,Still, an underlying perception exists, and is being stoked, that Mr. Giuliani has not committed himself to a campaign, in part because he is reluctant to relinquish the lucrative consulting business that he founded after he left the mayorâ€™s office five years ago. Referring to Mr. Giulianiâ€™s exploratory activity, Harold M. Ickes, a longtime adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said, â€œI thought he was just advertising so he can increase his fees.â€ù,Mr. Mahoney, the Republican consultant, acknowledged that one challenge facing Mr. Giuliani would be determining how to expand his political base rightward.,â€œIn order to become the mayor of New York City,â€ù Mr. Mahoney said, â€œyou have to do things that are not wholly consistent with being the Republican nominee for president.â€ù",SAM ROBERTS,"JAN. 27, 2007",Giuliani Is Cautious as He Weighs â€™08 Decision,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/us/politics/27rudy.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Intel, the worldâ€™s largest chip maker,  has overhauled the basic building block of the information age, paving the way for a new generation of faster and more energy-efficient processors.,Company researchers said the advance represented the most significant change in the materials used to manufacture silicon chips since Intel pioneered the modern integrated-circuit transistor more than four decades ago.,The microprocessor chips, which Intel plans to begin making in the second half of this year, are designed for computers but they could also have applications in consumer devices. Their combination of processing power and energy efficiency could make it possible, for example, for cellphones to play video at length â€” a demanding digital task â€” with less battery drain.,The work by Intel overcomes a potentially crippling technical obstacle that has arisen as a transistorâ€™s tiny switches are made ever smaller: their tendency to leak current as the insulating material gets thinner. The Intel advance uses new metallic alloys in the insulation itself and in adjacent components.,Word of the announcement, which is planned for Monday, touched off a war of dueling statements as I.B.M. rushed to announce that  it was on the verge of a similar advance.,I.B.M. executives said their company was planning to introduce a comparable type of transistor in the first quarter of 2008.,Many industry analysts say that Intel retains a six-month to nine-month lead over the rest of the industry, but I.B.M. executives disputed the claim and said the two companies were focused on different markets in the computing industry.,The I.B.M. technology has been developed in partnership with Advanced Micro Devices, Intelâ€™s main rival. Modern microprocessor and memory chips are created from an interconnected fabric of hundreds of millions and even billions of the tiny switches that process the  ones and zeros that are the foundation of digital computing.,They are made using a manufacturing process that has been constantly improving for more than four decades. Today transistors, for example, are made with systems that can create wires and other features that are finer than the resolving power of a single wavelength of light.,The Intel announcement is new evidence that the chip maker is maintaining the pace of Mooreâ€™s Law, the technology axiom that states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years, giving rise to a constant escalation of computing power at lower costs.,â€œThis is evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary, but it will generate a big sigh of relief,â€ù said Vivek Subramanian, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.,For several decades there have been repeated warnings about the impending end of the Mooreâ€™s Law pace for chip makers. In response the semiconductor industry has repeatedly found its way around fundamental technical obstacles, inventing techniques that at times seem to defy basic laws of physics.,The chip industry measures its progress by manufacturing standards defined by a width of one of the smallest features of a transistor for each generation. Currently much of the industry is building chips in what is known as 90-nanometer technology. At that scale, about 1,000 transistors would fit in the width of a human hair. Intel began making chips at 65 nanometers in 2005, about nine months before its closest competitors.,Now the company is moving on to the next stage of refinement, defined by a minimum feature size of 45 nanometers. Other researchers have recently reported progress on molecular computing technologies that could reduce the scale even further by the end of the decade.,Intelâ€™s imminent advance to 45 nanometers will have a huge impact on the industry, Mr. Subramanian said.   â€œPeople have been working on it for over a decade, and this is tremendously significant that Intel has made it work,â€ù he said.,Intelâ€™s advance was in part in finding a new insulator composed of an alloy of hafnium, a metallic element that has previously been used in filaments and electrodes and as a neutron absorber in nuclear power plants. They will replace the use of silicon dioxide â€” essentially the material that window glass is made of, but only several atoms thick.,Intel is also shifting to new metallic alloy materials â€” it is not identifying them specifically â€” in transistor components known as gates, which sit directly on top of the insulator. These are ordinarily made from a particular form of silicon called polysilicon.,The new approach to insulation appears at least temporarily to conquer one of the most significant obstacles confronting the semiconductor industry: the tendency of tiny switches to leak electricity as they are reduced in size. The leakage makes chips run hotter and consume more power.,Many executives in the industry say  that Intel is still recovering from a strategic wrong turn it made when the company pushed its chips to extremely high clock speeds â€” the ability of a processor to calculate more quickly. That obsession with speed at any cost left the company behind its competitors in shifting to low-power alternatives.,Now Intel is coming back. Although the chip maker led in the speed race for many years, the company has in recent years shifted its focus to low-power microprocessors that gain speed by breaking up each chip into multiple computing â€œcores.â€ù In its new 45-nanometer generation, Intel will gain the freedom to seek either higher performance or substantially lower power, while at the same time increasing the number of cores per chip.,â€œThey can adjust the transistor for high performance or low power,â€ù said David Lammers, director of ,, a Web portal for technical professionals.,The Intel development effort has gone on in a vast automated factory in Hillsboro, Ore., that the company calls D1D. It features huge open manufacturing rooms that are kept surgically clean to prevent dust from contaminating the silicon wafers that are whisked around the factory by a robotic conveyor system.,The technology effort was led by Mark T.  Bohr, a longtime Intel physicist who is director of process architecture and integration. The breakthrough, he said, was in finding a way to deal with the leakage of current. â€œUp until five years ago, leakage was thought to increase with each generation,â€ù he said.,Several analysts said that the technology advance could give Intel a meaningful advantage over competitors in the race to build ever more powerful microprocessors.,â€œItâ€™s going to be a nightmare for Intelâ€™s competitors,â€ù said G. Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSI Research. â€œA lot of Mark Bohrâ€™s counterparts are going to wake up in terror.â€ù,An I.B.M. executive said yesterday that the company had also chosen hafnium as its primary  insulator, but that it would not release details of its new process until technical papers are presented  at coming conferences.,â€œItâ€™s the difference between can openers and Ferraris,â€ù said Bernard S. Meyerson, vice president and chief technologist for the systems and technology group at I.B.M. He insisted that industry analysts who have asserted that Intel has a technology lead are not accurate and that I.B.M. had simply chosen to deploy its new process in chips that are part of high-performance systems aimed at the high end of the computer industry.,Intel said it had already manufactured prototype microprocessor chips in the new 45-nanometer process that run on three major operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and  Linux.",JOHN MARKOFF,"JAN. 27, 2007","Intel Says Chips Will Run Faster, Using Less Power",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/technology/27chip.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ONE of the few times I have seen Paul Newman in person was at dinner at Luna, on the grounds of the Westport Country Playhouse. He was at the table next to mine â€” and now he and a new chef run the place, which opened last fall, totally revamped and renamed Dressing Room.,The new look conveys sophisticated rusticity, with a roaring fire, vintage wood floors, and swags of dried magnolia leaves and gigantic sugar pine cones looped along the walls, interspersed with Playhouse posters.,Subtitled â€œA Homegrown Restaurant,â€ù Dressing Room features the cooking of Michel Nischan,  a co-owner and an experienced chef who once ran Miche Mache in South Norwalk and North Stamford. The menu emphasizes fresh, seasonal, mostly organic foods in wholesome dishes, usually with a modern twist, often made with local ingredients.,Oysters, as a starter, are from ,. The feta cheese in the spoon salad is from Sankowâ€™s Beaver Brook Farm in Lyme and the varied artisanal cheeses as a dessert choice are from Cato Corner Farm in Colchester.,In the hands of an imaginative chef like Mr. Nischan, wholesome is anything but boring. Three delicious appetizers prove the point. Fried calamari, lightly battered, are enlivened by soft cheese grits and Cape gooseberries. Kona Kampachi,  a farmed fish, forms a tartare with chopped oysters, shallots, fresh chives and extra virgin olive oil. Best of all, though it sounds mundane, is the Maryland crab cocktail â€”  attractive clusters of fresh crabmeat alongside tiny portions of pumpkin-seed frissÃ©e salad and rutabaga sauerkraut, with a cumin accent, in a tangy blood-orange dressing.,A really special dish, farro, a cereal grain similar to spelt, is available as an entree with butternut squash and truffles. I ordered it as a side, prepared risotto-style, with foraged mushrooms and a foam of mascarpone cheese. The farroâ€™s nutty flavor and firmness worked well with the mushrooms.,Another pleasing combination was Berkshire pig, consisting of three cuts of pork  â€” prime roasting cut, prime braising cut and seared pork belly, served with a pungent parsnip horseradish purÃ©e and large heirloom shell beans in natural pan juices.,Accessories at Dressing Room are often unusual  â€” wilted kale, collard greens, brussels sprouts, parsnips, salsify.  But sometimes  they overwhelm the main attraction, like the simply grilled John Dory fish, drowned out  by the collard greens and salsify in ham hock stock that accompanied it.,A better combination was paper-thin slices of Coxâ€™s Orange Pippin apples layered with pan-roasted trout, garnished with creamy scalloped potatoes.,Desserts, a Nischan specialty, make grand finales. Especially rich was the chocolate bread pudding. Sticky toffee pudding with red wine-soaked poached pear and maple ice cream was also memorable. My favorite was lemon meringue pie, a miniature individual tart with a piquant lemon-sour cream filling, mile-high meringue and a crust that looked commercial but was buttery, house-made and superb.,Almost everything is made on the premises, from the ketchup used in the loose-textured Dressing Room meatloaf and the cured bacon on the P. L. Newman burger to all the ice creams and sour cherry sorbet. But the  excellent sourdough breads come from the SoNo Baking Company in South Norwalk.,Dressing Room is off to a flying start and what promises to be an extended run., A houselike building of vivid-green clapboard with  a front terrace, next to the Westport Country Playhouse. The first of two handsome dining rooms has high ceilings, post-and-beam construction and a stone fireplace; the rear room has banquettes, oak barn-siding walls and an exposed-beam ceiling.

Gathered at the townâ€™s  lakeside pavilion, a century-old dance hall scheduled to be destroyed at the end of the evening in the name of progress, are members of the class of 1986:  the Boy Most Likely to Succeed, now a Microsoft millionaire; the Girl With the Best Sense of Humor, still single; and, most important,  both halves of the Cutest Senior Couple.,The lives of the couple in question took  separate paths on a  fateful September day when Peter went out of town to college,  leaving Kari pregnant and facing an ,.,Kari is tenderly played  by Kate Eastwood Norris as a woman determined to cope. With her face frozen in a wan smile of regret, she clutches her sweater closed as though trying to hide  her broken heart. Still working at the bank, down in the basement among the safe-deposit boxes, and still married to Hans, the local golf pro who rescued her in her time of need, she hates golf almost as much as she despises the memory of Peter and their unborn child.,The desperately clueless Peter, played   by Erik Steele, went to graduate school to become  a shrink. Lonely, unable to establish any meaningful relationships except with artistic 20-somethings, he remains  obsessed with the idea of reconnecting with Kari. He actually appears at the dance with a bouquet of flowers clutched in his hand, seeking forgiveness.

"WHEN the Flying Pig first flew into Mount Kiscoâ€™s Metro-North station house, the concept of a market-cafe emphasizing fresh local and organic products was laudable, and it still is. But those wings wilted as the ambitious owners tried to accomplish too many missions in a small, ungainly space.,In early December, the Pig took off again, this time settling into  roomier quarters last occupied by Cafe Antico. The basic architectural details remain intact â€” the barrel ceiling of the upper floor and the glass walls wrapping the first-floor dining area â€” but the new Pig is a more sober affair. Gone is Anticoâ€™s dazzle of ornate candelabras, strings of glittery pin lights and masses of candles â€” an atmosphere that canâ€™t quite be replaced by the collection of pig figures and figurines. The new ownershipâ€™s commitment to serving nutritious, chemical-free food is a serious one, and it may be that the pared-down dÃ©cor better delivers the earnest message.,Most of the Flying Pigâ€™s meat and vegetable products come from Cabbage Hill Farm, a local supplier that, like the restaurantâ€™s other sources, is committed to the humane treatment of free-ranging livestock and the cultivation of pesticide-free vegetables. Quality  like this goes a long way but doesnâ€™t always guarantee the success of a dish.,During my recent visits, the cooking  wasnâ€™t as vigilant as it could be and lacked consistency. At best, promised herbs were absent; at worst, much of a rib-eye steak was globby fat. But this new Flying Pig is still coming to terms with the responsibilities involved in running a full-scale restaurant. Meanwhile, it makes a sunny destination for lunch â€” perhaps a sandwich and a bowl of thick, purÃ©ed vegetable soup, delicious and warming. And dinner had some high points as well.,A couple of starters proved quite satisfying. Although the promised rosemary was undetectable, grilled shrimp were still appealing under a light wash of lemony broth and on a bed of cannellini beans and shredded arugula; and the liquor from small, tasty mussels mingled with wine sauce and garlic into a broth that sopped nicely with good toasted bread â€” a lusty dish.,Chopped salad contained carrots, romaine, sweet red onions, Maytag blue cheese and lentils (lentils and beans seem to crop up in most dishes). On one occasion the salad was dressed with a wine vinaigrette that was perfectly balanced;  on another visit it was stingingly astringent.,A mountain of gorgeous fresh parsley and a scattering of pignoli and pomegranate seeds took grilled portobellos under a melt of Parmesan out of the ordinary. But the sautÃ©ed bits of calamari in another appetizer were a tad tough.,An entree of flat maltagliati pasta (the name means badly cut) with meaty Bolognese sauce was hearty and homey (a half portion as an  appetizer can be arranged). Other creditable dishes included salt-roasted salmon, the salt crust (removed before being served) capturing all the juiciness and flavor of the fish as it roasted. And hanger steak turned out to be a wonderful piece of meat. The two-inch-thick cut was grilled perfectly to medium rare; mashed Yukon golds and strings of fried onion shared the plate. The excellence of this steak made the fatty rib-eye mentioned earlier all the more puzzling. This rib-eye was also cut in a wedge, the thin end overdone and dry. Adding to the disaster were leathery outer leaves of onion and tough leaves of spinach.,The pig motif, most apparent on the upper floor, might make some diners uneasy, especially if theyâ€™ve ordered the pork loin. The fact is that this meat was fabulously tender, flavorful and juicy, a winner sided by a fluffy mash of potato and celery root.,For dessert. the sticky toffee pudding, lighter than most,  was truly luxurious when served with a scoop of ice cream.

Hand-hewn wooden bins are filled with fresh-dried pastas like  cavatelli, spaghetti and fettuccine ($2.50 a pound).,Prepared foods include hearty Italian classics, mostly sold frozen:  sausage, peppers and onions ($6 a pound);  stuffed shells ($4); ravioli ($5); lasagna ($6); and manicotti with meat sauce ($6).,Customers  arrive with coolers to  fill  with roasted peppers and marinated mushrooms ($6 a pound), imported sun-dried tomatoes ($8.99), olives ($5), and cheeses from Italy like  Locatelli Romano ($8.99) and Parmigiano Reggiano ($14). Others stop  for a wedge of Asiago cheese,  which they grate over pasta or just eat  with crackers ($8.99).,Although he has been the deliâ€™s sole owner for three years, Mr. Clemente was previously a partner  for more than 30  years. â€œWeâ€™ve been doing the same thing since Day One,â€ù  he said.,Some add Gorgonzola ($8.99 a pound) and fresh mascarpone cheese ($8 a pound) to their pasta;  others eat sliced  provolone  ($10.99) with fresh pears.,â€œOur customers seem to buy the same thing week after week,â€ù said John Finamore, a member of the staff  who has been serving the public for 20  years.  Favorites include  the imported meats: soppressata (imported dried Italian  salami, $10 a pound), mortadella (Italian bologna, $6),  capicola (cured salami, $10)  and, of course, prosciutto ($14).,Sandwiches  are a big attraction, like the one  with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, capicola and roasted peppers, drizzled with balsamic vinegar on a roll ($5).

"WHEN I last had fondue, it was at a bustling place in Geneva,  where the supercilious waiter knew we were tourists and treated us accordingly. I declared then  that I wouldnâ€™t be craving bread dunked in melted  cheese for a very long time.,A very long time turned out to be 16 months. But this time I didnâ€™t have to endure  an all-night flight and navigate a foreign language. Pheasants Landing, which has a Swiss chef, Andre Gross,  serves a fine  fondue and several other tasty dishes as well.,The restaurant is owned by Heinz Keller, who closed his Auberge Swiss in  Berkeley Heights  in 2001  to open this party-friendly place in Hillsborough the following year, according to  Vicky Starace, the  manager. Set well off the road and surrounded by  lawns,  it is brightly lighted and easily seen from a distance. Parking is plentiful, but first-timers are left wondering how to get in, because there are no signs directing diners to the entrance, in the back.,Inside,  the mood warms considerably. Floors are honeyed wood, lighting is hearthlike, and rooms are home-scale.,A cheese fondue seemed equally cozy,  and it was. Spiked with Kirschwasser (a cherry liqueur) and white wine, it  was served with bread and apples for dipping, and did double duty as food and conversation piece. Thereâ€™s a proper way to stir fondue,  with a queenly wave,  a  figure-eight motion,  to keep it from sticking on the bottom, said one member of our party. Then there was the discussion of etiquette surrounding the retrieval of food gone missing in the depths.,Appetizers, which lent themselves to  less social interaction,  were successful anyway. They  included a duck pÃ¢tÃ© with its fruity Cumberland sauce and accompanying salad of celery and walnuts;  roasted red peppers over fresh mozzarella,  drizzled with a basil vinaigrette; and  Swiss onion soup, topped with Emmenthal cheese.,The Caesar salad was more compelling than the Greek version, possibly because the Parmesan used in the Caesar was more noticeable   than the feta in the Greek. Crab cakes were overly seasoned and overworked, with no visible chunks of meat; house-made spinach dumplings were delicately flavored, once  they had been fished from their sea of sauce. The pasta encircling a  pheasant filling in the ravioli special, however, was less than tender.,Main dishes were more consistent, particularly the European specialties:   the slab of tender sauerbraten, marinated steak,  in brown gravy, accompanied by  a heap of steaming hot spaetzle  and marinated red cabbage; the hunter schnitzel, a tender disc of fried veal  served with a typical Burgundy-mushroom sauce, again with cabbage and spaetzle; and  the wiener schnitzel, the fried veal  without the gravy.,There were a few standouts  among the game specials, which are offered  in winter  and change weekly. Venison stew was delicious,  the meat made tender by a red wine marinade and braising with mushrooms, pearl onions and bacon and served with more of the spaetzle. A close second was the game sampler, which included a sweetish smoked duck sausage infused with apple brandy,  a tender venison loin  and wild boar medallions wrapped in bacon.,A New York strip steak was nicely cooked as well, though the garlic mashed potatoes seemed rote next to the beautiful, golden-brown, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside rÃ¶sti, a  Swiss version of hash browns that was enriched with bacon and onions. Pheasant, however, was a disappointment,  overcooked and dry on two separate visits.,Among the many menu items I didnâ€™t try,  the fish and chips, made with cod  in a beer batter, is atop my list. The best bet for dessert is not the house-made apple strudel, which had  a floppy crust and steaming filling, but Mr. Grossâ€™s   walnut and caramel-fudge tart. Order it when you place your meal order  and ask the server to allow your piece to sit out of the refrigerator during dinner. That way the flavors  enhance  each other  â€” just the way the satisfying food at Pheasants Landing complements a winter evening., Intimate and cozy,  with room for large and small groups. Complete wheelchair access., Convivial and casual; friendly, helpful servers;  few children were seen, but they would feel at home here.

"An imposing wooden Bigfoot statue stolen from outside a chiropractorâ€™s office was recovered on Thursday â€” minus its big feet.

"IN the 1890s, Louis Seitz built three singular apartment houses in ,: the Imperial, at Pacific Street and Bedford Avenue; the Alhambra, at Nostrand Avenue and Macon Street; and the Renaissance, at Nostrand and Hancock Street.,As decades passed, each building went to a different owner. But all followed the downward path that overtook much of Brooklyn; a century later, they were disintegrating.,Under the supervision of the cityâ€™s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, they have now been rebuilt by  developers who have remained faithful to the originals, at least on the exterior. The buildings in their infancy catered to a wealthy clientele, but today most of the apartments are for moderate- or low-income tenants.,Born in 1860, Mr. Seitz left school at 16 and worked in a wholesale business of some sort before going into real estate in 1884.,The masterpiece of his trio, built in 1889, was the wild and woolly Alhambra. The blocklong building was set back 15 feet from Nostrand Avenue, with six towers, arcaded balconies, a garden and a croquet lawn. It mixed several styles, and in 1890, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said it â€œmight best be described as Morrisian,â€ù an allusion to the pyrotechnics of Mr. Seitzâ€™s architect, Montrose Morris. The five-story building, which cost $200,000, had a resident engineer and 32 apartments of 8 to 10 rooms. It was instantly one of Brooklynâ€™s best apartment houses.,Two years later, Mr. Seitz and Mr. Morris completed two near twins: the Imperial, several blocks south in Crown Heights, and the Renaissance, a block north of the Alhambra.,According to an 1892 issue of The Eagle, Mr. Seitz told Mr. Morris to prepare plans for the Imperial regardless of cost, in order to make â€œa monument handsome beyond compare.â€ù And that monument, at Pacific and Bedford, is wonderfully rambunctious, its triple outsize turrets and pointed roofs like the three musketeers backed into a corner, swords flailing.,Although the exterior walls meet at right angles, the plot is slightly acute â€” perhaps only 80 degrees instead of the usual 90 â€” which animates the facade in a way seen in few other buildings. The whole is dominated by triple-height arches, topped by an irregular attic story, its slate roofs crowded together as if jockeying for position.,The Alhambra is in a moody palette of orange and brown and red, while the Imperial turned the corner of the new Renaissance style, airy and light in soft yellow and buff brick and terra cotta. Two-story-high fluted columns give the later building a Roman pomp. In 1892, The Eagle called it â€œan architectural dream in cream and white,â€ù generally patterned after McKim, Mead & Whiteâ€™s Hotel Imperial, which once stood at 32nd Street and Broadway in ,.,The 1892 Renaissance, at Nostrand Avenue and Hancock Street, is essentially the same as the Imperial, although less operatic.,An 1893 book, â€œThe Eagle and Brooklyn,â€ù singled out Mr. Seitzâ€™s efforts, noting his â€œdiscriminating artistic senseâ€ù and saying he had revolutionized the Brooklyn apartment market. Andrew Scott Dolkart, who has studied the career of Montrose Morris extensively, calls him one of Brooklynâ€™s great 19th-century architects.,In an 1899 account, The Eagle called the Imperial â€œone of the finest apartments in Brooklynâ€ù; in 1901, it reported that the 25 seven-room apartments each rented for $60 a month. According to the 1905 , census, tenants had occupations like lawyer, exporter, engineer and stockbroker.,By the 1970s, all three buildings were on the skids. The city took possession of the Imperial in 1979, because its taxes had not been paid. An article in The New York Times in 1983 estimated the buildingâ€™s expenses at $67,000 a year, while reporting that the rent roll could not have exceeded $57,000.,The buildings were designated landmarks in 1986, but within a decade the Renaissance was vacant, the Alhambra had only stores as occupants (much of its roof had collapsed from a fire), and the Imperial had only a few tenants.,Rebuilding work on the Alhambra and the Renaissance took place in the 1990s, but the Imperial did not reopen until last October, after a $6.3 million gut renovation similar to the those at the Alhambra and the Imperial.,There is no longer anything historic about any of the interiors, which are plain white and could be in a postwar building on Third Avenue in Manhattan. But in the Imperial some of the two- and three-bedroom apartments retain some original character because they occupy the turrets. A fifth-floor apartment at the northwest corner, with distant views of the Manhattan skyline, is now available at $1,800 a month at market rate, or as low as $700 for prospective tenants who meet certain income guidelines.,Outside, the buildingâ€™s developer, Larry Hirschfield, the president of ELH Management, has delivered interesting results. The masonry has been cleaned, but not too harshly, preserving the dings and nicks of time that give a building character. The slate roofs were kept intact, not rebuilt in modern materials, which would have removed more of the buildingâ€™s patina.,Mr. Hirschfield also had to reproduce much of the copper work in the triple-height window bays. But instead of either cleaning the old copper to look new, or patinating the replacement copper to look old, he left old and new together, so some parts are aged green and others are shiny brown â€” a bit odd, but thatâ€™s how old buildings often look in real life.,So the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has saved the shells of Mr. Seitzâ€™s three signature buildings from disaster and now can make some claim on the same kind of revolution he created in the 1890s.",CHRISTOPHER GRAY,"JAN. 28, 2007","Three Singular Brooklyn Buildings, Each With a Second Chance",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/realestate/28scap.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MONTAUK, the hamlet on the end of ,â€™s South Fork, has been a rustic un-Hampton summer destination for more than 50 years. But two new projects  suggest that Montauk may be heading for year-round status, and the recent sale of a former celebrity retreat has also put a spotlight on the hamlet.,A new condop â€” a co-op complex with condominium-style rules  â€” is under construction in Montauk on the site of the Panoramic View Hotel on Old Montauk Highway. The property, still operating as a hotel, has more than 1,000 feet of sandy beach on the Atlantic Ocean. The condop is a complete renovation of the hotel.,The developer, Distinctive Ventures, hopes to attract young , families who want a year-round getaway, but not the bustle and hype of East Hampton and Southampton, according to Adam Manson, a company spokesman.,When completed, the 75-unit complex, to be called Panoramic Villas, will have a full-service concierge, an outdoor heated pool and a fitness center. A mixture of two-, three- and four-bedroom duplexes and some triplexes, ranging in size from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet, is planned. If buyers donâ€™t have time to decorate, Mr. Manson said, they can choose from a variety of furniture packages and accessories, including â€œeverything from table cutlery to napkins in the kitchen ready to use.â€ù,The units, which will start at $1.5 million, will also have oak floors, hot tubs and flat-panel televisions, and granite counters and expensive appliances, Mr. Manson added.,Buyers will purchase shares in the complex, but there are no board  approvals, and owners can sublet the units anytime, Mr. Manson said.,Distinctive Ventures plans to start selling the first 27 units of the project this spring, and the units will be ready by fall, Mr. Manson said.,The company believes that wealthier second-home buyers who want year-round services are heading for Montauk. Clues came from the companyâ€™s research of Montaukâ€™s rental market, Mr. Manson said.,â€œA lot of rentals in the last few seasons were longer term,â€ù Mr. Manson  said. â€œPeople want to own out there, but thereâ€™s very little that is brand new.â€ù,When the pop artist Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey, his manager and film collaborator, bought a 20-acre estate on the ocean in Montauk in 1971 for $225,000, they thought it was a good investment. Thatâ€™s what Mr. Morrissey said last September when the remaining 5.6 acres was on the market for $40 million.,Perhaps that overestimated price how good an investment it was. Earlier this month, Millard  S. Drexler, chief executive of the clothing company J. Crew, bought the estate for much less: $27 million, according to Paul Brennan of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who handled the sale.,(The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts donated the other 15 acres to the Nature Conservancy after the artistâ€™s death in 1987. The conservancy created the Andy Warhol Preserve in 1993.),The sold property, called Eothen, ancient Greek for â€œat first light,â€ù sits in a valley among high cliffs in an area known as the Montauk moorlands. Mr. Morrissey listed it with several different real estate firms over the last five years, originally asking $50 million.,Eothen includes a compound of five Colonial Revival-style houses, a horse stable and a three-car garage. All of the houses have spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean.,Mr. Drexler scouted Eothen for a friend who was interested, Mr. Brennan said, but then bought it himself when the friend passed on it. â€œHe said, â€˜Itâ€™s like a painting,â€™ a very unique property,â€ù Mr. Brennan said.,The five homes, with 15 bedrooms in all, were built in 1931 for the Church family, descendants of a founder of the Church & Dwight Company, makers of Arm & Hammer baking soda. Seven of the bedrooms are in the main house, a rustic wood-paneled structure with blue shuttered windows and a great room with two fireplaces, exposed beams and a vaulted ceiling.,â€œI would say he has very good tasteâ€ù to buy the estate, said Tina Fredericks, the East Hampton broker who sold Mr. Morrissey and Warhol the estate in 1971. As for the price, $40 million â€œalways seemed rather high,â€ù Ms. Fredericks said.,A developer is renovating the 1929 Shepherdâ€™s Neck Inn, a 65-room Montauk hotel, and plans to convert it into a year-round â€œresort hotelâ€ù called SolÃ© East. (Sole is Italian for â€œsun,â€ù although the Italians donâ€™t use an accent mark for the noun.),The hotel will have 60 rooms on 2.5 landscaped acres when it opens in the spring, according to Tom Feeley, an owner of the development firm Wavestone Properties. Wavestone has also bought the Shepherdâ€™s Beach hotel nearby and an adjacent five acres of vacant land, where the zoning was recently changed to permit residential development.,Wavestone has built condominiums and rental buildings in Jersey City and Hoboken, N.J., but this is its first project on Long Island.,SolÃ© East will be one of two branded hotels, Mr. Feeley said. The first, called SolÃ© on the Ocean, is a condominium hotel in Sunny Isles, Fla., which offers owners hotel-like services, including a concierge and housekeeping, and the ability to rent out their units as hotel rooms.,The look and feel of the Montauk hotel will come from Stephane Dupoux, whose interior design firm has designed highly stylized bars, nightclubs and hotels, including Buddha Bar and Cielo in Manhattan and the Gansevoort Beach Club hotel in South Beach.,The new hotel, Mr. Feeley said, will have high-definition flat-screen televisions, whitewashed walls, restored hardwood floors, cedar platform beds and black slate tile bathrooms with a large window in the wall separating the shower from the hotel room.,For winter visitors, there will be a 2,000-square-foot wine cellar and the developer will update the wood-burning fireplaces in the restaurant and in the lobby, Mr. Feeley said.,The Shepherdâ€™s Neck Inn was originally called Montauk Arms. It was built by Carl Fisher, the developer who, with a partner, created Miami Beach from swampland in the 1920s.,After that success, Fisher tried to build a similar resort in Montauk. A devastating hurricane and the stock market crash of 1929 left Fisher financially ruined, but not before he had planned an entire community in Montauk for the wealthy and partially created some of it, including private homes, grand hotels, a yacht club, a school and office buildings.,The inn was to serve as apartments for the managers of his resorts in Montauk, according to a history provided by the Montauk Library. â€œWe feel a connection with Carl Fisherâ€™s original concept and his connection to both markets where we are opening, in Miami and Montauk,â€ù Mr. Feeley said.",VALERIE COTSALAS,"JAN. 28, 2007",Higher Price Tags in Montauk,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/realestate/28lizo.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HARTFORD,THE tan house with the welcoming front porch at 56 Risley Street on the North End looks a lot like the other new homes in this inner-city neighborhood. But because it was designed with energy savings in mind, its ownersâ€™ utilities bill will be about $1,100 less a year than their neighborsâ€™.,The builder, Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity, set out to create a healthier, cost- and energy-efficient residence and to dispel the belief that building â€œgreenâ€ù is only for the rich. From photovoltaic solar panels on the roof to engineered-wood joists, more efficient toilets and Energy Star-rated appliances, little has been overlooked in the effort to create a replicable, eco-friendly home.,â€œThis is probably the greenest house in Hartford County right now,â€ù said Adam Ney, president of AuctorVerno, a marketing firm in Bethany that promotes green construction and that helped Habitat identify environmentally friendly products and supplies. Each side of the duplex is 1,250 square feet, with three bedrooms and one and a half baths. Habitat and United Technologies, which sponsored the environmental upgrades, say they  hope that aspects of the home will be copied by other Habitat affiliates in the Northeast as they build homes for needy families.,â€œWhat weâ€™ve learned here, we are already duplicating nearby,â€ù said Shea Hagy, the construction supervisor, referring to 16 other Habitat homes going up in a two-block radius and four more in New Britain.,While Habitat follows standards for green design elsewhere in the country, it has not done so in the Northeast because of the harsher climate and a reluctance to deviate from standard practice, Mr. Hagy said. â€œItâ€™s easy to put up solar panels in San Diego, where itâ€™s sunny all the time,â€ù he said. â€œThereâ€™s less payback here, but it still makes a difference.â€ù,Solar energy will provide 40 percent of the homeâ€™s electricity, yielding a savings of about $360 a year, preliminary estimates show. Conservation should reduce water and gas bills by at least an additional $700, the developers predict. â€œThe energy savings is one more leg up for our families,â€ù said Julie Donahue, executive vice president of Hartford Area Habitat.,Sunlight Solar Energy, of Milford, the installer of the solar system, took advantage of a rebate program started in October 2004 by the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, which typically gives back 55 percent of the installation cost. To date, 100 homes have qualified. New homes account for some installations, but most are in existing homes, said Bryan Garcia, the fundâ€™s director of energy market initiatives. Interest in solar power is growing as electric rates skyrocket and fears of a fuel crisis loom, he said.,Upfront costs are often higher in eco-friendly construction; in this case, materials added about 15 percent. But Habitat anticipates that reduced electrical and water consumption, the solar panel  rebate, durability and longer product warranties will make the home more cost-efficient in the long term.,The â€œgreenâ€ù effort extends to framing, furnishing and landscaping. Using two-by-six studs spaced every 24 inches, instead of two-by-fours at 16-inch intervals,  created deeper cavities for insulation. Overall, Mr. Hagy said, wood use is reduced by about 30 percent.,Household products and appliances were evaluated for air quality and environmental impact, Mr. Hagy said. Linoleum won out over vinyl flooring and carpeting for the high-traffic first floor because it comes from renewable resources, is easy to maintain and emits fewer volatile organic compounds (V.O.C.s), which emit potentially harmful gases.  Low-V.O.C. paints were chosen, and on the second floor, low-V.O.C. carpet squares, rather than rolls of carpeting and padding, helped reduce construction waste. Water-saving measures include restricted-flow plumbing devices, a front-loading washing machine and rain barrels to capture water for gardening and car-washing.,In terms of eco-building, â€œweâ€™re only scratching the tip of the iceberg,â€ù Mr. Hagy said, â€œbut for us, itâ€™s a big step.â€ù",MARGARET FARLEY STEELE,"JAN. 28, 2007","Building â€˜Greenâ€™ a Luxury?

"Oakdale,Despite the less-than-scintillating title, â€œInventory Controlâ€ù brings to the Anthony Giordano Gallery at Dowling College an  appealing group of works by seven artists, most of whom exhibit frequently. Some viewers may even recognize individual works, for a few have made the rounds of group shows in and around New York City.,Judith Page, a Brooklyn-based artist and curator,  is behind this  exhibition, which invites us to think about the role of lists, records, databases, statistical charts and graphs  â€”  what you might call inventory  â€”  in our lives. The artworks she has chosen reflect  the process of making lists, reports or records, as well as the kinds of items and ideas listed in them.,As a subject for artworks, inventory is not new. As Ms. Page points out in the exhibition catalog, we might understand the first, prehistoric scribblings of animals, humans and spirits on cave  walls  as a â€œsystem of classification.â€ù  They are something like a symbolic inventory.,Inventories for religious, civic, scientific or other purposes continued to be given visual representation throughout history. Most obviously, the hieroglyphs  often found inside ancient Egyptian temples and tombs listed the  possessions that the deceased owned in their  time on earth or that they thought they would need to live comfortably in the afterlife.,A similarly detailed, itemized record  of things in their possession was made by some of the artists in this exhibition, among them Elise Engler, who during  1997 and 1998 produced a detailed visual inventory of everything she owned. It is an extraordinary list, not to mention an appealing artwork:  17 panels containing 13,127 minute color drawings of every imaginable household object.,Similarly, Susan Hamburger inventories her personal possessions in small, cropped paintings of different aspects of a  kitchen, while Dahlia Elsayed charts changing emotional states, making inventory-oriented topographical paintings that associate geographical locations with moods, thoughts and states of mind. Her work, â€œStart of the Pre-Seasonâ€ù (2005), was painted late last summer, at a time of pleasant anticipation of  the months ahead  â€”  the beginning  of the new art season, the return to school and the buildup to the football season.,Chris Bors collects and inventories imagery from the Internet, which he then uses to create image collages and videos about youth culture. â€œLeaving My Boots in the Mosh Pitâ€ù (2005) is a compilation of found imagery of youths dancing and fighting at rock concerts. Nearby is â€œSlayer...Slayer...Slayer...â€ù (2003), a video of the artist, face obscured, recounting in nauseatingly adolescent  detail an alcohol-  and LSD-fueled visit to a  concert by the metal band Slayer in upstate New York. Here the inventory is of a personal experience.,Other works are less stimulating,   like Josh Jordanâ€™s collection of 33 quick sketches of beautiful women seen on New Yorkâ€™s L train, or Jim Costanzoâ€™s virtual performance, in which he inventories his daily activities through written records, digital photographs and scanned receipts, which are posted online and printed out in daily update sheets for viewers.,Then there is Charley Friedmanâ€™s â€œCarpet Worldâ€ù (2006), a humongous globe made of detailed sections of colored carpet. Here the notion of inventory relates more to the materials used by the artist, though the work makes you think of  stores like Carpet World, with their endless range of  styles and colors.,Mr. Friedmanâ€™s fuzzy, cuddly carpet globe has a haunting, momentous presence, though it is not clear why. Is it a comment on changing country configurations?  (He has not fully delineated the newly independent, post-Soviet Union states in Central Asia, for example.) Or  is it a metaphor for the ultimate inventory,  life on earth?",BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO,"JAN. 28, 2007","Material Things, Cataloged",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/28liarts.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One of winterâ€™s luxuries is a sweet, seedless navel orange. But this month in California, where most of the nationâ€™s eating oranges are grown, navels met with a killing frost. Although West Coast citrus will be fleetingly available as the last survivors are shipped, orange eaters will have to look beyond the Golden State for their vitamin C.,â€œItâ€™s going to be tricky,â€ù said Richard Thorpe, the produce buyer for Whole Foods markets in New England. â€œRetailers will turn to Florida, and prices will go up across the board.â€ù Florida citrus, he added, is sometimes â€œa little rougherâ€ù in appearance than the unblemished fruit from California, something that consumers will have to get used to.,In addition to the usual juice oranges and grapefruit, Mr. Thorpe will be scouting red navels, honey tangerines, royal mandarins and Minneola tangelos (also sold as Honeybells). The brilliant orange Minneola, a hybrid of the Dancy tangerine and Duncan grapefruit, is particularly sweet, and an easy peeler for lunch boxes.,Mr. Thorpe is also shopping abroad. â€œMoroccan clementines this year are fantastic,â€ù he said. â€œTheyâ€™re cheaper than California clementines because theyâ€™re loaded on large ocean vessels, and bulk freight lowers our landed prices.â€ù,Oranges, no matter their country of origin, lend themselves to maceration, or soaking in their own sugared juice.  Red navels,  with their prom-pink flesh, make a particularly cheerful winter dessert. Using a sharp knife, peel the rind and membrane from the oranges; slice or section them, remove any seeds, toss with a heaping teaspoon of sugar per orange, and refrigerate for a few hours. (You can even  add juice from an extra orange or two.) Serve straight up, or with vanilla ice cream.",ALICE GABRIEL,"JAN. 28, 2007",Consider Your Citrus Options,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/28weqbite.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For four decades, John Hechinger ran a hardware and home supplies chain founded by his father in 1911. In 1978, as part of an expansion, he moved the corporate headquarters to suburban Washington, D.C. Soon after, he began  collecting art to humanize  the somewhat sterile building.   Believing in the relationship between the tools his company made and the work that artists produced, he hoped the art would inspire his workers.,Mr. Hechinger died in 2004, but the collection he established has continued to grow through  acquisitions overseen by International Arts & Artists, a Washington-based traveling exhibition service that was given control of the collection after his death.,Touring nationally since 2001,  â€œTools as Art: The Hechinger Collectionâ€ù has touched down at the ,,  filling the museumâ€™s main exhibition galleries with 64 works by almost as many artists. It is surprisingly poetic, optimistic and intriguing.,Tools have a small but appreciable place in art history, mostly in the context of labor imagery. Prehistoric cave paintings in France and Spain have schematic diagrams of primitive implements, evidence of the first stirrings of human tool making, and scenes of peasants working the soil are found throughout ancient art. Farming returned as   a popular theme in art,  beginning with medieval paintings and prayer books, like the Book of Hours,  and continuing on through the 19th century.,But it was not really until the 20th century that tools became the subject of artworks. As Sarah Tanguy, curator of the Hechinger collection, points out in the exhibition catalog, depicting tools became for artists a â€œmeans to bridge the gap between art and life, and to address the shifting definition of perception.â€ù She is right, though it may also have had something to do with questioning the traditional artistic process as an act of creation, an act of making.,Art critics do not talk much about craftsmanship these days, preferring to dwell on ideas or the clever statements an artist seeks to convey. This is largely because of Marcel Duchamp, who was probably the first artist to make an artwork out of real tools. With his ready-mades, beginning in 1914-15, he claimed the right of anyone to become an artist by choosing an object and putting it in a gallery. Among his early ready-mades was a snow shovel.,Several artists in this exhibition share Duchampâ€™s anarchic values, like Arman, the late French artist who made sculptures using mass-produced tools like wrenches, handsaws, pliers and paintbrushes. (He is also known for his public-destruction artworks, like dynamiting a sports car.)  Shown here is â€œBlue, Red, Brownâ€ù (1988), something between a painting and a collage â€” thick stripes of paint end in paintbrushes, stuck to the canvas.,Similarly, Tracy Heneberger uses hardware-store materials like hinges to concoct adorably original, elegantly constructed sculptures, and the Chicago-based, self-taught artist known only as Mr. Imagination makes shadowy, masklike portraits using paintbrushes and found materials. There is something very African about the paintbrush portraits, though the artistâ€™s sources of inspiration include Christianity, world affairs, politics and popular culture.,In addition to paintbrushes and hammers, saw blades are popular, both as  subject and material for artists. Ken Butler and Donald Lipski employ saw blades in assemblage sculptures that tend toward minimalism. Several artists also use the blades as a painting surface, including Jacob J. Kass, Howard Finster, Lou Horner, Oleg Kudryashov, Rico Solinas, Wim Delvoye and John Schlesinger. Others make replicas of handsaws out of paper and wood.,Mr. Finster, who was born in Alabama in 1916 and died in 2001, was one of Americaâ€™s best-known folk artists. The exhibition catalog tells us that he experienced visions from an early age and was later to become a revivalist Baptist preacher. He â€œheard the callâ€ù to paint â€œsacred artâ€ù only in 1976, subsequently cranking out crudely evangelical paintings and sculptures, commonly linking words and images. Shown here is a painted Stanley handsaw from 1990, dealing with the history of tools.,There are also older, historical works of art, including a lush black-and-white photograph of a New York hardware store, a sign in the front window advertising a sale on tools. Berenice Abbott took the photograph in 1938 as part of a government-sponsored project to document the city and its inhabitants. It makes for a splendid period piece, the storeâ€™s owner having lined the window and pavement outside the store with all manner of items and implements.,If   Abbott sought to convey a wealth of detail about the subjects she documented, Walker Evans, her contemporary, was interested in economical, precise images that conveyed elegance, simplicity and restraint. So it is with â€œWrenchâ€ù (1955), part of a series of photographs titled â€œBeauties of the Common Toolâ€ù that was originally published in Fortune magazine. It is a chilly, no-fuss, front-on portrait, the tool stripped and reduced to its bare essentials.,Evans introduced this series of photographs on the beauties of the common tool to readers of Fortune with a brief essay, in which he stated what Mr. Hechinger seemed to know all along:  â€œAlmost all basic small tools stand, aesthetically speaking, for elegance, candor and purity.â€ù",BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO,"JAN. 28, 2007",Looking in the Toolbox and Seeing Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/28wearts.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SQUIRRELS are cute enough when they are providing acrobatic entertainment swiping seeds from your bird feeder. But they can also be equally determined at getting into your house.,â€œSquirrels arenâ€™t just mean â€” theyâ€™re vicious,â€ù said Thomas Barnes, an extension professor of forestry at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.,Squirrels will rarely enter a house at ground level; they almost always go in at the roof line. In finished attics, they will nest in the walls or ceilings, where they sometimes hold noisy acorn-rolling tournaments. In unfinished attics, they will often nest between the attic floor and the ceiling of the room below.,Dr. Barnes said that while holes or gaps around the roof provide easy access for a squirrel that prefers your warm house to the scant comfort of a hollow tree, easy access hardly matters. â€œHeck, they can chew through hardware cloth and chicken wire,â€ù he said. â€œVinylâ€™s not even a challenge.â€ù,Squirrels typically breed at the end of winter, and that can create additional problems if they have nested indoors. â€œYou canâ€™t remove mama and leave the babies there,â€ù Dr. Barnes said. â€œAnd you donâ€™t want to mess with the nest while the mother is around. Iâ€™ve seen people whoâ€™ve had the tip of their finger taken off.â€ù,While squirrels will gnaw beams, tear out insulation and transport nuts, fleas and ticks into a house,  the most serious threat they pose is chewing on electrical wires, which could cause a fire.,James Dreisacker, the owner of Westchester Wildlife Control in ,, N.Y., says his squirrel strategy depends upon the circumstances. Since squirrels leave the house in search of food during the day, he often uses single-catch traps that fit right over whatever hole the squirrels are using.,When a squirrel family is involved, he will set out one or more â€œmulti-catchâ€ù traps on the roof. The most enticing squirrel bait, Mr. Dreisacker said, is store-bought peanuts.,Bob Meakin, the president of the , Wildlife Management Association, a trade group in Syracuse, said that since it was illegal to release captured squirrels on public or private land without permission, most experts euthanize any animals  they capture, which is legal. (Homeowners can do the same.),Chuck Kaczyk, the owner of Animal and Wildlife Control in Saddlebrook, N.J., holds the patent on a device that provides one-way access to squirrels, and that one way is out.,â€œThe One-Way Door is a cylindrical tube with a flapper valve that the squirrel can crawl through,â€ù Mr. Kaczyk said. â€œItâ€™s kind of like a check valve on a sewer line.â€ù,The One-Way Door is affixed to the opening the squirrels are using, and once a squirrel goes out, it canâ€™t get back in.,After all the squirrels have left, all potential entry points must be sealed tightly with plywood, heavy-gauge aluminum flashing or steel mesh. The cost to eliminate a family of squirrels from an average house starts at about $300, Mr. Kaczyk said.,The common gray or black squirrels are not the only nuisances. Douglas Stern, the owner of the Stern Environmental Group, a pest-control company in Secaucus, N.J., said, â€œWeâ€™re seeing more problems with flying squirrels,â€ù a smaller cousin that has a flap of skin between its front and back legs that allows it to glide long distances.,The problem, Mr. Stern said, is that flying squirrels, which are nocturnal, act more like mice than squirrels. As a result, pest-control people often use poisons to eliminate them. And that, he said, is illegal because rodenticides are not labeled for use on squirrels.,The best way to get rid of flying squirrels, Mr. Stern said, is to use  chipmunk traps baited with peanut butter. â€œEliminating flying squirrels can take a while,â€ù he said, â€œbecause youâ€™re basically catching them one at a time.â€ù",JAY ROMANO,"JAN. 28, 2007",Giving Squirrels the Heave-Ho,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/realestate/28home.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DOUGLAS PINTER, a San Francisco real estate developer and the former chief executive of a long-forgotten Internet start-up, is used to the ups and downs of the business world, but his introduction to the pitfalls of , real estate has been a bit abrupt.,Just last month, Mr. Pinter closed on his $2.4 million 10th-floor apartment in a notable new condominium, the Urban Glass House, the last residential commission of Philip Johnson, modeled loosely on the architectâ€™s own home in , and marketed as a â€œmodernist luxury residence.â€ù,Mr. Pinter liked the buildingâ€™s light and airy look, even though its location, at Spring and Washington Streets, was in a grungy no-name land between Greenwich Village, TriBeCa and SoHo. It is across the street from ventilation shafts for the Holland Tunnel. Still, some upper-floor apartments have views to the south, and most of the apartments have views of the river to the north and west. At least for now.,But  in the last month, with most of the 40 apartments in the building sold or in contract, the New York City Sanitation Department said that it planned to take over a large parking lot just to the north and diagonally opposite the Urban Glass House. It would put up a garage as tall as a 15-story building and longer than a football field that promises to block much of the view of the river from many apartments.,Having a view blocked by a newer, bigger building is an old story in New York. But seldom has the view from such a distinctive building been threatened so soon after the ink on so many sales contracts has dried. The building opened in October.,Since then, Mr. Pinter and his neighbors, an affluent mix of models, minor celebrities and Wall Street executives who spent $2  million or more for their apartments, have been gathering information and organizing.,Mr. Pinter, who calls himself semiretired, said he was looking for â€œlike-minded residentsâ€ù to join him at a hearing called by the Sanitation Department to discuss plans for the new garage.,â€œItâ€™s a shame,â€ù Mr. Pinter said. â€œInvariably something would have been built there, but here is a building that was critically acclaimed architecturally, modest in size and scale and not gaudy, facing a consolidated sanitation garage.â€ù,The Sanitation Department plan was put forth in a 46-page document posted on the departmentâ€™s Web site. The document was dated Dec. 28 but was first spotted in early January by residents of the neighborhood. The plans call for putting up a garage 140 to 150 feet high on the lot, which is bounded by Spring, Washington and West Streets and to the north by a large office and warehouse building.   The Urban Glass House tops out at 137 feet.,The garageâ€™s ground floor would be used by the United Parcel Service, which now parks its trucks on the lot, while the rest of the building would be used by the Sanitation Department, consolidating three garages. A smaller garage just to the south of the parking lot and next to the ventilation shafts would be turned into a truck wash and refueling depot, storing 13,000 gallons of fuel and oil.,Vito Turso, a deputy sanitation commissioner, said that the garage was needed to replace garages along the river in the newly established Hudson River Park. â€œWe are trying to be as understanding and as good a neighbor as we can to that community,â€ù Mr. Turso said, â€œrecognizing that we still need to provide refuse collection, recycling and snow removal to that part of town.â€ù,Abe Shnay, a partner in the group that developed the Urban Glass House, said that buyers were still signing contracts and that most were aware that the parking lot could someday be developed. At one point, he said, there were rumors that a high-rise would go up on the site. â€œThe reality is that on the upper floors the best views are to the south, incredible views of the upper harbor and the Statue of Liberty,â€ù he said.,But Michael Shvo, the president of Shvo Marketing, a real estate company that is not involved with the Urban Glass House, said he always tells buyers,  â€œThere are only two views in New York that are guaranteed: if you are on a park, or if you are facing a brick wall.â€ù,CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING, the director of engineering at Googleâ€™s rapidly expanding New York office, knows how to find needles in what he calls a â€œ20 terabyte haystack.â€ù,Mr. Nevill-Manning, who invented Googleâ€™s Froogle shopping service, has now also threaded the real estate needle and landed one of downtownâ€™s most unusual and, for a while, hardest-to-sell properties: the rooftop English castle topped by a live-in copper dome at 150 Nassau Street, an ornate turn-of-the-last-century building that was once New Yorkâ€™s tallest skyscraper.,Mr. Nevill-Manning and his wife, Kristin, who also works at Googleâ€™s New York office, have just closed on one of the most expensive condominiums in the financial district, paying $6.45 million for the penthouse, which has 6,400 square feet of space spread over three floors atop a Romanesque and Renaissance Revival building, according to brokers briefed on the transaction.,The apartment has a 30-by-30-foot outdoor deck,  a private terrace that winds around the steep copper-clad roof, huge semicircular windows, 18-foot ceilings and a 360-degree view â€”  at least until the developer Forest City builds a 75-story skyscraper on the site of a parking lot for New York Downtown Hospital nearby. It has one major drawback, however: the space has no plumbing or electricity or interior walls, and it needs work estimated to cost $2 million or more, depending on the detail, before anyone can move in.,But if you want to know one version of what it might look like, you might look at the Spike Lee film â€œInside Man,â€ù released last year and starring Denzel Washington. The space was dressed up and appeared as the office of Jodie Fosterâ€™s character, a mysterious power broker.,The apartment was the last unsold unit in the 23-story building, a city landmark, built in 1895 as the American Tract Society Building. It happened to go on the market just days before the attack on the World Trade Center in September 2001.,Over the last few years, the apartment was offered through some of the largest brokerages in the city, Prudential Douglas Elliman and Brown Harris Stevens. It was finally sold by Adam Modlin and Reuben Davis of the Modlin Group, a small firm. Along the way, the asking price went from $12 million, including a $2 million credit toward the cost of the interior, to $6.9 million.,HOW much is celebrity really worth? Only two years after the actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her husband, Chris Martin, the British rocker, paid $7.95 million for a 7,000-square-foot condominium in TriBeCa, they have put it back on the market for an even $14 million.,The apartment on Harrison Street has 1,600 square feet of gardens and outdoor space, including a rooftop soaking pool, an elevator, a steam shower, six bedrooms and four and half baths. It also has  a finished basement with two washers and two dryers.,The listing broker, Carter Wilcox of the Corcoran Group, did not return telephone calls. But Stephen Huvane, Ms. Paltrowâ€™s publicist, said â€œconsiderableâ€ù work had been done on the unit. â€œI really doubt there is such a thing as â€˜celebrityâ€™ value at that price range,â€ù he said. â€œBut I am not a real estate professional.â€ù",,"JAN. 28, 2007",Few Views Are Forever,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/realestate/28deal1.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WHEN it comes to affairs of the heart, Robert Romanoâ€™s newest romance is proving to be his most expensive. The object of his affection â€” his wife, Regina, describes it as an obsession â€” is the coupleâ€™s 1920s colonial style home,  a house where , lived and painted many memorable covers for The Saturday Evening Post.,In all, the artist lived here for 23 years, 13 of them on Lord Kitchener Road in the north end, in a tidy colonial with white shingles and a slate roof. It cost Mr. and Mrs. Romano $1.6 million to buy and $500,000 to restore, so far â€” and their work has just begun.,Special homes and intense feelings often go together, according to Bruce MacDonald, an architectural preservationist from Tarrytown, who said Mr. Romano is not alone in falling in love with a house.,Even when a structure is not serving as a museum or listed on a historic register, owners are sometimes moved to honor its original design or history, Mr. MacDonald said. His firm, Ashwood Restoration, is overseeing the rehabilitation of the Jay mansion in Rye, a Greek Revival house built in the 1850s by Peter Augustus Jay, the son of John Jay, the first chief justice of the United States Supreme Court.,â€œThe Rockwell house is a notable building, and just because it doesnâ€™t have a landmark designation now doesnâ€™t mean it wonâ€™t someday,â€ù said Mr. MacDonald, who has been hired by Mr. and Mrs. Romano as a consultant for the section of the house that was the artistâ€™s studio.,Obtaining landmark status, however, often entails returning parts of a building to their original state. And although the new owners are intent on faithfully restoring sections of the Rockwell home, they have not yet decided how much to do and whether to apply for such a designation.,For the Romanos, longtime New Rochelle residents, the story of their relationship to this Rockwell home  â€” during his lifetime, the artist also lived in Vermont and Massachusetts  â€” began two years ago.,To gain more space for entertaining, the couple, who have two children â€” a daughter, Tessa, 19, who is a college student, and a son, Andrew, 25, who lives at home â€” had drawn up plans to expand their previous home. â€œWe had been working for six months with an architect,â€ù said Mr. Romano, 55, a corporate lawyer in ,. â€œBut then one Sunday afternoon we saw this house, and we couldnâ€™t resist it because it had had so much light and so much history.â€ù,They knew the property had belonged to Rockwell â€” Tessa had once done a school project about him â€” and they liked his work. But it was the details of the house itself that initially won them over.,The 5,300-square-foot two-story home, which has four bedrooms and four and a half baths, is in an established neighborhood of older Tudors and colonials, where houses have recently sold for $869,000 to around $2 million, according to Kathleen McAteer, the manager of Century 21 Wolff in New Rochelle.,â€œWe moved here in November 2005,â€ù Mr. Romano said, pointing around the artistâ€™s studio, â€œand as you can see, weâ€™ve been in some form of renovation and reconstruction ever since. Everything in this house has turned out to be a big project.â€ù,The costly slate roof on the house had to be replaced, and the aluminum siding (which the couple considered out of character with the residence of a painter of homespun American scenes) was torn away, revealing the original, but rotting, shingles, which also had to be replaced.,Window frames around the house were in various states of decay. And in the artistâ€™s studio,  a sill underneath the largest window, which allowed the north light to flow in, was rotting.,â€œMy contractor kept saying, â€˜Tear the place down!â€™ â€ù Mr. Romano said. â€œHe said it would be cheaper and less trouble. And maybe heâ€™s right, but thatâ€™s not what weâ€™re doing.â€ù,Mr. Romano has spent many hours researching the history of the house, and he and his wife say they plan to continue restoring whatever they can afford to do.,Explaining why owners sometimes lose their heads over a house, Audra Brecher, a preservation specialist for Stephen Tilly Architect in Dobbs Ferry, said: â€œOften, people are captivated by living in a famous personâ€™s home. Our buildings tell us stories, and people have romantic notions about the past.â€ù,Researching the architecture of southern Westchester during the early part of the 20th century, Mr. and Mrs. Romano unearthed a 1926 article in Good Housekeeping magazine about their house. From the text and photos, Mr. Romano was able to design new garage doors that matched the originals.,To replace the rotting sill in the studio, the large window above it had to be broken, but the Romanos replaced it with a window that looks the same, although the new glass is insulated.,In the main part of the house, the large brass lock on the front door had long been broken, workable only from the inside. The hardware was repaired and the brass restored by Accurate Lock in Stamford, Conn.,Leaving as much in place as possible in the studio â€” including the large brick hearth and the wagon wheel chandelier  â€”  Mr. and Mrs. Romano will turn Mr. Rockwellâ€™s former quarters into a media room.,Aside from all the high-minded reasons for buying this house, Mr. Romano admits to another consideration: sitting unplugged in his living room is a four-piece set of high-powered cherry-wood Bowers & Wilkins speakers designed to be used in home media centers.,As Mrs. Romano remembers it: â€œFor 15 years, I wanted to move to a bigger home, and my husband always resisted. Then, when he bought the speakers, which were too loud for our old house, I told him we had to either move to a larger place or get rid of them.â€ù,Someday, when all of the work is completed in the studio, Mr. Romano said, he will finally plug in the speakers, pull down a screen, sink into a comfortable chair and experience some of his favorite films in their full glory.",ELSA BRENNER,"JAN. 28, 2007",Falling in Love With a House and Its History,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/realestate/28wczo.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GREENBELT, Md.,THE old section of this city in Prince Georgeâ€™s County, built by the federal government for affordable housing during the Depression, is not a gated community. Yet the way Phillip Payette describes it, it might as well be.,â€œI donâ€™t have to leave too much,â€ù said Mr. Payette, a self-employed illustrator who works from his home, a 1937 brick town house with a slate roof. â€œBut I donâ€™t like to go too far anyway.â€ù,A glance at his surroundings may explain this homebody tendency. From his door, an oak-lined path curves past a row of well-kept attached homes, to a small commercial center where he can shop, see movies or swim. Nearby, farmland, reached past parks and ponds, offers dirt roads for rides on  his mountain bike.,Even though Capitol Hill is 12 miles away, and the city border of Washington even closer, here it is leafy, walkable and clean, evoking the European-style â€œgarden cityâ€ù that it was built to resemble.,Yet, as much as old Greenbelters praise their neighborhood, they criticize the very un-Greenbelt way their city has allowed the haphazard development of some of its land.,Shopping centers like the Beltway Plaza Mall have replaced tobacco farms and forests, and the roads that lead to them, like Kenilworth Avenue, are frequently clogged with traffic. So is Interstate 495, the Beltway, which roars nearby.,To make matters worse, crime is also a problem. With about 22,000 residents, Greenbelt had 158 reported robberies and 247 stolen cars in 2006. Most of those incidents, police records show, took place at Springhill Lake, a 2,900-unit building that is among the East Coastâ€™s largest apartment complexes.,Now, in a city where us-versus-them tensions already run high, old Greenbelters are bracing for a wave of newcomers, courtesy of two developments, whose combined total will almost double the number of homes in the city.,For the first project, a $750 million plan from the Apartment Investment Management Corporation calls for tearing down Springhill Lake, a 157-acre property that the developer already owns, and replacing it with 5,800 homes and 10,000 square feet of commercial space. Around 35 percent of the units will be owner-occupied and the rest will be rentals, according to the developer.,The second, Greenbelt Station, is a $2 billion proposal from Metroland Development for 2,200 homes and 2.7 million square feet of commercial space across a 130-acre lot that is now mainly a gravel pit and parking lots. The development will also abut a train station that serves lines of Washingtonâ€™s Metro and MARC, Marylandâ€™s commuter train.,â€œYou can live, work and shop there,â€ù said Walter H. Petrie, the chairman of Petrie Ross Ventures, which is a partner in Metroland Development. â€œWeâ€™re basically building a new town.â€ù,To do so, Mr. Petrie and his architects said they studied old Greenbelt. Its collection of homes and shops, separated with bands of greenery, has design elements in common with a modern â€œlifestyle center,â€ù with its open-air commercial districts, central squares and small parks. Mr. Petrie is currently building four other lifestyle centers in Maryland, he said.,Greenbelt Station will also emphasize pedestrians over cars, featuring wide sidewalks lined with benches and plantings.,That developers found inspiration so close to their work site is a coincidence not lost on planners. â€œOne of the best examples in the country of a walkable development is right across the street,â€ù said Chad Williams, the planner coordinator for Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which must approve both development proposals. â€œItâ€™s cyclical how the older ideas rise again.â€ù,In both projects, lighting will play a major role. While the glare canâ€™t be too harsh, developers said, it also must be bright and direct enough to deter criminals. This is of particular concern in Springhill Lake. Lighting choices will be weighed seriously so the new complex doesnâ€™t have as many shadowy, trouble-prone corners as the current one, said Patti Shwayder, a senior vice president for the Apartment Investment Management Corporation.,â€œThe security of our buildings is very important to us,â€ù she said.,In comparison to its neighbors, old Greenbelt, with 1,800 units, is small. About half of the units along its fishhook-shaped plot of land are owned by a co-op, which bought them from the federal government in the early 1950s. Recent listings put their prices at $210,000 to $315,000 for two-story homes with 1,000 square feet.,In addition, for a fee of about a $400 a month, maintenance workers will empty trash cans, trim hedges and patch roofs.,Scattered among them are rentals, built in the 1960s, and single-family homes that went up in the 1990s.,Despite the effect that thousands of new residents could have on their neighborhood, old Greenbelters generally support the two new projects.,For its part, Greenbelt Station will contribute ball fields, a community center and a pool to the city (promises that resulted from an eight-year battle, including a lawsuit).,And if Springhill Lakeâ€™s crime-prevention tactics pay off, residents say, it will be an improvement on the original.,â€œItâ€™s better to have owner-occupied units than the rentals, which attract more transients,â€ù said Sylvia Lewis, the co-opâ€™s president, who has lived in the same two-bedroom house since 1968. â€œIt will be better.â€ù,To hedge her bets, though, this fall, Ms. Lewis started the Greenbelt Community Foundation, which will provide grants of $500 to $2,500 for local not-for-profit groups working to improve the city, in line with old Greenbeltâ€™s utopian values, she said,â€œOur ideals are very fragile,â€ù Ms. Lewis said, â€œand they have to be strengthened with every new generation.â€ù,Greenbelt isnâ€™t the only Roosevelt-era planned neighborhood facing development pressure. Greenhills, Ohio, which was also built in 1937, faces perhaps a more severe threat.,In the last few years, developers in Greenhills have torn down 20 of the neighborhoodâ€™s original 700 homes to make way for larger ones, said Deborah Mills, president of the Greenhills Historical Society, which opposes the teardowns. Unlike the homes in Greenbelt, those in Greenhills are owned by the town, which can decide their fate.,â€œTheyâ€™ve torn down the International style homes and replaced them with ones that would fit on the South Carolina shore,â€ù Ms. Mills said.,In some ways, controversy has followed these â€œgreenâ€ù enclaves since Rexford Guy Tugwell, head of President Rooseveltâ€™s Resettlement Administration, dreamed them up as a way to offer families state-of-the-art rental housing, close to major cities, where unemployed adults might find work. (Greenhills is outside Cincinnati, while Greendale, a third such community, is a suburb of Milwaukee.),Ardent free-market capitalists criticized the governmentâ€™s involvement in the real estate business. The $10 million price to build Greenbelt was also called expensive.,Local Maryland farmers even worried that the workers for the project would steal their apples, according to Jill St. John, curator of the Greenbelt Museum.,Michael Sorkin, a New York-based architect who grew up in Washington, has included elements of garden cities like Greenbelt in his work for cities in the United States and abroad.,For him, the New Urbanist trend, which favors highly compact developments that resemble urban downtowns, owes a debt to neighborhoods like Greenbelt, which efficiently uses its space, he said.,â€œThe urban crisis of the moment is sprawl,â€ù he said, â€œSo Iâ€™m glad that the idea of the garden city has not yet run its course.â€ù",C.

"RELOCATING from San Francisco, Andrew Wagner and Heather Bradley Wagner had few requirements for their new New York home.,They wanted a one-bedroom apartment within walking distance of Mr. Wagnerâ€™s office in SoHo that had â€œenough space to let us coexist in our second year of marriage,â€ù Mrs. Wagner said.,â€œThere werenâ€™t a lot of deal breakers at the outset,â€ù she said. â€œThe one thing we didnâ€™t want was a high-rise with no character. We were looking for a place that had interesting history and wasnâ€™t generic.â€ù,Mr. Wagner, 33, a founding editor of Dwell magazine, was relocating to take a job as editor in chief of American Craft, charged with reviving that 60-year-old magazine. Mrs. Wagner, 30, a freelance writer, contributes to the magazine Domino.,The two, who are native Californians, met through friends and married a year ago. She joined him in his two-bedroom, $1,200-a-month rental in Pacific Heights.,Mrs. Wagner was visiting New York in the fall for a relativeâ€™s birthday celebration. So she extended her trip to hunt for a home â€” an endeavor that, at that point, both thought would be enjoyable and exciting.,Though Mrs. Wagnerâ€™s sister, Pamela Bradley, lives on the Upper East Side, Mrs. Wagner stayed primarily with her sisterâ€™s boyfriend, Jack Jarowicz. He lives in Peter Cooper Village, which was much closer to the areas where she was hunting. And, unlike her sister, he had Internet access at home.,With Mr. Wagnerâ€™s new position, their budget allowed for $2,800 a month â€” or $3,000 at the very most. Compared with San Francisco, â€œwe were going to be at the upper end; we were kind of high-rolling,â€ù he said.,In Lower ,, however, it proved to be an awkward amount. One-bedrooms in that price range existed, but â€œeach place I looked at, I didnâ€™t want to stay a minute more than was polite,â€ù Mrs. Wagner said.,â€œI was uncomfortable being in the spaces, which seemed to portend bad things to come,â€ù she said.,Through friends, she heard of a $2,700 vacancy in Chelsea. â€œIt was sort of subterranean,â€ù with a sorry-looking backyard â€œwalled in by buildings and dead plants,â€ù Mrs. Wagner said. The backyard didnâ€™t compensate for the small size. â€œWe canâ€™t live in a backyard!â€ù she exclaimed.,Inside a Second Avenue place, she saw a â€œfrighteningly rickety loft-bed structure.â€ù Outside a SoHo building, she was asked for spare change and offered drugs.,In the East Village, she got the â€œhard sell like I have never experienced in my life.â€ù The apartment was filled with sawdust and construction workers. Only when she asked to see it again did she learn there were not, as she had been told, a dozen eager applicants. â€œThat was an eye opener,â€ù she said, the creation of fictional demand to rope you in.,â€œI think Iâ€™m pretty resilient, but the hunt beat me down,â€ù she said. â€œI was feeling pretty hopeless.â€ù,Her husband, wrapping up his work at Dwell, tried to calm her over the phone. â€œAs the days went on, I heard her voice change from enthusiastic to tearful, tearful, tearful,â€ù he said. â€œHeather gets mad at me to this day. I have no concept of how terrible it was other than vicariously.â€ù,They decided to take the first nice place she saw: a quaint one-bedroom, renting for $2,700 in a co-op building on a tree-lined West Village street. The 450-square-foot apartment had little closet space, but came with basement storage.,The coupleâ€™s sublease agreement was contingent upon approval of the co-op board. â€œThe broker kept saying, â€˜Iâ€™m sure you can do a phone interview; you are going to be fine,â€™ â€ù Mr. Wagner said. When they were told they had to meet the board in person after all, they scheduled a date to do so and booked a moving company.,Then came â€œthe most frustrating call Iâ€™ve ever received,â€ù Mrs. Wagner said. They had to fly out a week earlier to meet the board. They dropped everything to book a one-day trip.,With the emergence of so many glitches, they started to fear they would be rejected, â€œbut we had no other choice because thatâ€™s where we had put all our eggs,â€ù Mr. Wagner said. If need be, the movers could haul their stuff to a storage facility in ,.,They anxiously searched Craigslist, the Web site, for a backup place and found an unusual listing: a 900-square-foot TriBeCa one-bedroom, with 14-foot ceilings, for $2,800 a month. The landlords, a married couple, replied quickly to their e-mail message. They often rented to artists and architects, like themselves, and kept the rent low so they had a good choice of tenants.,The Wagners arranged to see the apartment during their one day in New York. It was â€œrough around the edges,â€ù Mr. Wagner said, but had character galore. The centerpiece was a big white cube, originally a darkroom, with a sleeping area on top. The landlord had designed it himself three decades ago, when he bought the building, which may have once been a textile warehouse.,The Wagners even knew one of the unitâ€™s previous occupants â€” Matthew Baird, an architect. â€œI love that cube,â€ù Mr. Baird said, calling it â€œa great â€™70s omnibus space dividerâ€ù with a â€œminimalist spirit.â€ù,The Wagners were offered a lease, though they felt bound to keep their appointment at the West Village apartment, which Mr. Wagner had not yet seen.,When they asked to see the storage space at that apartment, they were told it contained the ownerâ€™s stuff and wasnâ€™t available. That was the final indignity. They said â€œthanks but no thanksâ€ù to the board members, who â€œwere so nice it was like having tea at your grandmotherâ€™s house,â€ù Mrs. Wagner said.,They rushed back to the TriBeCa building, signed the lease and called the movers, who were at their San Francisco place, packing.,The West Village broker later complained that they willfully defaulted on the lease, but took no action against them. â€œNo one said it was our apartment until we said we didnâ€™t want it,â€ù Mr. Wagner said. â€œIf it was our apartment, we never would have flown out here on a momentâ€™s notice and dropped $1,000 to come out here for just one day.â€ù,Their new apartment, big enough to fit much of their furniture and artwork, feels both expansive and homey. Inside the cube is a small office and closet, where they plan to add a guest bed.,â€œI feel kind of a rube because I am so obsessed with the story of this place,â€ù Mr. Wagner said, â€œand now I realize every place in New York has a story like this.â€ù",,"JAN. 28, 2007","Finding a Cube, Feeling Like a â€˜Rubeâ€™",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/realestate/28hunt.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IT was shortly after he appeared on the television show â€œQueer Eye for the Straight Guyâ€ù that Jeff Berman decided he couldnâ€™t continue sharing an apartment near Battery Park with four roommates.,He still liked his roommates, but suddenly, he didnâ€™t trust them with his furniture. The apartmentâ€™s fraternity house atmosphere, he said, hadnâ€™t worried him â€œwhen we had a couch that cost $140, which we had split five ways.â€ù,But now that â€œQueer Eyeâ€ù had furnished the place with stylish pieces from Desiron in SoHo, Mr. Berman started feeling protective. â€œIt is really nice stuff,â€ù he said, pointing to a zebra-wood desk and a dining room set that could be on the cover of House & Garden. â€œI felt like the nagging mother,â€ù he said.,So he was happy when a friend, Lauren Reece, asked him to share her 1,400-square-foot loft on Lower Broadway.,Ms. Reece, an owner of Billyâ€™s Bakery, a 1950â€™s-style Chelsea institution, had also been on â€œQueer Eye,â€ù not as a contestant, but as a dessert maven. At the time, she was Billy Reece and had not yet begun the transition from man to woman.,For  Mr. Berman, a young  lawyer who  had met Ms. Reece  â€” then Billy â€” at a bar in Chelsea two years before,  moving in with a transsexual required a leap of faith. He was worried that a host of changes, physical as well as psychological, would make the perky  Ms. Reece â€œa bit unstable.â€ù,As it turns out, domestic tranquillity reigns. The two roommates could pass for a suburban couple: Mr. Berman, 26, in workout pants and a T-shirt, Ms. Reece, 28, in a pink cardigan and  pearl necklace.,Home from work, Mr. Berman drinks a beer while Ms. Reece, who is  perfecting  her feminine figure, eyes a protein bar (not one of the cupcakes for which Billyâ€™s Bakery is famous).,Mr. Bermanâ€™s bedroom is enclosed, at one end of the loft; Ms. Reeceâ€™s is reached by a stairway and sits atop the bathroom and laundry room, at the other end. The space separating them, with 14-foot ceilings and large, south-facing windows, is filled with the â€œQueer Eyeâ€ù furniture.,â€œIt was a boondoggle,â€ù said Mr. Berman of his appearance on â€œQueer Eye.â€ù(He is gay; his episode was about making a gay man â€œgayer.â€ù),Ms. Reece, too, has received free furniture from a television show. In 2005, â€œLaw & Order: Criminal Intentâ€ù rented the loft for two days of shooting and in the process built a large storage unit, which the producers were glad to leave behind. These days, the shelves hold part of Ms. Reeceâ€™s collection of  jadeite dishes, mostly from the 1940â€™s.,Against another wall is a large collection of American cookbooks, including a rare second edition of  â€œJoy of Cooking.â€ù Cookbooks â€œtrace social history,â€ù Ms. Reece said, reflecting every change in society, from the Depression, to shortages in wartime, to new technologies.,She also has every issue of Everyday Food magazine, published by Martha Stewart, one of her idols. In fact, she appeared on Marthaâ€™s TV show last May; at the time, she was introduced as Billy, though with long hair and a somewhat feminine appearance as a result of hormone treatments.,â€œMartha was cool, but some of the stagehands were a little surprised,â€ù said Ms. Reece, who added that more recently, she had been rejected by TV shows after explaining that Billy no longer exists.,All of which intrigues the mild-mannered Mr. Berman, who came to New York in 2002 from Philadelphia to attend Columbia Law School. Before that, as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, he said, he was completely closeted, but by 2002 he was ready to explore life as a gay man in ,.,During law school, he first lived in student housing near Grantâ€™s Tomb, then moved with several of his classmates to the apartment downtown. In the process of coming out, he began blogging about his experiences. A producer at â€œQueer Eyeâ€ù read his blog, which mentioned the four straight roommates, and recognized a hook for an unusual episode.,It begins with the â€œQueer Eyeâ€ù cast  â€”  the Fab Five â€” meeting Mr. Berman and his roommates and trying to figure out which one is gay. (They didnâ€™t pick Mr. Berman.),At the time, the apartment had no discernible style, and Mr. Berman was flabbergasted when, in just four days,  Thom Filicia and his team transformed it into a trendy bachelorsâ€™ pad. (He also received thousands of dollarsâ€™ worth of clothes, including a white dinner jacket, and cooking lessons at the French Culinary Institute.),In the meantime, Billy Reece had some good luck of his own. After working at the Magnolia Bakery, an impossibly popular spot in the West Village, he left to start Billyâ€™s with two partners. The business was a success almost from the day it opened in December 2003. Also in 2003, a friend, Tad Beck, invited him to share the loft.,In the late 1990â€™s, the owner of the building, which houses several theater companies as well as residential tenants, went bankrupt; the banks that took over the building tried to evict the tenants, Mr. Beck said. The tenants hired lawyers and ultimately won a settlement allowing them to stay in the building for life at rents far below market. Mr. Beck, the actual leaseholder, pays about $2,200 a month and is subject to only tiny annual increases.,He and Ms. Reece were roommates until Mr. Beck decided to attend art school in California. Thatâ€™s when Ms. Reece asked Mr. Berman to move in, which involved bringing his â€œQueer Eyeâ€ù  furniture, now intermingled with Ms. Reeceâ€™s midcentury kitchen appliances and her giant armoire by Martha Stewart for Bernhardt.,But the armoire will be going; Ms. Reece plans to leave New York later this year. Her partners in Billyâ€™s Bakery are buying her out, and she plans to move to the Midwest, not far from where her mother lives. Her family, she said, has been â€œamazingly supportiveâ€ù of her sex change.,That will leave Mr. Berman as Mr. Beckâ€™s only subtenant, which he says will be a welcome respite after years of roommates. Not that the place is quiet. The jeans store right downstairs plays â€œthumpa thumpa musicâ€ù too loud, he said, and you can hear it through the floorboards until the store closes at 7 p.m.,But Mr. Berman rarely leaves his  office at Debevoise & Plimpton in Midtown before 7,  and otherwise the place is spacious, light and, by New York standards, a steal.,And it only took litigation, a reality series, a roommateâ€™s sex change and two peopleâ€™s out-of-state  moves for him to get it.",FRED A.

"LOVE the neighborhood, hate the house. That is a common enough complaint from both current homeowners and prospective homeowners.,Lenders have an increasingly attractive alternative for people in this situation: renovation loans. With these, a borrower who wants to move into an existing home need not compromise on quality, and the homeowner who has outgrown the house but does not want (or cannot afford) to move can upgrade more economically.,â€œWeâ€™re seeing a huge increase in demand for these, and weâ€™re foreseeing another record year in 2007,â€ù said John Sway, a vice president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.,Mr. Sway said that because house values are growing more slowly, or slumping, in many markets, homeowners cannot simply wait a year and use the increased equity to upgrade their houses. â€œThey need to rely on the future value of the home to make improvements,â€ù he said.,Renovation loans cover the costs of the upgrades, but the total loan amounts are based on the predicted value of the house after the work has been completed.,For example, a family with a three-bedroom house worth $400,000 and a mortgage of $300,000 may want to spend $65,000 to renovate and pay for the new loanâ€™s closing costs.,For renovation loans, lenders require borrowers to submit architectural drawings of the proposed renovations, and these are used to estimate the homeâ€™s future value.,If the lender appraises the future value of the house at $500,000, the new loan will be for $400,000 (since the owners already had $100,000 in equity in the home). Assuming they had a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6 percent,  monthly payments before the renovation loan were $1,798.,Interest rates on renovation loans run slightly higher than those on 30-year fixed mortgages, to reflect the slightly higher risk that banks take when lending money on what amounts to a partly completed house. Assuming, then, a 6.75 percent interest rate on 30-year fixed renovation loan of $400,000, the owners would pay $2,594 for the new loan (and for the â€œnewâ€ù house). The borrowers  should also expect an eventual property tax increase.,Mr. Sway says renovation loans have been popular in the New York area, particularly among buyers who do not want to move into outdated homes.,Wells Fargo, for one, offers three types of renovation loans. The most popular is for an amount of $417,000 or less on single-family properties, for which the typical down payment is 5 percent.,Bruce Hirschfeld, the president of Montvale Mortgage, a mortgage brokerage in Montvale, N.J., said the local market for renovation refinance loans had also been steady. â€œAlthough prices arenâ€™t rising the way they were, weâ€™re still not to the point where someone can go from a three-bedroom house to a five-bedroom house as easily as they could by just doing the work themselves,â€ù he said.,Lenders, Mr. Hirschfeld said, usually break up payments into six stages during construction and require borrowers to demonstrate completion of the previous stage before they issue a check for the next.,One attractive element of such loans, Mr. Hirschfeld said, is that lenders fold the first six months of interest into the overall loan amount, freeing borrowers from payments during the construction period.,The lack of a mortgage payment  helps. â€œThen, you just have to deal with the construction,â€ù Mr. Hirschfeld  said, â€œand figuring out whether or not you can live in hell for six months.â€ù",,"JAN. 28, 2007",Hate the House?

"Some blocks of Manhattan give the impression that, say, Italian food is everywhere. Then there are pockets like the small Japanese restaurant scene around Second and Third Avenues in the 40s, a short walk from the United Nations for visitors, immigrants and anyone else craving sushi, noodles, grilled meat and fish.,Aburiya Kinnosukeâ€™s tables are usually filled with Japanese businessmen with banquets of food in front of them and broad smiles on their faces.,The menu is divided into many parts, including house-made tofu, salads, sashimi, and rice and noodle dishes. But grilling occupies center stage. Under the heading â€œShichirin Grill,â€ù the restaurant serves meat and fish that diners can grill over bincho-tan charcoal, which produces little smoke.,Riingo is a warren of sleek red and black rooms, each more enticing than the last. The menu is a synthesis of many cuisines, emphasizing Japanese.,The conventional sushi, like yellowtail and fluke, is excellent, but it is impossible to pass up selections like tuna foie gras, smoked char and rice-puff-crusted shrimp.,This restaurant, hidden away in the basement of a Midtown office building, lures enthusiasts to its subterranean locale with its expansive sake list of more than 200 bottles. The sprawling multipage menu offers cleanly executed dishes meant to accompany the sake, including standards like boiled edamame, and the filling rice balls called onigiri that you would expect at any izakaya, or Japanese pub.,The mood is quiet, contemplative, austere. But Sushi Yasuda has a lot of downtown in its soul. The exemplary service is open and friendly.,At the same time, the menu is dead serious, a puristâ€™s paradise of multiple choices among fish species â€” nearly 40, a startling number for a small restaurant â€” and elegantly presented appetizers and side dishes.,The first time you make a reservation at Tsukushi â€” and reservations are all but necessary to ensure youâ€™ll get a table or a berth at the bar â€” the woman on the other end of the line will let you know that thereâ€™s no menu, that everything is omakase, chefâ€™s choice.

"SOME might find living in the Times Square area unimaginable. The traffic is often at a standstill, the sidewalks are often impassable and the lights are on â€” and blinking â€” 24/7.,To Charles Kipps, however, it is absolute paradise. A writer of novels and film and television scripts, Mr. Kipps moved last June into a two-bedroom, two-bath condominium at 1600 Broadway, the only residential building in that gleaming swath of the Great White Way between West 42nd and West 53rd  Streets. He thrives on the pace and the bustle, and wonders why he spent 16 years renting in the relative calm of 48th Street and Eighth Avenue, across the street from a busy firehouse.,â€œItâ€™s exciting, and every night except one, the place is buzzing with activity,â€ù said Mr. Kipps, a Virginia native, whose credits include segments of â€œLaw and Order: Criminal Intent.â€ù He pointed out, â€œNothing says New York like a great row of neon lights.â€ù,What may say it even more  is the dropping of the ball on New Yearâ€™s Eve, which Otis Davis, a neighbor of Mr. Kipps, watched from the terrace of his penthouse, along with the estimated million people gathered on the sidewalks outside. The parties inside the building were even more fun than the party below. â€œEverybody was home, everybody had their doors open and every single person had a party,â€ù said Mr. Davis, a court stenographer, who moved from a house on ,. â€œYou could just walk from party to party.â€ù,Completed last summer, the 25-story condo at 1600 Broadway is the latest arrival on a growing residential scene in the theater district, which is roughly bordered by 41st Street on the south, Eighth Avenue on the west, West 53rd Street on the north, and the blocks between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas on the east, but not including the office buildings that line Avenue of the Americas.,On the border of Hellâ€™s Kitchen (also known as Clinton), Eighth Avenue is gaining the most new buildings, almost all luxury high-rises. In addition to rentals like the Biltmore, the Ritz Plaza, the Gershwin and Longacre House, there are the 215-unit Link and the 654-unit Worldwide Plaza. Brokers are marketing the 60-story, 550-unit Orion as part of the theater district,  though it is near the Port Authority Bus Terminal and outside the theater zoning district designated by the city.,Future projects, all to be completed from 2008 to 2010, include the Platinum, a 43-story, 220-unit tower being built by SJP Residential Properties, at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 46th Street. There are also a 40-story, 120-unit condo at 785 Eighth Avenue being built by Esplanade Capital; a 46-story, 271-unit tower on West 46th Street and Eighth Avenue built by Tribeach Holdings; and a 34-story, 400-unit rental being built by the Witkoff Group on 43rd Street, with 20 percent put aside for low- and moderate-income families. The Related Companies has bought a parking facility on Eighth Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets but has not finalized development plans, a company representative said.,On side streets between Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue, many four- and five-story walk-ups contain rental units.,Many longtime residents have been connected with the theater, but new arrivals buying into the luxury towers are a mix: young professionals working for financial companies in Times Square like Morgan Stanley or Lehman Brothers, and out-of-towners wanting pieds-Ã -terre, as well as people in entertainment. There are few families. But both newcomers and longtimers seem to choose the neighborhood for its easy connections to city and suburbs.,â€œItâ€™s extremely convenient for someone like me who has to go to ,, Long Island and ,,â€ù said George Stilo, an interior designer who moved to the Ritz Plaza from , 13 years ago. â€œYou have access to the subway, the L.I.R.R., Port Authority and the bus to the airport.â€ù,According to Mr. Stilo, who also loves the restaurants, the only drawback to living in the area is the noise level. â€œThere are people who have moved out of my building who couldnâ€™t take the noise,â€ù he said. â€œIt can be very, very noisy, and that would be my only reservation.â€ù,Uzma Akhand, a Columbia University doctoral student who lives at the Ritz Plaza, got used to the noise. â€œMy parents live in Connecticut,â€ù she said, â€œand when I visit them, I canâ€™t sleep because itâ€™s too quiet.â€ù,At 1600 Broadway, condominium prices range from $795,000, for a studio that measures about 600 square feet, to $1.845 million, for a 1,325-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath unit with space for a home office. The 900-square-foot penthouse, with one bedroom, one bath, a home office space and a balcony, is listed at $1.375 million.,The Link, on West 52nd Street, has two apartments available, each with two bedrooms and two and a half baths. One on the 19th floor is listed at $1.745 million; a slightly larger one on the 41st floor lists for $2.3 million. The buildingâ€™s amenities include a fitness center.,The Orion Condominium has four one-bedroom apartments available, at prices of $715,000 to $735,000. The building has a gym, three exterior decks, pool and hot tub, and offers a free Starbucks breakfast to residents every day, said Jason Karadus, a vice president for the Corcoran Group.,Rentals run the gamut from old-style four- and five-story walk-ups on side streets to all-rental high-rises on and around Eighth Avenue, like the 53-story, 464-unit Biltmore or the 44-story, 479-unit Ritz Plaza, which was one of the first residential towers in the area when it opened in 1990. According to Marc Kaplan, director of leasing at the Ritz Plaza, there is a studio available for $2,650 a month. He also mentioned two renovated one-bedroom, one-bath units, for $3,395 and $3,495.,Extensive rental listings at , Apartments include a studio in a walk-up for $1,650 a month and a two-bedroom in a doorman building for $6,695, said Adjina Dekidjiev, rental operations manager.,According to the Encyclopedia of ,, the Times Square area has been the theater district since just before World War I, when music, drama, cabaret, dance halls and the like moved uptown from the Bowery and Lower Broadway.,Once the preserve of families like the Vanderbilts and the Astors, Times Square proper was known as Long Acre Square until the turn of the last century, when the name was changed to commemorate the opening of the new New York Times headquarters in the square.,It was The Timesâ€™s publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, who staged the first New Yearâ€™s Eve extravaganza. The area started to decline after the stock-market crash in 1929, when burlesque shows, penny arcades and the pornography business started crowding out the legitimate theater. Erotic entertainment became increasingly popular during World War II with the influx of servicemen on leave. The industry was largely forced out in the early 1990s.,Pearl Caruso and her husband, Stephen, who works in the financial industry, have front-row seats at 1600 Broadway for the Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade and annual New Yearâ€™s festivities in Times Square, but it was the theater scene that brought the couple to the neighborhood. â€œWe go to the theater once or twice a week now,â€ù said Mrs. Caruso, a special education teacher who also volunteers for Broadway Cares, an AIDS charity. She wants her daughter, Laurel, 2, exposed to the theater in the hopes that she will one day perform on Broadway. Mrs. Caruso has scouted out childrenâ€™s programs at Carnegie Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Alvin Ailey and â€”  her favorite â€”  the School for Strings.,Duffy Square, newly refurbished, will reopen this spring, and with it the Theater Development Fundâ€™s TKTS booth, the discount theater ticket sales center, relocated to the Marriott Marquis hotel during refurbishment. The area, called â€œthe bowtieâ€ù because of the criss-cross intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, will undergo a $10 million renovation over the next few years, said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance business improvement district.,Chain restaurants like Red Lobster and Applebeeâ€™s dot the main arteries, but there are many more intimate places on Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Retailing on Broadway is dominated by tourist spots like the M&M emporium, and chains like Sephora cosmetics. There is a supermarket, a Food Emporium, on Eighth Avenue; the Times Square Alliance is seeking more resident-oriented retailing.,There is one school in the theater district, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School on West 46th Street, but David Diamond, chairman of Community Board 5, said more may be added as the neighborhood evolves. â€œCommunity Board 5 probably has the fewest schools of any board because we are the central business district,â€ù he said.,The high school teaches Grades 9 through 12. Students in 2005 averaged 399 on the SAT verbal section, versus 497 statewide, and 404 on the math, versus 511 statewide.,For middle schoolers, there is the Clinton School for Writers and Artists on West 21st Street in Chelsea. Of eighth graders in 2005, 67.6 percent scored at or above grade level in math, compared with 40.8 percent citywide, while 63.9 percent scored at or above grade level in English, compared with 32.9 percent citywide.,Public School 212 on West 48th Street teaches kindergarten through Grade 5. Of fourth graders in 2005, 88.5 percent performed at or above grade level in English, compared with 60.4 percent citywide, while 92.4 percent did so in math, compared with 78.3 percent citywide.,Times Square is Manhattanâ€™s major hub for subway connections and buses out of the city from the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street. Subways stopping at Times Square include the 1, 2, 3, 7, N, Q, R, S and W trains. Local buses include the M42, M104, M27 and M50 cross-town lines, which connect to lines going north on Sixth and Eighth Avenues and south on Broadway and Seventh Avenue.,Itâ€™s busy, bright and bustles constantly. For theater buffs and night owls, no neighborhood offers more in the way of performing arts, bars and restaurants of all descriptions.,Luxury residential towers mark the final phase in the gentrification of what for most of a century was one of the cityâ€™s grittiest, flashiest areas.",,"JAN. 28, 2007",Those Neon Lights?

"LONG ago, in that dark, clamorous age before the â€™90s really got under way â€” sometime after Wham! dropped off radio playlists, but before Vanilla Ice had evaporated â€” most people did not have e-mail or cellphones, and there were no such things as Match.com, instant messaging, text messaging, BlackBerry or MySpace. Back then, men and women had to actually meet in person, or phone each other, if they wanted to talk. But scientific advances have brought remarkable progress to the dating game, right? Not necessarily.,In â€œThe Joy of Text: Mating, Dating and Techno-Relating,â€ù the foxy young relationship pundit Kristina Grish (the author of â€œBoy Vey!â€ù â€” tips for non-Jewish women who hope to snare Jewish boyfriends â€” among other advice guides) shows that the great leap forward in communication has dragged along with it a blight of text-driven power games and misunderstandings.,For instance, when a woman abruptly logs off an I.M. exchange, does she mean it to sting or to tantalize? How long do you wait to respond to an e-mail message (up to three days is not insulting, Ms. Grish believes) and text messages (more than a few hours is probably a brushoff)?,Also, she cautions, be careful how you word your techno flirtation: misspellings can be cute, or can make you look like a moron, while quirky punctuation can make you seem unstable. If you use too many exclamation points in your BlackBerry messages, youâ€™ll look slap-happy. If you use ALL CAPS, your iChats can resemble death threats. â€œLike it or not, you are what you type,â€ù Ms. Grish declares. Shrewdly and wittily, she points the way on alphanumeric dating.,Her recommendations are often strikingly specific. An especially useful one: What should you do when a cyber-Cyrano sends you long, eloquent missives, but never asks you out? Pull a few words from his e-mail message that could be â€œeasily misconstruedâ€ù and tease him with them. Ms. Grish instructs: â€œYour only response is one sentence: â€˜Iâ€™m sorry, but you just used the words â€œhot,â€ù â€œpursuingâ€ù and â€œstrappedâ€ù in that last e-mail and Iâ€™m still recovering. ... Is there something you wanted to ask me?â€™ â€ù,But be careful of the passions you whip up, she warns, and remember that once you hit â€œsend,â€ù you cannot prevent your correspondent from hitting â€œforward,â€ù or worse, posting your steamy prose on his blog, where it can be salivated over â€œby strangers with a bucket of popcorn.â€ù,LIKE Ms. Grish, the relationship counselor Terrence Real recognizes that the last decades have seen a revolution in the dealings between men and women that has flummoxed both sexes. â€œFor most of us, whatever we learned growing up about relationships is simply not sophisticated enough to deliver all that we hope for,â€ù he writes.,He adds consolingly, â€œYou have been trying to negotiate a 21st-century relationship using 20th-century skills.â€ù In â€œThe New Rules of Marriage,â€ù he provides a set of â€œoperating instructionsâ€ù for modern couples, illustrated by compassionately told case studies of embattled clients he has led away from the brink of divorce.,Mr. Real isnâ€™t afraid to make breathtakingly bold statements. â€œIn the last generation women have radically changed, and men, by and large, have not,â€ù he writes. As a result, â€œMen are not all that unhappy in their marriages. They are unhappy that their women are so unhappy with them.â€ù  Women, on the other hand, â€œwant radical transformation.â€ù They want their marriages to be â€œintimateâ€ù (new paradigm), not â€œcompanionableâ€ù (old paradigm).,If this in fact is what women want (sounds about right to me), many of them have an awfully strange way of going about it, as Mr. Realâ€™s true-life stories show.,Venting, criticizing, blaming and complaining â€” all in the name of â€œhonest expressionâ€ù â€” too many women provoke resentment, not sympathy, in their mates, he explains.  The men respond by giving in to their worst impulses, like withdrawal, bullying, arrogance or stonewalling, hoping to ride out the storm.,How can we all get along? By replacing accusation with understanding, Mr. Real suggests, and continually posing the question: â€œWhat can I give you to help you give me what I want?â€ù,Mr. Real blames psychotherapy, in part, for the communication impasse: too many Americans, he believes, have been encouraged to seek â€œpersonal empowermentâ€ù rather than â€œrelationship empowerment,â€ù putting themselves first, and not trying hard enough to appreciate their partnerâ€™s good points.,He identifies five major pitfalls that trip up the over-empowered individual: Unbridled Self-Expression, Needing to Be Right, Controlling Our Partner, Retaliation, and Withdrawal. And he provides exercises so couples can assess their own flaws (no, donâ€™t surprise your partner by showing him your bullet-pointed list of , failings), and strategies to increase â€œcherishing.â€ù,Mr. Real knows that readers may feel overwhelmed by his unsparing solutions to tough-love woes. He writes, â€œA part of you may be wondering, â€˜Has the game of love really grown so technical that I need an intimacy coach just to have a decent relationship?â€™ â€ù In a word: Yes.

Warner IV loved explosions, cartoons, army uniforms, pranks involving frogs and ice cream â€” he called health food â€œseeds and twigs.â€ù,Mr. Warner, the son of Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Catherine Conover, the daughter of the philanthropist Paul Mellon, also loved wearing kilts  because of his Scottish heritage.,Although his parents divorced when he was young, they lived next door to each other in Washington. He was known to ride his motorized minibike there  as fast as it would go, sometimes with Senator Warnerâ€™s second wife, the actress Elizabeth Taylor, as a very vocal passenger.,After Mr. Warner graduated from the University of Virginia, where his fraternity, Chi Phi,  voted him â€œhellmasterâ€ù four years in a row, he became a professional race car driver, naturally. â€œItâ€™s a blood sport,â€ù said Mr. Warner, now 44. â€œItâ€™s a thrill going around the track 6 inches from the wall at 180 miles per hour, but itâ€™s frightening. You grow up very quickly.â€ù,His father said, â€œHe wanted his own identity and he found it.â€ù,In 1998, Mr. Warner moved to Westport, Conn., living alone in a big old  house that was decorated with 18th-century furniture and always filled with friends, usually playing pool in the dining room. â€œJohn is all-inclusive,â€ù Tommy Walker, an old friend, said of his parties. â€œHe invites not only the people heâ€™s close to, but also the guys doing the gardening at his house.â€ù,Mr. Warner created Americanstock.us, a Web site offering Nascar and stock car racing history and collectibles. He also began making documentaries  like â€œThe Wendell Scott Story,â€ù  about the first black  driver  to reach the top level of stock-car racing.,Through it all he remained a die-hard and distinctive bachelor, sometimes picking dates up in his 1936 Packard or his 1966 Aston Martin. But he grew to dislike breaking hearts as much as he hated eating tofu. â€œJohnny never wants to let anyone down,â€ù said Jill Mullen, a friend.,He also became disillusioned, always questioning the motives of the women he dated. By the time he was in his early 40s,  he had broken two engagements and pretty much given up hope.  â€œA lot of women in New York and L.A. are in it for the dollar, not for a healthy relationship,â€ù he said wearily.,Then, in November 2004, Jodi Edmonds, another old friend of Mr. Warnerâ€™s, set him up on a blind date with Shannon Ford Hamm, a first-grade teacher at the Spence School in New York, who had taught her two daughters. Mr. Warner, who still loves frogs and other slimy creatures, suggested that they meet  by the reptiles at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. â€œHe had such a wide-eyed view of the worldâ€ù Ms. Hamm said. â€œIt was wonderful to meet someone like that, especially at our age.â€ù,He, on the other hand, was unsure about Ms. Hamm, whose family founded the Hammâ€™s Brewing Company, which was based in Minnesota. She was nothing like the wild supermodels and party girls he had been dating. Ms. Hamm has unflashy clothes, jewelry and ways and is the opposite of high-maintenance.,She is never one to speak first or loudest, and though beautiful, seems to deflect attention. Her parents, Jean Hamm of Wayzata, Minn., and Edward Hamm of Jupiter Island, in Florida, describe her as a solid Midwestern girl who doesnâ€™t need flattery.   But, underneath her  cool demeanor, friends say she has a wicked sense of humor.,Nevertheless, he wasnâ€™t interested in a second date with her.,Then, one year later, tired of young, temperamental beauties, he called. Ms. Hamm wasnâ€™t miffed and agreed to see him. â€œI feel strongly that you never want to close any doors,â€ù she said. â€œYou never know.â€ù,This time, they went to the Guggenheim, and then to  lunch, then to a party and a late dinner. â€œWe had such a great time,â€ù Ms. Hamm, now 41, said of their 12-hour date.  â€œWe just had to wait until the first kiss to see how that went.â€ù,Mr. Warner was surprised he had much in common with a schoolteacher. Like him, she collected antiques and had a come-one-come-all attitude about parties. And, he said, â€œher family grew up with wealth, and theyâ€™re eccentric and funky and I feel totally at home. She gets it when I tell her all the weird things about my family, and I get it with her family.â€ù,He recalled  falling in love with her when he visited her classroom at  Spence.  â€œSheâ€™s just beautiful with children,â€ù he said, adding that she seemed so guileless and good-hearted, especially in comparison to him. â€œI never thought sheâ€™d like a bad boy like me.â€ù,Soon after they started dating, friends noticed a change in Mr. Warner. He put his pool table up for sale, and started shopping for dining room furniture, now that he had someone to dine with regularly. â€œHe used to watch all these war movies, ,of war movies,â€ù said Ramon Ruiz, another friend. â€œThen, one day he said, â€˜Change it to the antiques channel.â€™ Thatâ€™s when I knew it was serious.â€ù,For the first time in his life, Mr. Warner said he felt unconflicted about getting married, and last May, six months after their 12-hour date, he proposed in Paris. â€œThereâ€™s an old adage that you wait for the right one,â€ù Senator Warner said. â€œAnd if ever there was a case of a man waiting, it was John.â€ù,The couple wed on Jan. 13 in Jupiter Island, where the brideâ€™s family has a vacation home  with a sign on the front door that reads: â€ùFriends Welcome. Relatives by Appointment Only.â€ù  It is an immaculate place with  homes that are pastel-colored, like Mentos, and as low profile as its residents seek to be.,The coupleâ€™s Episcopal ceremony took place at the beach-cottage-like Christ Memorial Chapel of Hobe Sound, where the Rev. David Prior, its chaplain, officiated with  the Rev. William Billow, senior chaplain at St. Albans School in Washington,  which the bridegroom attended.,After the service, the couple and their 170 guests followed a sandy path lined with hurricane lamps down to a white tent set up on the beach. Inside, the tent looked like a chic new Manhattan hotel lobby. It was decorated with seashell-white couches, carpeting, chandeliers, candles and  flowers.,The bridegroom, whose back still hurt from a recent motorcycle crash, greeted guests Ã  la Truman Capote, while lounging (in a kilt) on one of the couches. The bride, meanwhile, looked completely natural in her sleeveless gown and her hair pulled back as if for tennis.,â€œThese two people are just so meant for each other,â€ù observed Bernard Rogers, a guest. â€œShe is enormously patient, and heâ€™s enormously impatient and it really goes together.â€ù",,"JAN. 28, 2007",Shannon Hamm and John Warner IV,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/fashion/weddings/28vows.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"THEY pour into your e-mail in-box, as explicit as they are relentless, with subject lines too shameful to share with colleagues. Enlarge your penis! Shrink your waistline! Enhance your sex life! Delete, delete, delete.,But they reappear, as relentless as they are explicit, with pop-up pictures embarrassing for the boss to see. Enlarge your penis! Shrink your waistline! Enhance your sex life! All before lunch.,The spewing of spam over the digital transom has long been derided as an annoyance and provoked concerns about the insecurity of computer networks. But now some e-mailers and experts on psychology and technology worry that it is also having a more pernicious effect: insecurity for the recipient.,With worldwide volumes having doubled in the past year, and ever-more sophisticated spammers singling out computer users with particular interests or problems, it can serve as a constant reminder of what is lacking for those with fragile egos â€” whether a sinuous body or an eight-cylinder sex drive.,â€œHow do they know I need to (fill in the blank)?â€ù the recipient wonders.,Delete, delete, delete.,â€œIt can affect your emotions and your level of stress,â€ù said Jeffrey T. Parsons, a psychology professor at Hunter College, who has conducted research on sexuality and the Internet. â€œOnce you get in a spam loop, you can get bombarded with these things four or five times a day, and that can definitely trigger insecurities and exacerbate ones that already exist.â€ù,Pam Fitzgerald, managing partner of a marketing company in Virginia who struggles with her weight, bristles at the diet-plan spam, wondering â€œwho knows how much I weigh.â€ù And her heart aches for one of her young employees, the only one in the small firm not to have finished college, who seems to be a magnet for spam pushing Johnny-come-lately bachelorâ€™s degree programs. â€œItâ€™s rubbing him raw day in and day out,â€ù she said. Worsening the psychic toll is the increasingly focused tailoring of spam of all stripes.,Legitimate retailers buy contact lists of e-mail addresses, while underground computer hacks trade â€” or steal â€” them. Spammers often steal e-mail addresses from topic-oriented and corporate Web sites with scores of registered users, and also corral highjacked networks of personal computers called botnets to glean specific information from other computersâ€™ hard drives, like e-mail address books.,So junk e-mail arrives looking as if it came from a personal friend, or it will seem sympathetic to the receiverâ€™s lifestyle, with advertisements for Christian mortgages popping up in the in-boxes of computer users active in Christian organizations.,Howard Steinberg, a diabetic and the head of a Westport, Conn., company specializing in diabetes education, is a lightning rod for diabetes-related spam â€” most of it offering quack remedies for a disease he considers deadly serious.,â€œThey are absolutely using social engineering techniques,â€ù said Daniel Druker, executive vice president for marketing at Postini, a communications company in San Carlos, Calif., that provides anti-spam services and processes about 1 billion e-mail messages a day. â€œAnything they can do to break down your natural resistance.â€ù,Though 99 percent of spam is still sent randomly, Mr. Druker said that tailored spam is increasing and that we will only see more of it. â€œI would predict that in 2007, the bad guys will be targeting their attacks even more.â€ù,All of which only enhances a computer userâ€™s fear that somehow he keeps getting a certain solicitation for penis-enlargement because someone, somewhere, thinks he is lacking.,â€œWhether itâ€™s overweight or sexual topics, for those who have challenges there can be low self-esteem,â€ù said Joshua Fogel, an assistant professor of behavioral sciences at Brooklyn College. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of psychological baggage with being overweight. Likewise for a man who is having trouble sexually. The spam reminds them of their vulnerabilities and will make them feel even more inadequate.â€ù,Though e-mail ads for weight-loss and sexual performance products have been around for years, they are still among the most common forms of spam. And if you are struggling with a personal issue and happen to be easily suggestible, such spam can be uncomfortably personal.,â€œIt feels like a real invasion of privacy,â€ù said Ms. Fitzgerald, the Virginia marketing executive wary of weight-loss spam. â€œYou do react emotionally to this stuff, thereâ€™s no doubt about it.â€ù,What are sensitive types to do? Professor Parsons recommends addressing the root of the problem. â€œSeek professional help for the underlying issue,â€ù he said, so that spam doesnâ€™t become â€œa trigger for more emotional distress.â€ù People with serious disorders, like sex addicts, should get a very strong filter that not only blocks access to pornographic Web sites, but filters out pornographic spam.,Unlike the sources of glossy catalogs and other pieces of bulk mail that pile up on kitchen tables, spamâ€™s origins are often illicit, the handiwork of offshore operators. Even for those who are at peace with their physique, having unseemly spam thrust into their face can be embarrassing, evoking a tawdry netherworld they would rather not know about.,â€œSome of the penis enlargement ones will have images, which gets you,â€ù said Carolyn Sevos, president of IntraCommunities, a technology company in Manhattan, referring to the thumbprint-size pictures that appear  at the bottom of her screen as she scrolls through e-mail even without opening it.,â€œYouâ€™re sifting through your e-mail â€” click, click, click â€” and then youâ€™ll see that and it makes you sit up in your seat,â€ù Ms. Sevos said.,Betty Maul, who owns a print and advertising company in Cherry Hill, N.J., said more than 115 junk e-mail messages had poured into her in-box one recent day by 5:15 p.m. There were cures for obesity and impotence, cheap pills from Canada, men in hot pants, stock tips, gambling opportunities and the cryptically worded â€œlove enhancements.â€ù,Absent, at least for the moment, was one of Ms. Maulâ€™s favorites: a come-on for breast enlargements. â€œIâ€™m already a very well-endowed woman, so that one frightens me,â€ù she said. â€œThatâ€™s become a joke in our office.

"Boston,LAST month, Betsy Gotbaum, New York Cityâ€™s public advocate,  issued a report noting  that Caesarean section rates at some of the major hospitals  in the city were nearly 40 percent, about 10 percentage points higher than the national average. The rates are probably even greater, given that the data â€” the most recent available â€” was from 2004 and the surgeryâ€™s popularity has only grown since then.,What gives? Have New York women been more susceptible to the Britney Spearsification of childbirth? That is: book an operating room reservation for delivery and then get a tummy tuck. Childbirth activists believe that the too-posh-to-push phenomenon, while tiny, may be part of the problem, especially in trend-conscious New York. But they say doctors are more to blame because they fear malpractice claims and want to control birth and their schedules as much as anyone, so they encourage women to have Caesareans that may not be necessary.,Obstetricians claim the rates are so high because professional women are becoming  pregnant later in life, often with technological help, which makes labor and delivery riskier.,However, these truths donâ€™t hold with all women. While New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia had the highest Caesarean rate, at 39.6 percent, the hospital  with the lowest, at 18.3 percent, was  North Central Bronx Hospital, according to Ms. Gotbaum.,Which brings us to another angle to consider.,In 1908, Franklin Newell, a doctor affiliated with Harvard Medical School, said that moneyed urban women suffered more when having a baby, and he wanted to prevent them from having â€œnervous breakdownsâ€ù by offering Caesareans. This was a radical concept at the time. Caesareans were truly dangerous then. Antibiotics had not yet been invented. Anesthesia was in its infancy. But Newell still thought the surgery would be best for the mother.,â€œIt seems to me that this overdevelopment of the nervous organization is responsible for the increased morbidity of pregnancy in the overcivilized class,â€ù Newell said. â€œThe advocacy of an elective Caesarean section for patients who have no pelvic obstruction will undoubtedly come as a shock to many members of the profession.â€ù,Indeed it was. At the time, Caesarean rates were about 1 percent. (The World Health Organization today states that Caesarean rates in industrialized nations should be between 10 percent  and 15 percent, beyond which, the risks and costs of the operation outweigh the benefits to mother and baby.),But back to Newell. I believe he was on to something. New York women, stereotypically some of the most empowered and health conscious in the country, should not have any trouble giving birth, even if they are 38 years old and pregnant for the first time. Strength, both mental and physical, is all it usually takes to give birth (along with a lot of encouragement).,Yet if â€œovercivilizedâ€ù is synonymous with â€œeducated,â€ù which could equal â€œhaving too much information,â€ù which could make anyone neurotic, then it could also be said that city women are overcivilized. Thinking too much about everything that could go wrong during birth, instead of focusing on how it is a natural physiological process, is a recipe for surgery.,All a New York obstetrician has to do is introduce the concept of danger or inconvenience, and the expectant mother gets the vapors. Even some midwives, the guardians of natural birth, have admitted to me that they can tell by looking at a pregnant womanâ€™s rÃ©sumÃ© whether she will be more prone to a Caesarean. Uptight? Check. M.B.A.? Check. Drives a Volvo? Check. If the cityâ€™s Caesarean trend keeps up, they can just skip to one simple question: From the Upper East Side? Check.,Although it is difficult to determine which belief came first, that upper-class women could not or would not handle childbirth or that doctors thought such delicate flowers could not or would not tolerate it, both, sadly, seem to be increasingly true today.,Although New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia serves a diverse population, it also has many high-risk and affluent patients, as well as private-practice doctors who may be financially motivated to perform the surgery. (Nationwide, uncomplicated Caesareans cost almost two times as much as  uncomplicated vaginal deliveries in the hospital.),By contrast, North Central Bronx, a public hospital  that serves a diverse population and doesnâ€™t have the financial incentive to perform Caesareans, has the lowest procedure rate.,Or perhaps, doctors there arenâ€™t inquiring about mothersâ€™ rÃ©sumÃ©s.",TINA CASSIDY,"JAN. 28, 2007",Cut and Run,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/nyregionopinions/28CIcassidy.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s recent declaration that food from cloned animals is safe was a fresh reminder of how poorly the biotech industry and its regulators have managed the fieldâ€™s portfolio of innovation over the years.,A recent , found that Americans overwhelmingly distrust government and industry to provide truthful information about biotechâ€™s risks and safety. Yet equally important as risk â€” and more often overlooked â€” are the publicâ€™s equally real and unaddressed concerns about who is looking out for its interests as the genes of plants, animals and microbes, as well as entire organisms, become privatized through the patenting system.,Stephen Hilgartner of Cornell University said he believed that the economic and political challenges surrounding these so-called life patents would come to rival those of biotech risk, and he has come up with a sensible framework for starting a new conversation about them.,From the moment the first biotech patents were granted in 1980, the industry was hailed as a new frontier â€” uncharted territory where a new generation of scientist-inventors could reap the traditional rewards of innovation.,But even as the gold rush began, critics as varied as scientists and human rights advocates declared that biotechâ€™s new intellectual property frontier was already occupied. Claims of novelty and innovation as the basis for life patents, they said, disregarded the realities of not only nature, but also of research practices, democratic decision-making and global governance.,These realities led Mr. Hilgartner, an associate professor in Cornellâ€™s science and technology studies department, to think about how society might deal with biotech discoveries outside the strict economic imperatives of intellectual property law.,The title of an intriguing paper he wrote on the subject, , is a wordplay on the well-known concept of â€œacceptable riskâ€ù â€” that is, the level of risk a society considers acceptable, given existing social, economic and cultural conditions.,In other words, what level of intellectual-property protection is society â€” not the biotech industry or its phalanx of patent lawyers â€” willing to accept in exchange for the benefits of biotechnology?,With this question in mind, Professor Hilgartner began to investigate whether legal theories of real property, rather than innovation, might be a more useful way to think about who owns biotech inventions and what can be done with them.,He notes that the law frames the ownership of property as a bundle of rights. People who â€œownâ€ù real estate actually own a set of expectations, relationships and obligations to various communities and regions.,Depending on the communitiesâ€™ rules, property owners may not be able to drill for oil, cut down trees or build new structures without permission, for example. They are obliged to prevent dangerous conditions, to pay for damages if they donâ€™t, and so forth. Communities are accountable in various ways to property owners as well.,In contrast, there is no analog to this network of obligations for a patent holder. As Tim Hubbard, a Human Genome Project researcher, noted at a 2001 conference: â€œIf you have a patent on a mousetrap, rivals can still make a better mousetrap. This isnâ€™t true in the case of genomics. If someone patents a gene, they have a real monopoly.â€ù,This monopoly gives patent holders total control over patented genetic materials for any use whatsoever â€” whether for basic research, a diagnostic test, as a test for the efficacy of a drug or the production of therapies.,Professor Hilgartner said patents donâ€™t just determine who will own new technologies and who has access to them. They also influence what technologies cost, whose cultural and ethical values they represent, and what aspects of the research and development process will be transparent â€” and to whom.,The degree of control that life patents grant their owners is of growing concern to scientists, human rights and patient advocates and ethicists. More than 20 percent of human genes have already been patented, and most of those patents are owned by corporations.,Professor Hilgartner noted how this kind of control can play out in the real world. In the case of the Canavan disease patent, for example, a family afflicted by this rare genetic disorder initiated an effort to find the gene mutation responsible for the disease. They raised money, collected DNA samples and attracted researchers to the cause.,After a researcher found the gene in the late 1990s, he and his employer, Miami Childrenâ€™s Hospital, patented it and began charging royalties on a genetic test to screen for the disease â€” despite the fact that they would never have found the gene without the efforts and the DNA samples of the afflicted.,Patient groups , in 2000, contending misappropriation of trade secrets by using their childrenâ€™s DNA without consent to obtain a patent. It took until 2003 for the parties to reach a confidential settlement; it allows certain laboratories to continue collecting royalties but lets institutions, doctors and scientists use the patented gene sequences without paying.,There are many other examples of life patents causing public concern. One of the most important examples involves patents on food crops and cloned animals. These patents have a growing potential to cede control of the worldâ€™s food supply to biotech patent holders.,Important questions must also be answered about who can legitimately â€œownâ€ù or control our personal genetic information. And no one has yet been able to address economic, social and legal questions raised by the patenting of genetic resources taken from developing countries.,This month, for example, Peruvian farmers protested against the biotech giant Syngenta, which genetically modified a common potato variety so that the potatoes are sterile unless a chemical is applied.,Risk concerns aside, farmers say they want to know why the company can charge a premium for adding a few new genes to a potato variety â€” yet they cannot, in turn, demand a royalty from Syngenta for using the â€œpropertyâ€ù that they and their ancestors have been â€œgenetically modifying,â€ù by traditional means, for centuries.,Biotech companies are also amassing huge patent portfolios by tapping the genetic diversity found in volcanoes, rain forests and deep sea hydrothermal vents. They collect DNA from micro-organisms they find, patent it, and sell access to the gene sequences to pharmaceutical, agricultural, chemical and industrial companies.,Only rarely do such companies voluntarily work with indigenous communities to come to mutually agreeable terms for these kinds of activities. There has been much international protest as a result, but very little concrete action to change the situation.,These concerns may sound like the nattering of nabobs to those who believe the present system of protecting intellectual property is acceptable. But like it or not, a large and powerful infrastructure has declared that patents are crucial for getting discoveries out of the lab and into the market, and it will not change on its own.,NEVERTHELESS, that does not change the larger reality that Professor Hilgartner describes: that decisions about intellectual property are about much more than simply finding ways to stimulate and reward innovation.,They directly affect what technologies make it to the marketplace. They determine who is accountable for biotech products and processes, under what circumstances, and how they affect everyone.,Shifting the terms of the debate from patents and innovation to the rights-based framework that Professor Hilgartner has proposed may not be an immediate solution. But it is certainly the most direct route to a more democratic and inclusive conversation about intellectual property concerns as biotech marches on.",DENISE CARUSO,"JAN. 28, 2007",Someone (Other Than You) May Own Your Genes,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/business/yourmoney/28reframe.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is easy to calculate the worst time to buy a house: usually, itâ€™s  exactly when you are looking for one.,If itâ€™s a buyerâ€™s market, then interest rates may be so high that you canâ€™t afford anything decent. But if interest rates and prices are nice and low,  then smarter, quicker buyers are sure to find the best deals.,That can be how it seems, anyway, when so much money is on the line. But a chart from the National Association of Realtors shows that some years are actually much easier on the bank account for the average home buyer, based on the convergence of  interest rates, median home price and median family income.,In these days of no money down, the chart somewhat quaintly (and prudently) assumes a 20 percent down payment and 25 percent of gross income going toward mortgage principal and interest. Given those assumptions, the early 1980s, when interest rates soared into the double digits, were the worst time to buy a home, while the early â€™70s were the halcyon days.",PHYLLIS KORKKI,"JAN. 28, 2007","Alas, the Best Time to Buy a House Was 35 Years Ago",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/business/yourmoney/28count.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"RUNNING a storied enterprise like ,â€” software heavyweight, geyser of cash, corporate icon â€” is about much more than energy and  commitment, says ,, the companyâ€™s chief executive. It is all but a calling, an article of faith.,â€œYouâ€™ve got to be very realistic about where you are, but very optimistic about where you can be,â€ù he said during interviews this month. â€œAnd the day you canâ€™t be both of those things, you shouldnâ€™t be a leader of a company like Microsoft. You have to believe; you have to believe; you have to believe.â€ù,In the Ballmerian world view, failure is not an option. â€œIf we donâ€™t get it right at first, weâ€™ll just keep coming and coming and coming and coming,â€ù he says.,For the better part of the last two decades, the prospect of Microsoft coming and coming and coming, relentlessly picking off and then dominating various sectors of the software business, has sent shivers through the ranks of its competitors. Many have fallen by the wayside or changed course to avoid being crushed by one of the most successful and viciously competitive companies of any era.,No longer.,Competitors once feared and respected Microsoft. Now they simply respect it. And as Microsoft prepares to unveil new versions of its desktop operating system and office programs on Tuesday  it finds itself facing emboldened competition, even uncertainty. With the Internet revolution upending business models across a broad swath of industries, Microsoft itself is feeling the heat. The challenges that the company confronts today are different from those of the past, and its market power in the personal computer business matters less than before.,More homes and offices are getting wired with high-speed Internet connections, a market-altering shift that is buttressed by a stream of advances in data storage, computer-processing and software. This second generation of Internet technology animates advertising-supported Web services like search, and opens the door to the delivery of online alternatives to Microsoftâ€™s popular desktop programs like e-mail, word processors and spreadsheets.,The consumer rollout this week of new models of Microsoftâ€™s mainstay products, Windows and Office, is one that many industry analysts view as the last hurrah of the fading order of computing, dominated by the PC and ruled by Microsoft., the search giant, is, of course, the leader of the Web 2.0 wave and may be the most potent competitor Microsoft has ever encountered. But Microsoft faces a variety of nimble, wily and innovative opponents in other markets as well. In video games, it goes up against , and ,; in music players, ,; in corporate software, ,, , and Linux.,Deciding how to respond to Microsoftâ€™s growing host of competitors has fallen to a bullet-domed,  hulking, boisterous whirlwind whose friendship with ,, Microsoftâ€™s founder and chairman, dates back to their college days and whose dexterity and acumen will determine Microsoftâ€™s fate. Mr. Gates declared last June that he plans to step out of day-to-day work at Microsoft entirely by the middle of next year to become a full-time philanthropist.,Mr. Gates says he is confident that he is leaving Microsoft in safe hands. In an e-mail message, he calls Mr. Ballmer â€œa great partner and a great friendâ€ù and describes his relationship with Mr. Ballmer as â€œone of the greatest business partnerships of all time.â€ù,Yet earlier victories may not help Microsoft much today.,â€œThe world has changed, and how Microsoft adapts to that change is going to be the test of Steve Ballmer,â€ù observed Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist and former senior Microsoft executive. â€œHe has fundamentally sound judgment, heâ€™s a great leader and heâ€™s capable of listening and hearing things that are not the way he wished. He has the tools.â€ù,Others who have worked with Mr. Ballmer over the years have no doubts about his intelligence,  persistence and underlying pragmatism. Even so, Microsoft, despite its deep pockets and immense resources â€” in fact, precisely because of those vast resources â€” has potentially much more to lose in the Internet age than other companies. â€œThis is every bit as disruptive for Microsoft as it is for others,â€ù said George F. Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research, the technology consulting firm. â€œThe dilemma for Microsoft is that it is a prisoner of its business model, and the fact that it is a gilt-lined prison makes it brutally hard to change.â€ù,One of the evolutionary laws of business is that success breeds failure; the tactics and habits of earlier triumphs so often leave companies â€” even the biggest, most profitable and most admired companies â€” unable to adapt.,Microsoft faces that quandary today. A huge promotional push will accompany the arrival of Microsoftâ€™s gold-mine offerings â€” Windows Vista and Office 2007 â€” because the desktop operating systems and office software businesses accounted for a majority of Microsoftâ€™s $44.28 billion in revenue last year and about 80 percent of its profit. Yet Windows Vista, repeatedly delayed and arriving two years late, comes as the center of gravity in computing shifts increasingly toward  the Internet.,The PC software business will not wither anytime soon, according to technology analysts and executives, but more and more of the excitement and significant new applications will gravitate to Internet-based software. Since Mr. Ballmerâ€™s first full year as chief executive in 2001, Microsoftâ€™s revenue has risen 75 percent and its operating profit 40 percent, but its stock price has been flat, reflecting Wall Streetâ€™s doubts about Microsoftâ€™s growth prospects.,Yet as Mr. Ballmer navigates this pivotal juncture in his companyâ€™s 31-year history, he remains a visceral optimist. (He often deploys a favorite Colin Powell quotation: â€œPersistent optimism is a force multiplier.â€ù) When asked about his biggest worry for Microsoftâ€™s future, he dismisses the notion of worry as â€œa funny term,â€ù as if it were an alien concept. Instead, he speaks of advertising-supported Internet software and services like Google and open-source software like the Linux operating system as â€œnew business models that we either have to compete with or embraceâ€ù â€” and thus rivals worthy of his attention and his â€œspare brain cycles.â€ù,Donâ€™t call it worry, but Mr. Ballmer acknowledges that Microsoftâ€™s toughest task has been in deciding where to place its bets in new markets or technologies that donâ€™t operate by the same rules as its tried-and-true products. â€œOne of the biggest mistakes Iâ€™ve made over time,â€ù he acknowledges, â€œis not wanting to nurture innovations where I either didnâ€™t get the business model or we didnâ€™t have it.â€ù,But those days are past, Mr. Ballmer declares, saying that he and Microsoft have learned their lessons. He pointed to Microsoftâ€™s , video game console, its Zune music player, Internet search and online advertising as examples of big investments the company is making in businesses that are very different from its lucrative stronghold in PC software.,â€œI think weâ€™ve shown more willingness to embrace new models than anyone else in the technology business,â€ù he asserts. â€œWill it be good enough? Letâ€™s see.â€ù,THE prevailing image of Mr. Ballmer, 50, is mainly that of a marketing dynamo â€” a hyperkinetic, booming orator who can fire up the sales staff and industry partners to labor tirelessly on Microsoftâ€™s behalf. He has strained his vocal cords when shouting at sales meetings. Years ago, his gestures became so animated in a meeting with reporters that he cut himself in the face with a fingernail and, bleeding, continued on, extolling the virtues of the latest Microsoft offering.,Videos on the Web of Mr. Ballmer at large Microsoft gatherings several years ago, when he was heavier, show him bounding across the stage, mostly screaming. In one, he finally comes to the podium to shout to the audience, â€œI have four words for you: I love this company.â€ù,People typically have one of two reactions when they witness this behavior â€”  either, â€œThis is a man whose stability is in doubt,â€ù or  â€œThis guy is no corporate politician â€” he really believes.â€ù,Trailing Mr. Ballmer this month, at a pair of speeches and small meetings with industry groups and customers, suggests that his performances have become more subtle. Speaking to several hundred people at the annual convention of the National Retail Federation in New York (one of about 120 such speeches he gives a year) he orates without notes or a teleprompter and paces the stage, rarely standing still for more than a couple of seconds. He tells the retailers of the two years he spent as an assistant product manager at Procter & Gamble  before attending Stanford business school. (Then, in 1980,  his old Harvard classmate Mr. Gates persuaded him to join Microsoft.),Mr. Ballmer gives the retailers a glimpse of how consumers will increasingly use technology to search, compare prices and shop. He tells them, â€œOur company is committed to retail, and invested in your success.â€ù During a question-and-answer period, he says the â€œheart and soulâ€ù of connecting to the Internet, either by cellphone or PC, is â€œlikely to be a Microsoft operating system running a Microsoft browser.â€ù The unstated, but clear, message is this: stick with Microsoft, the safe choice.,On the floor of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, Michael Mauerer was pinning his start-up companyâ€™s success to Microsoft technology. His company, Retail Teamwork, is building software to automate the purchasing, sales and store operations of small to midsize retailers. His product is being built on the Microsoftâ€™s business applications software, a market that Microsoft entered in the last few years. â€œMicrosoft is a very safe bet,â€ù Mr. Mauerer said. â€œTheyâ€™ve never failed. They ultimately get it right.â€ù,Before and after the morning speech to retailers, Mr. Ballmer holds  a dozen small meetings with senior managers from retailers including Wal-Mart, Circuit City, Safeway and Crate & Barrel. The next morning, after a five-mile run in Central Park, Mr. Ballmer has an 8 a.m. meeting with about two dozen corporate customers, mostly from Wall Street and commercial banks. In front of this smaller group of sophisticated information technology managers, Mr. Ballmer gives a very different talk and fields more detailed questions. The topics run from the intricacies of licensing data-center software to Microsoftâ€™s stance toward free software like Linux.,At one point, he says, â€œAll software will become software with a service.â€ù Mr. Ballmer emphasizes the word â€œwith.â€ù The clear message is that Microsoft is embracing the move toward software written by using open Web standards and delivered over the Internet, but that these software services will be added to Microsoft products instead of replacing them. We will move to the new world, he suggests, but will not cannibalize our flagship products.,Mr. Ballmer tracks his calendar with a detailed Excel spreadsheet. â€œI have a religious budget on my time,â€ù he says. Part of the religion is spending time with customers, about a third of his schedule. He jokes with his wife, Connie, and some colleagues that meetings with customers are his â€œSally Field moments,â€ù a reference to a 1991 movie, â€œSoapdish.â€ù (In it, Ms. Field played a TV soap opera star whose most enjoyable time is spent mixing with ordinary fans at shopping malls.),â€œI get energy from seeing our customers,â€ù Mr. Ballmer explains. â€œIt reminds me of the things weâ€™re doing well and it also reminds me of the things where we need to improve.â€ù,Like many math geeks, Mr. Ballmer has a strong affinity for numbers. Colleagues describe him as extremely analytic when it comes to dissecting business plans and financial projections.,â€œHe has a near-photographic memory for facts, and he can scan a spreadsheet and zoom in on the one aberrant figure that suggests a problem,â€ù observes Craig Mundie, the chief research and strategy officer.,Robert J. Bach, another senior Microsoft executive, says: â€œI like to think Iâ€™m analytical, but Iâ€™m not in the same ZIP code as Steve.â€ù,But Mr. Ballmer says he does much of his thinking by talking to people. He likes to â€œwallowâ€ù in an issue, as he puts it, consulting customers, industry partners and Microsoft managers, often face to face. Numbers are important, he  says, â€œbut for me itâ€™s different to see, touch and feel than it is to just sit there and look at kind of dry statistics.â€ù,He uses e-mail, but not like Mr. Gates, whose decision-making is far more solitary. Mr. Gates reads deeply, writes lengthy strategy documents and then sends them to senior  staff members. â€œSteve is very different,â€ù says one Microsoft executive, who requested anonymity. â€œHis north star is very tuned to the last customer or industry partner he talked to.â€ù,Computing is essentially math on steroids, and writing code is a deeply mathematical skill. And in his student days, Mr. Ballmer was an outstanding math student. He seemed to have all the makings of a computer whiz. But he says he gravitated to the business side of the technology industry because he wanted a more social career than that of a software engineer, with its long stretches of solitary toil. He decided that he lacked the temperament to really excel as a programmer.,Growing up in suburban Detroit, the son of a midlevel manager at the Ford Motor Company, Mr. Ballmer earned a scholarship in his freshman year of high school to Detroit Country Day School, an academically demanding private school. He transferred from a public school and arrived at the private school a year behind in his math work. But he soon caught up and surpassed other students, helped by his math teacher, Edward Kuss, whom Mr. Ballmer called â€œa major force in my lifeâ€ù for igniting his interest in math.,Mr. Ballmer took college graduate courses in math at nights with Mr. Kuss, participated in a summer National Science Foundation math program for advanced students and scored a perfect 800 on the math SAT exam. Mr. Kuss, now an actuary for an insurance company in Ohio, said Mr. Ballmer was fun to teach because â€œhe just soaked it up.â€ù,Yet Mr. Kuss recalled that what impressed him most was when Mr. Ballmer said his proudest achievement was shaving 20 seconds off his time running the quarter-mile. Even then, his time wasnâ€™t good, and his main event in track was the shot put.,To his former teacher, Mr. Ballmerâ€™s remark years ago speaks of persistence and character. â€œThe things that he was good at and came easily to him, like math and science, he enjoyed,â€ù Mr. Kuss observed. â€œBut the things he had to struggle with were the things that gave him the most satisfaction.â€ù,Mr. Ballmer went to Harvard, assuming that he would pursue a career in the sciences or math. He recalled taking a couple of physics and math courses during his freshman year. â€œI was doing a lot of problem sets by myself, time in my room,â€ù he said. â€œBy the end of my freshman year, I decided it wasnâ€™t me. I knew I needed more interaction with people for me to be happy.â€ù,So he tilted his academic work away from science and toward business. He still kept a strong interest in math, majoring in applied mathematics as well as economics. He scored high in the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition,  an exam sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America; he did better than Mr. Gates â€” no math slouch himself.,But Mr. Ballmer also took on extracurricular pursuits. He was a manager for the football team and worked on the business side of The Harvard Crimson  newspaper and The Advocate, the college literary journal.,AFTER he graduated, Mr. Ballmer went to work for Procter & Gamble, as an assistant brand manager for products like Duncan Hines brownie mix. The marketing trainees worked in small offices at the Cincinnati headquarters with their desks shoved together. Another young brand manager in the same office was Jeffrey R. Immelt, who is now chief executive of,Mr. Ballmerâ€™s â€œintelligence and passion,â€ù Mr. Immelt recalled, were apparent back then.  â€œHe was loud, spirited and fun, pretty much the same guy he is now,â€ù Mr. Immelt said.,The two men have remained friends over the years, occasionally playing golf together and talking about business. One subject the two have discussed repeatedly is the necessity for big companies to constantly keep evolving and trying new things, some of which will succeed and some of which will fail. G.E., founded in the 19th century,  has been evolving and trying new things for decades, Mr. Immelt said, while Microsoft has started to do so as well. â€œMy sense is that Steve really understands that and is committed to it,â€ù Mr. Immelt said. â€œThat takes courage.â€ù,Today, Mr. Ballmer is a member of the upper-tier of the worldâ€™s superrich. His current stake in Microsoft is worth $12.7 billion.,He rides a corporate jet for the roughly 200,000 air miles he logs annually on business, and he is shadowed by a pair of bodyguards. But his personal lifestyle is more comfortably affluent than ostentatious. His wife and his three sons live in the same two-story brick house in suburban Seattle that he bought before he was married. He has coached Little League, though no longer, friends say.  He makes sure he is back home as many evenings and weekends as possible, for camping trips, Seattle SuperSonics games and other family outings.,Pushing Microsoft outside its traditional comfort zone, Mr. Ballmer acknowledges, has not always been his first instinct. Microsoft was slow to invest in the market for software linking PCs in office networks in the 1980s and early â€™90s, he said, because the business looked very different from the market for desktop PC software. That hesitation allowed Novell to get a big early lead in PC networking software.,In 1998, when he became president of Microsoft, after managing product divisions and sales worldwide, Mr. Ballmer thought that the company was in too many businesses. He questioned, for example, whether Microsoft should be in the hardware business, making computer keyboards and mice. He was talked out of jettisoning hardware, and the expertise that Microsoft gleaned from that business made it easier later for the company to develop other promising hardware products, like Xbox and Zune.,In 1999, Microsoft sold Sidewalk, an online city guide service. It seemed a wayward foray outside Microsoftâ€™s software business at the time. â€œBut Sidewalk was really aimed at what we now call local search,â€ù Mr. Ballmer says. â€œSidewalk is one we should not have gotten out of.â€ù,Today, he says, he tries to prod Microsoft to widen its vision. â€œFocus is an essential thing, but you sort of want to focus short-term and be expansive long-term,â€ù he explains. â€œIf you really want to be a technology company thatâ€™s relevant and important and driving value for the long run, youâ€™ve got to have big eyes.â€ù,When Mr. Ballmer entered the computer business, and for years afterward, ,was the dominant company â€” â€œit was everything, the grand pooh-bah,â€ù he says. And, certainly, I.B.M.â€™s decision to use Microsoftâ€™s Disk Operating System, when the computer giant introduced its first PC in 1981, set the upstart software maker on its way. Mr. Ballmer says he admires and respects I.B.M., especially the way it transformed itself into a technology services company when the profits from I.B.M.â€™s mainframe business plummeted in the 1990s in the face of competition from lower-cost computers. I.B.M. changed its business model, and saved itself.,Yet Mr. Ballmer sees another important lesson in I.B.M.â€™s evolution. Over the years, I.B.M. pared back in businesses it once led. It got out of data center networking, and , became the leader. In computer chips, I.B.M. ceded the PC microprocessor market to,. Once I.B.M. was a leader in the software that companies use to run their factories, procurement and finances, but it pulled back from that market and,took over.,â€œI think if I.B.M. had been more willing to be expansive in its product portfolio and its innovation, and more long-term in its approach, it would be a very different company today,â€ù Mr. Ballmer says. â€œThatâ€™s my opinion, but itâ€™s a fundamental learning for me.â€ù,SO where, exactly, has Microsoft been expansive? Mr. Ballmer and others at the company point to Microsoftâ€™s video gaming business, led by its Xbox machines. Believing that software was playing an increasing role in consumer electronics, and that Internet-connected video machines looked to be a vital on-ramp for delivering technology to homes, the company decided to take a leap into video gaming at a meeting on Valentineâ€™s Day 2000, shortly after Mr. Ballmer became chief executive.,The meeting, in the Microsoft boardroom on the corporate campus in Redmond, Wash., was scheduled for an hour, but it lasted more than three hours. A handful of executives attended, including Mr. Gates,  Mr. Ballmer  and Mr. Bach, who now leads the Xbox and Zune units.,â€œThe real discussion came down to some very hard choices about Microsoft deciding to do something that was really not our normal model,â€ù Mr. Bach recalls. A video game console is tailored for playing games, unlike a personal computer, which is a general-purpose system. The Xbox would run its own software. â€œItâ€™s not Windows,â€ù Mr. Bach says, â€œand we donâ€™t pretend itâ€™s Windowsâ€ù â€” a notion that was heretical inside Microsoft when Xbox was first concocted.,Mr. Ballmer, according to Mr. Bach, told the participants at the meeting that they would not leave the room until a decision was made. When agreement was reached, Mr. Ballmer told Mr. Bach and J Allard, the leader of the Xbox development team: â€œI wonâ€™t be second-guessing you every third month. I trust this team; go get it done,â€ù as Mr. Bach recalled.,The Xbox shipped in November 2001 and struggled at first, as gamers flinched at its $299 price. Within months, Microsoft cut the price by $100, and sales picked up; it eventually sold more than 24 million consoles. The next-generation Xbox 360, equipped for online gaming, arrived in the fall of 2005, beating Sonyâ€™s , 3 to market by a year. More than 10.5 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold, and half of the buyers subscribe to Xbox Live, an online gaming service.,Still, despite investing billions, Microsoft has yet to show any profit from its video game venture. â€œLook, the jury is still out,â€ù Mr. Ballmer acknowledges. â€œBut I feel very confident that weâ€™ve built a good market position with Xbox. I feel very confident that weâ€™re on track to make money.â€ù The company has said the Xbox business, including hardware and software, should move into the black this year, but when, and if, the business will pay back its multibillion-dollar investment is unclear.,And Zune, introduced late last year, is just beginning a long and costly uphill fight against Appleâ€™s , business in the digital music market. â€œNo other company, for better or worse, would be willing to get into that business at this time,â€ù  Mr. Ballmer says.,The new product lines are Mr. Ballmerâ€™s answer to the most nettlesome questions about Microsoftâ€™s future: Where will it find new growth as the Windows and Office businesses continue to mature? Can Microsoft navigate its way to a future that is as bright as its past?,The challenge comes amid a leadership transition at Microsoft, as Mr. Gates prepares to stop working daily at Microsoft by mid-2008, though he will remain the board chairman and the largest shareholder.  Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Gates have shared one of the most enduring and lucrative partnerships in American business over the years.  Put simply, Mr. Gates has served as the main architect and master strategist at Microsoft, while Mr. Ballmer has served more as the tactical field marshal.,From the outset, Mr. Gates recalls in his e-mail message, â€œit was clear to me that Steveâ€™s skills would be absolutely essential to our success.â€ù Though their talents and personalities are different, Mr. Gates said, â€œwe have a common view at the highest level of what the company needs to do to succeed: hire great people, make big bets and take the long view and be patient where we think there are the greatest opportunities.â€ù,Mr. Ballmer has been the companyâ€™s chief executive since 2000. But on the day Mr. Gates announced his plans to spend more time on philanthropy, Mr. Ballmer recalled, he felt as if he was entering a â€œnew eraâ€ù personally and that he had a â€œnew job.â€ù,If Mr. Ballmer has entered a new era personally, some things still havenâ€™t changed. Not long ago, after finishing off a conversation with an aide, he backed up quickly and banged into a reporter, sending him reeling. With a helping hand and grin, Mr. Ballmer joked: â€œSo much for the kinder, gentler Ballmer. Heâ€™s still knocking people down.â€ù,To the degree that a kinder, gentler Mr. Ballmer â€” and Microsoft â€” truly exist today, it is largely a legacy of the antitrust rulings against the company in the United States and Europe. A series of federal court rulings in the United States several years ago found Microsoft to have repeatedly bullied rivals and industry partners to illegally thwart competition. Until the court setbacks, Mr. Ballmer, like Mr. Gates, dismissed any suggestion that Microsoft had done anything wrong. Their view was that the suits against their company were the handiwork of disgruntled competitors lobbying antitrust regulators.,But once Microsoft lost, it became Mr. Ballmerâ€™s job to settle its legal troubles and repair the damage to the companyâ€™s reputation. He appointed a new general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, and directed him to talk to and cooperate with people previously regarded as Microsoft enemies: government officials and competitors.,Mr. Smith says his job has been made easier by Mr. Ballmerâ€™s willingness to meet people on their own turf. For example, Mr. Ballmer opened settlement talks over a round of golf in California with  Scott G. McNealy, Sun Microsystemsâ€™ chairman, and addressed the French Senate in fluent French. (Mr. Ballmer spent two years in elementary school in Brussels.) An antitrust dispute remains with Europe. But Microsoft has settled state and federal lawsuits in the United States while paying more than $4 billion in private settlements related to the federal case.,Forging better relations with industry rivals is a business strategy as well as a legal tactic for Microsoft because the complexity and broad dissemination of information technology means that Microsoft simply canâ€™t opt to go it alone anymore.,Cooperate-and-compete relationships are common among companies selling technology for data centers, the engine rooms where companies run customer databases, the back end of e-mail systems, and the like. There are many data center competitors, unlike the PC software market where Windows and Office programs hold more than a 90 percent share. Still, Microsoft has grown rapidly in the corporate software market, with revenue reaching more than $11 billion last year, though that business is far less profitable than Windows or Office.,MICROSOFT and ,, a large maker of data storage systems, have built a strong partnership in the last couple of years; the two companies conduct joint marketing programs generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. â€œItâ€™s a great relationship,â€ù said Joseph M. Tucci, the chief executive of EMC.,Well, not always. In 2003, EMC bought VMware, a fast-growing Silicon Valley venture that makes software allowing computers to run multiple operating systems. Microsoft is working on this technology, known as a virtual machine, and VMwareâ€™s software has the potential to undermine the importance of operating systems, Microsoftâ€™s mainstay.,Just before EMC announced the purchase, Mr. Tucci called Mr. Ballmer to let him know, as a courtesy. Fine, Mr. Ballmer replied, but did Mr. Tucci know that a senior member of VMwareâ€™s technical staff had just agreed to join Microsoft? Mr. Ballmer apparently could not resist the competitive jab, but the move backfired. Alerted, EMC and VMware executives persuaded the senior scientist, who had already looked at schools for his children in Seattle, to stay.,Mr. Tucci laughed about the episode. â€œWeâ€™re mostly partners,â€ù he said, â€œbut Steve is going to try to beat the heck out of us in that market, and weâ€™re going to try to beat the heck out of Microsoft.â€ù Mr. Tucci has known Mr. Ballmer for years and says the Microsoft leader has become more broad-minded. â€œSteve Ballmer is an intense competitor, and he still has to win,â€ù Mr. Tucci observed. â€œBut he has come around to the view that this is a big environment, and others have to win, too.â€ù,In the end, Mr. Ballmer must come up a winner in Internet services like search and untether Microsoftâ€™s software from the desktop by transforming it into a service that is distributed and accessed over the Internet â€” both trends in which Google is the early leader.,Inside Microsoft, there are differing views on the nature and immediacy of those threats. Microsoft, some executives point out, has trailed in previous technology waves, only to catch up and surpass rivals. Apple was the path-breaking innovator in point-and-click graphical computing with the Macintosh operating system, but Microsoftâ€™s Windows eventually became the big winner in the marketplace. In the 1990s, Netscape was the early leader in Internet browser software, only to have Microsoft catch up and smother that competitive threat.,â€œIs there some new agent, more disruptive than we have faced in the past?â€ù asks Mr. Mundie, the companyâ€™s chief research and strategy officer. â€œNo, not really.â€ù,An internal memo written 15 months ago by Ray Ozzie, who has taken over for Mr. Gates as Microsoftâ€™s chief software architect, had a different tone. It was titled â€œThe Internet Services Disruption,â€ù and it was a call to action. â€œItâ€™s clear that if we fail to do so, our business as we know it is at risk. We must respond quickly and decisively.â€ù,In an interview, Mr. Ozzie framed the challenge further. â€œThis is a big change; thereâ€™s no question about it,â€ù he said. â€œBut itâ€™s been coming since the beginning of the Web.â€ù,The current round of Internet-driven change is different from the 1990s wave. Netscape never got to become the big rich company that Google is. Microsoft bundled its Internet Explorer browser into Windows and gave it away.  But it has no similar way to crush Google search, which is free to consumers and supported by keyword advertising.,Still, analysts say it is also not clear what Googleâ€™s business model will be as it moves increasingly beyond its lucrative stronghold of Internet search. It has many software and service offerings, some entirely online and some requiring small software downloads, including e-mail, satellite mapping, instant messaging, online word processing, spreadsheets and desktop search.,Mr. Ballmer, of course, is watching closely for hints of Googleâ€™s future plans. â€œItâ€™s not like they are getting much ad revenue out of any of it,â€ù he says. â€œNothing out of Gtalk; nothing out of documents and spreadsheets. Are they going to try to trash our business, just give it away to help their business? Maybe. Weâ€™ll see.â€ù,Mr. Ballmer and other Microsoft executives often scorn online alternatives to its desktop software as second-class options with no market. Internet-based software, they say, lacks the features and functions of Microsoftâ€™s â€œrich clientâ€ù programs. Also, what happens when computer users are not connected to the Internet, say, on an airplane?,Thatâ€™s wishful thinking on Microsoftâ€™s part, according to the Internet insurgents from Google and elsewhere. They say Microsoftâ€™s critiques attack older, browser-only programs instead of newer software services that place some applications on PCs while also linking the machines over the Web to supercomputing data centers. New features and services, they say, can flow to users every time they tap in, instead of waiting three years for the next version of Office. The classic work-on-a-plane problem? Researchers, they add, are working on caching software and other innovations to solve those kinds of issues.,Eric E. Schmidt, Googleâ€™s chief executive, discussed the implications of this â€œemergent new software applications architectureâ€ù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in a meeting with computer scientists in Washington last fall.,â€œSo the obvious question becomes to what degree can this replace the traditional Windows-dominant, PC-dominant, monopoly structure that weâ€™ve all been used to,â€ù  Mr. Schmidt said. â€œItâ€™s pretty clear to me that there are enough people working on this in research universities and in companies, building applications that empower this, to make it happen.â€ù,Microsoft recognizes the threat. The company has top technical talent working on Internet services, and it has brought out offerings like Office Live, a package of services to help small businesses set up Web sites. But some industry analysts say Microsoft is being too timid, fearful of cutting into its traditional PC software business. â€œMicrosoft is now focused and engaged, but we havenâ€™t seen much yet,â€ù said Richard G. Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. â€œWhereâ€™s Office delivered as a service? Whereâ€™s the online versions of Excel, Word and Powerpoint?â€ù,Microsoft, Mr. Sherlund said, has to recognize that â€œthere will probably be some cannibalization of Microsoftâ€™s existing business, but thatâ€™s the price of customer acquisition going forward in Internet services.â€ù,â€œAnd it could turn out to be a good business for Microsoft,â€ù he added, â€œif they can generate online traffic and make money with better search and advertising.â€ù,Mr. Ballmer replies that there are different paths to putting more of Microsoftâ€™s offerings online as Internet services that rely on subscriptions or advertising to generate revenue. â€œI guarantee you that all of those options have been considered, and some are being pursued,â€ù he says, declining to elaborate.,TO succeed, Microsoft must convince new recruits that it will be a leader as the next wave of computing unfolds, and not just a defender of the status quo. Microsoft has suffered a few high-level defections of senior technical people recently, but has managed to lure some top talent as well.,In 2005, Gary Flake left his post as the head of research at Yahoo to join Microsoft, where he set up Live Labs, its Internet research unit. Until Microsoft wooed him in earnest, Mr. Flake,39, said he had not considered working for the company. He was a product of Silicon Valleyâ€™s technology culture, and he said he had been recruited by Google and saw Microsoft as the old-line enemy.,But Mr. Flake decided to join Microsoft after, he says, he came away â€œstunned at how open the company was to change, how self-critical the culture was.â€ù,â€œMicrosoft, more than the others, is redefining itself,â€ù he added. â€œAnd I do think Microsoft is in a position to raise the bar for what is possible in Internet services.â€ù,Embracing the Internet may be part of Mr. Ballmerâ€™s agenda, but he is still left with the chore of defending and milking Microsoftâ€™s huge cash cows, Windows and Office. When he talks about the Web, he accents the need for accelerated innovation.,In the same breath that he emphasizes innovation, Mr. Ballmer describes his new strategy in the vernacular that Microsoft has been using for years: â€œembrace and extendâ€ù â€” in other words, new products and services should simply be extensions of the old. Even if rivals and industry experts doubt that the old Microsoft game plan will work this time, Mr. Ballmer is certain that it will.,â€œWe will do well,â€ù he told a group of investors and analysts at the companyâ€™s headquarters last year. â€œWhether itâ€™s me or the guy who replaces me because we donâ€™t do well. Weâ€™ll keep coming," and we will do well.â€ù""",STEVE LOHR,"JAN. 28, 2007",Preaching From the Ballmer Pulpit,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/business/yourmoney/28ballmer.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only thing stretching across the entrance to the Bay Front Estates at Mill Basin last week, over a mud-and-gravel road split by a trench for the new water and sewer pipes, was a string of multicolored flags, sagging from a pair of long two-by-fours driven into the raw ground.,But while the development, in southeastern Brooklyn, is still unfinished and the lavish single-family houses inside have only begun to sell, there is a sign that something unusual is afoot. On either side of the entrance, a few feet from each of the ersatz flagpoles, are little guard huts. Once the road is done, the people in the huts will control access to that rarest of New York development phenomena: a gated community.,â€œJust about everyone in Florida lives in one now, and Las Vegas, but they are kind of rare in our area,â€ù said the developmentâ€™s exclusive broker, Tony vanderBeek of Coldwell Banker Mid Plaza Real Estate.,â€¢,True, New York City has a small number of long-established gated communities, like Sea Gate in Brooklyn and Breezy Point in Queens. But the Bay Front Estates is new, and at least one more is on the way, in Brooklynâ€™s Bergen Beach. That fenced-off complex is called Mill Harbor Condominiums, and according to its Web site, it will offer its residents â€œsuburban lifestyle close to Manhattan.â€ù,Surprisingly enough, a suburban way of life is just what many people are after, said Dorothy Turano, district manager of Community Board 18, which includes Bergen Beach and Mill Basin.,On the Bay Front Estates site, the board pushed for low-density housing during a tortuous, decade-long rezoning process that saw the rise and fall of multiple development proposals for the land, a fallow stretch across the water from Kings Plaza Mall. In the end, Ms. Turano said, the board was thrilled with the plan by the Queens-based developer H & H Builders for a gated, strictly residential community.,â€œWe donâ€™t have mixed uses here, and we donâ€™t want them,â€ù she said. â€œWe donâ€™t think you should mix commercial and residential. It doesnâ€™t work, not in Brooklyn. The boroughs, theyâ€™re more suburban and we want to keep it suburban.â€ù,State Senator Carl Kruger, who represents the neighborhood, said he was impressed by Bay Front Estates, with its meandering road and decorative streetlights, and the flexibility it will give a future homeownersâ€™ association to determine its own level of security.,â€œItâ€™s exactly what weâ€™d like to be able to replicate on undeveloped parcels throughout the community,â€ù he said.,In the section of Mill Basin near the site, the houses are similar to, if smaller than, the ones inside where the gate will be. The neighboring houses are brick on the first floor, with white siding or shingles above. The homes at Bay Front Estates have stucco. The neighboring homes are detached from one another, with yards, driveways and even garages.,The streets were largely quiet on a recent afternoon, but  comments by the few residents who were out suggested that the new estates were no big deal.,â€œI donâ€™t think anything is really a big deal around here,â€ù 23-year-old Daniel Bykhovsky, who was walking to the bus, said wryly.,So far, Mr. vanderBeek said, four of the new houses have been sold. Twenty others have been built, and 10 lots on the water are set aside for custom houses. The asking prices for the existing houses begin at $1.35 million.,The gate that will be installed at the entrance, he said, is less about safety than about creating a sense of distinctness for the homes within: five-bedroom houses with marble bathrooms. They are, Mr. vanderBeek said, â€œthe nicest houses in the area.â€ù,â€¢,Construction at the Mill Harbor Condominiums is scheduled to continue until the end of the year, but new owners are to begin moving in next month. Sean Lavin, one of the partners in Parkmore Development, which is building the complex, said the gate would distinguish the walkable, garden-style units from the detached one- and two-family homes nearby.,â€œItâ€™s not so much that youâ€™re preventing people from getting in there,â€ù Mr. Lavin said. â€œI think people liked the idea of added security. They didnâ€™t feel the necessity to have it, but itâ€™s similar to being in a doorman building, where it adds a sense of exclusivity.â€ù",JAKE MOONEY,"JAN. 28, 2007",Gates in Place of Doormen,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/nyregion/thecity/28stre.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WITH all the targeted marketing out there, and the customer satisfaction surveys and opinion polls that companies seem to offer at every turn, you might think that employers could get a handle on which employee benefits are most popular among their workers.,You might think that â€” but you would be wrong.,Employers and employees have widely divergent views on the appeal of a whole range of benefits, and the differences are wider now than they have been in years, according to several recently released surveys.,The differences are large enough that I canâ€™t help thinking of those troubled relationships in â€œCan This Marriage Be Saved?,â€ù the long-running marital advice column in Ladiesâ€™ Home Journal.,Some 86 percent of the 262 employers in a study by Watson Wyatt, the consulting firm, said they believed that their organization was treating employees well, and more than half expected to do a better job of treating employees well in the future. But only 55 percent of the 1,100 employees in the study believed they were well treated, and just 24 percent thought they would be treated better in the future.,Employers also appeared to have little sense of why high-performing employees might leave the organization: not one employer said health care benefits would play a role, but 22 percent of the top performers themselves said that those benefits would be important.,â€œIf I was surprised by anything, it was the degree of the disconnect and then that it ran across the spectrum from the highest-level summary statement of â€˜We think we treat our employees wellâ€™ on down to the specifics,â€ù said Laura Sejen, Watson Wyattâ€™s practice director in charge of strategic rewards. â€œThink of it like tectonic plates. Weâ€™re on a crash course and somethingâ€™s going to have to give.â€ù,In another study measuring employeesâ€™ commitment and motivation on the job, employees were less satisfied with every aspect of compensation than they had been in previous years, from overall pay to the pay system itself. This was true even though raises have consistently ranged from 3.7 percent to 4 percent for the last several years, according to Jim Kochanski, a senior vice president at Sibson Consulting, which undertook the study.,â€œThereâ€™s a huge drop in satisfaction with their pay increases even if their pay increases were the same as theyâ€™ve been,â€ù Mr. Kochanski said. The differences are not all that surprising if you take the long view. For the last decade or more, many employers have shown a willingness to scale back their work force if it makes strategic sense.,At the same time, as they have faced steep increases in the cost of health care, many have responded by scaling back what they provide or by asking employees to pay for more themselves. And accounting rule changes have made it more costly to offer options to lots of employees.,Many employers are now putting more emphasis on other benefits, like flex-time options and enhanced career development, that are often enormously popular with certain segments of the work force, like younger workers with children.,But for large numbers of employees, who have perhaps lived through layoffs and sharp cuts in benefits, those kinds of goodies are less attractive than cash. Sure enough, while employers in the Watson Wyatt survey believed that the biggest reasons that top-performing employees changed jobs were career development and promotion opportunities, top-performing employees themselves said the biggest reason for moving would be pay.,If the labor market had more slack, the disconnect between employer and employee might not affect much beyond employee morale. But in a tight market for highly skilled workers, the effect can be very different.,For employers who want to head off major defections, the advice often given in â€œCan This Marriage ... â€ù applies: communication is vital. Surveys can reveal a wealth of information about what benefits workers want most. So can solid analyses of work force demographics: younger employers are more likely to care about benefits like child care subsidies and generous leave policies, while older workers might focus almost solely on health and retirement benefits., a gas and electric utility based in Columbia, S.C., is one company that has studied the demographics of its work force. Roughly half of its employees will be eligible to retire in the next 5 to 10 years, said Chris McSwain, director of compensation and benefits, so he plans to use benefits to attract and retain workers and to make the transition as smooth as possible.,Last November, Scana officials began meeting with focus groups of employees of different ages â€” one group in their 20s, one in their 40s, and so on â€” and asked about their preferences for different supplemental benefits, like phased-in retirement and training seminars.,After studying the results, the company plans to offer a package of add-on benefits; employees can choose among them to supplement those they already receive. Benefits already include free access to certain prescription drugs and discounted prices on others.,â€œWe know weâ€™re going to have some turnover, and we know the needs of people joining the company will be different from the people leaving,â€ù Mr. McSwain said. â€œWe want to adjust to balance the needs of those with us along with those of the people joining us in the next five years.â€ù,Turnover is less of an issue at the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System, but the organization faces a continual challenge from the wealth of job opportunities its employees have in the New York City area. So G. Thomas Ferguson, senior vice president and chief human resources officer, commissions regular employee-satisfaction surveys to take their pulse on a range of subjects.,â€œSome of our employees can change jobs and not even change their â€˜going to work and coming homeâ€™ pattern,â€ù Mr. Ferguson said.,The first survey, undertaken shortly after Mr. Fergusonâ€™s arrival at NewYork-Presbyterian, in 2001, found that 59 percent of the organizationâ€™s employees were satisfied with their benefits â€” not bad when compared with the national average of 56 percent for health care organizations, but not great. Annual employee turnover, at 13 to 14 percent, was also close to the national average for health care organizations.,So, in the last several years, NewYork-Presbyterian has stepped up communication with employees about available benefits. It has also pushed for price concessions from vendors to contain the costs of the benefits it offers, in order to keep employee contributions from increasing too much.,NewYork-Presbyterian also allows employees to buy what amount to supplements to their benefits, like added life insurance and legal services, at discounts. Mr. Ferguson estimated that between 30 percent and 50 percent of employees bought some kind of supplemental benefit.,In a July 2006 survey of employees, satisfaction with benefits stood at 71 percent, Mr. Ferguson said; he estimated that turnover now runs about 10 percent.,â€œWe want to be able to hire and keep the best people and have them be satisfied,â€ù he said. â€œItâ€™s good human relations. Itâ€™s also good business.â€ù",KELLEY HOLLAND,"JAN. 28, 2007",Inside the Minds of Your Employees,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/business/yourmoney/28mgmt.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THE ability of The New York Times to maintain its ethical standards among its far-flung outside contributors continues to be a major concern of mine. As these freelancers fill column after column at a lower cost than full-time reporters, readers have a right to expect that editors ensure the integrity of that journalism.,But embarrassing gaps continue to beset The Timesâ€™s online ethics questionnaire, introduced last April to ascertain whether freelancers meet the paperâ€™s fundamental ethical standards before they get assignments. Recently, articles by two freelancers suffered from clear conflicts of interest, first spotted by readers who wrote to me.,Brief, upbeat reports written by a frequent Times freelancer about two cellphones made by Samsung appeared Nov. 23 and 30. Then, on Dec. 7, an editorsâ€™ note acknowledged that the author had made an October visit to Samsungâ€™s South Korean offices at the companyâ€™s expense.,An Oct. 15 article on the use of environmentally sensitive building methods and materials featured an Oregon home that was the first in the Western United States to receive a special certification for â€œgreenâ€ù houses. An editorsâ€™ note on Oct. 29 disclosed that the freelance author was employed part time as an editor and writer by a nonprofit organization that promotes a sustainable economy, and that had received financial contributions from the owner of the home.,If Times editors had been aware of the conflicts, both editorsâ€™ notes concluded, the two freelancers would not have been given the assignments. But why, I began to ask senior editors after the second note appeared, had the new online ethics questionnaire failed to detect these conflicts?,As I continued to pursue these questions, the problem was acknowledged in a Jan. 16 memo to the staff from Craig R. Whitney and William E. Schmidt, both assistant managing editors. â€œRecently, weâ€™ve seen several cases of freelancersâ€™ apparent unfamiliarity with provisions of the Ethical Journalism policy ... despite the vetting system we put in place last spring to try to ensure that they would be aware of the policy,â€ù they wrote.,In a push in the right direction, the memo requires editors to ask freelancers if they are â€œfamiliar with our ethics rulesâ€ù the next time each is given an assignment â€” and to â€œmake it clear that continuing to contribute to The Times depends on observing those rules.â€ù If a freelancer â€œdeliberately disregardsâ€ù the paperâ€™s Ethical Journalism guidelines, â€œwe stop giving assignments to that person,â€ù the two editors warned.,So how did the freelancer conflicts on these stories escape detection before publication?,The freelancer who took the Samsung junket, John Biggs, had responded to the online ethics questionnaire for outside contributors in May, shortly after it became a requirement. â€œHave you accepted any free trips, junkets or press trips in the last two years?â€ù one question asked. His negative response was accurate at that time, according to Mr. Whitney, who is also the paperâ€™s standards editor.,After taking the October junket, primarily to write for ,, a blog about electronic gear, Mr. Biggs told me, he â€œsimply forgotâ€ù about updating his ethics questionnaire response so Times editors would be aware of his conflict of interest and not assign him any Samsung stories. His editor doesnâ€™t share his vague recollection that he mentioned Samsungâ€™s role in his trip. In any case, comments he posted on CrunchGear on Oct. 17, the day he arrived in Seoul, make it clear to me that he understood the unethical aspect of junkets. â€œIâ€™m here with Samsung,â€ù he wrote, â€œsuckling on the sweet teat of junket whoredom.â€ù,Unfortunately, The Timesâ€™s online ethics questionnaire system requires updating of freelancer responses only every two years. Mr. Biggs, who in recent months has been writing brief articles almost every week for the business section, wasnâ€™t asked to update his responses before writing the two stories about Samsung products in November.,The writer of the article lauding the Oregon builderâ€™s â€œgreenâ€ù house, Colleen Kaleda, had also responded to the ethics questionnaire in May. Asked to list her current employers, â€œwhether full time or part time,â€ù she omitted the Sightline Institute, where she did editing and writing and was then listed as the â€œassociate editorâ€ù of Tidepool, its online news service. Ms. Kaleda told me that she hadnâ€™t listed Sightline as a part-time employer because of â€œthe small amount of work involved.â€ù She has told Times editors that she wasnâ€™t aware when she quoted him in the article that the homeâ€™s owner had donated to Sightline.,A Times editor reviewed Ms. Kaledaâ€™s May responses when he assigned her the article for the real estate section in late summer. I think itâ€™s likely that correctly listing her work for Sightline would have raised enough questions to bring to light the nonprofitâ€™s focus on a sustainable economy and the donations from the owner of the featured home. But Ms. Kaledaâ€™s listing of her volunteer work for the Oregon League of Conservation Voters should have also triggered questions from her editor, and it didnâ€™t.,Before issuing the new warning about deliberately disregarding the paperâ€™s ethics rules, Mr. Whitney had ruled that there should be minimal restrictions on the two freelancers. Mr. Biggs, he determined, is not eligible for any assignments about Samsung products, and Ms. Kaleda is not to be assigned articles about environmental issues.,Most freelancers, itâ€™s important to note, follow the paperâ€™s guidelines and deliver valuable articles to readers of The Times. And full-time news staffers donâ€™t always adhere to the paperâ€™s ethical standards. As some outside contributors were quick to remind me when I first called for stronger editing and ethical oversight for them, Jayson Blair was not a freelancer. But the number of freelancers in the paperâ€™s database â€” more than 5,000 â€” and the specter of conflicts raised by their work outside The Times create issues that demand comprehensive and diligent oversight.,The tales of these two freelancers convinced me that readers deserve to have more attention paid to the ethics of outside contributors than the latest memo provides. A key need: an editing staff sufficient to allow extra time to question freelancers and edit their stories. But there are at least two inexpensive changes to the existing online vetting system that could give editors more updated information and increase the pressure on outside contributors to read its ethical rules.,Each assignment should require that the  freelancer has responded to the online ethics questionnaire within the previous 30 days; the two-year interval is useless. And there should be an additional â€œquestionâ€ù that confirms the reading, or rereading, that day of the 686 words of the complete freelancer ethics rules already posted online underneath the questionnaire; that would make pleading ignorance difficult.,These changes wouldnâ€™t prevent all problems. But they would provide additional protection for the paperâ€™s credibility that is sorely needed.,Times editors have carefully made clear their disapproval of the expression of a personal opinion about Iraq on national television by the paperâ€™s chief military correspondent, Michael Gordon.,The rumored military buildup in Iraq was a hot topic on the Jan. 8 â€œCharlie Roseâ€ù show, and the host asked Mr. Gordon if he believed â€œvictory is within our grasp.â€ù The transcript of Mr. Gordonâ€™s response, which he stressed was â€œpurely personal,â€ù includes these comments:,â€œSo I think, you know, as a purely personal view, I think itâ€™s worth it [sic] one last effort for sure to try to get this right, because my personal view is weâ€™ve never really tried to win. Weâ€™ve simply been managing our way to defeat. And I think that if itâ€™s done right, I think that there is the chance to accomplish something.â€ù,I raised reader concerns about Mr. Gordonâ€™s voicing of personal opinions with top editors, and received a response from Philip Taubman, the Washington bureau chief. After noting that Mr. Gordon has â€œlong been mindful and respectful of the line between analysis and opinion in his television appearances,â€ù Mr. Taubman went on to draw the line in this case.,â€œI would agree with you that he stepped over the line on the â€˜Charlie Roseâ€™ show. I have discussed the appearances with Michael and I am satisfied that the comments on the Rose show were an aberration. They were a poorly worded shorthand for some analytical points about the military and political situation in Baghdad that Michael has made in the newspaper in a more nuanced and unopinionated way. He agrees his comments on the show went too far.â€ù,Itâ€™s a line drawn correctly by Mr. Taubman â€” and accepted honorably by Mr. Gordon.",,"JAN. 28, 2007",Spotting Freelancer Conflicts: A Solution With Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/28pubed.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Boston,ACCORDING to a report released last week by the Harvard School of Public Health, cigarette companies have been steadily increasing the nicotine yield of their cigarettes â€” the report describes an average total increase of 11 percent from 1998 to 2005.,Anti-smoking groups have seized on the report as evidence that the Food and Drug Administration must begin regulating tobacco products.,A steady and significant increase in nicotine in cigarettes over the past eight years or so certainly seems worrisome.  It sounds as though companies like Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros,  are  secretly and deceptively increasing the nicotine in their cigarettes and, apparently, lying about it (since they deny the assertions of the report), all in an effort to increase the addictive potential of their cigarettes and harm the publicâ€™s health.,There are, however, a number of  problems here.,First, though I donâ€™t dispute the reportâ€™s assertion that overall nicotine yields in cigarettes have increased, this does not appear to be the case for Marlboro, the leading cigarette brand that commands over 40 percent of the market.,Using the data on nicotine yields of Marlboro cigarettes provided by Philip Morris to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for  1997 through 2006, I conducted my own analysis of the trends in Marlboro nicotine yields.,The average nicotine yield of 16 Marlboro brands consistently reported for the entire time period was 1.81 milligrams in 1997; in 2006,  it was also 1.81 milligrams. Thus, the average nicotine yield of these cigarettes in 2006 was exactly the same as in 1997, nine years earlier.,Second,  an increase in nicotine yields does not necessarily mean an increase in the harm to smokers. It is well documented that smokers compensate for  changes in nicotine levels   to get a relatively constant nicotine dose.,This is why â€œlightâ€ù cigarettes are not safer products. The nicotine levels in each cigarette may be lower, but smokers simply smoke more of them, negating the potential benefits of reduced nicotine levels. Indeed, smoking many â€œlightâ€ù cigarettes is every bit as dangerous, if not more so, because of the increased exposure to other pollutants in cigarettes, than smoking fewer â€œregularâ€ù cigarettes.,Similarly, if nicotine yields increase, smokers might be expected to compensate by smoking slightly less. This could actually have a marginally positive health benefit if it reduces overall cigarette consumption.,Third, tobacco companies are not necessarily doing anything wrong if they are, in fact, increasing nicotine yields. The paradox of â€œlightâ€ù cigarettes demonstrates that reducing nicotine yields is actually the last thing we would want â€” it would, again,  result only in people smoking more, and thus  increasing tar delivery and the resulting carcinogenic health effects.,The nicotine in cigarettes is indeed a public health problem. But anti-smoking groups have drawn the wrong conclusion from the Harvard report: the problem isnâ€™t whether or not nicotine levels are increasing; itâ€™s that this deadly, addictive product is available in the first place.,For the past two years, public health groups â€” led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids â€” have lobbied for passage of legislation that would grant the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco products; shockingly, this bill, which Senator Edward Kennedy is preparing to re-introduce in the next few weeks, would expressly preclude the F.D.A. from simply removing nicotine from cigarettes.,It remains unclear why public health groups would support such a provision, though presumably itâ€™s their attempt to appease Philip Morris, whose support is deemed necessary to get the proposed legislation through Congress.,Itâ€™s not enough to regulate the varying degrees of nicotine in cigarettes. Ultimately, thereâ€™s only one way to deal with the addictive effects of nicotine, especially on children: grant the F.D.A. the authority to get nicotine out of cigarettes altogether. Anti-smoking groups shouldnâ€™t settle for anything less.",MICHAEL SIEGEL,"JAN. 28, 2007",Unsafe at Any Level,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/opinion/28siegel.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The year 1956 will be remembered in British history mainly for two events, both fatal in their different ways. In the autumn, Anglo-French forces invaded and briefly occupied Egypt in the debacle known as the Suez Crisis, which called time on British imperialism and saw off a prime minister. A few months earlier, at the Royal Court Theater on the edge of Chelsea, John Osborneâ€™s â€œLook Back in Angerâ€ù had its first performance. Osborne was 26, a member of the generation that would oppose Suez, and the attitudes of his first major play and the astonishingly irreverent and fluent invective of its young protagonist, Jimmy Porter, captured a disenchantment in postwar English life that had never been seen on stage before. It shattered the well-bred conventions of English theater â€” to a large extent killed them off â€” and in the wider world became a symbolic text for people who wanted a different kind of Britain; one that, for example, would not have bombed Suez. Osborne, thanks to an alert theater press office, became the first â€œAngry Young Man.â€ù Kenneth Tynan wrote famously in his review, â€œI doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see â€˜Look Back in Anger.â€™ â€ù Mary McCarthy, the playâ€™s early American champion, compared Jimmy Porter to Hamlet, who had also â€œdeclared war upon a rotten society.â€ù Arthur Miller thought it the only modern British play worth seeing.,On the London stage in 1956, it was quite easy to be mistaken for a political radical. Those were the days when plays still needed to be submitted to an antique monarchical institution, the Lord Chamberlain, for censorship and approval. Outside a few comic or sentimental characterizations, the contemporary working classes were rarely depicted. Typical stage architecture might be the inside of a country house, or a balcony overlooking the Mediterranean. No character in â€œLook Back in Angerâ€ù would have been recognized as working class by any member of it â€” Jimmy Porterâ€™s off-stage job at a candy stall was entirely unconvincing â€” but the most prominent feature on the set was an everyday household item, an ironing board, and it was frequently used for actual ironing by Mrs. Porter. In the era of NoÃ«l Coward and Terence Rattigan, where the most useful stage furniture was usually a cocktail cabinet, the sight was remarkable.,That and Jimmyâ€™s vituperation of the repressed, torpid, humbugging nature of English life (especially English womanhood, though that wasnâ€™t generally noticed or condemned at the time) were enough to give â€œLook Backâ€ù a â€œpoliticalâ€ù reputation that now looks to be a category mistake. Osborne wasnâ€™t a radical with an analysis, never mind a program for change. His play is almost pure autobiography, and as John Heilpern makes clear in his biography, the anger in it is so deeply personal, with such singular causes, as to make nonsense of it as politics.,Osborne wrote the play in a month, less than a year after his first marriage had ended bitterly. The onstage marriage of Jimmy and Alison Porter faithfully reproduces the histrionics of Osborneâ€™s marriage to the actress Pamela Lane. The script incorporates one of Laneâ€™s letters, and the game of â€œsquirrels and bears,â€ù whose feyness never ceases to embarrass audiences, is the same playfulness that Osborne and his wife devised to relieve their mutual hatred by escaping into a second childhood.,More important is Osborneâ€™s father, to whom the play is dedicated. In the play, he becomes a victim of the Spanish Civil War, whom 10-year-old Jimmy watched die from his wounds at home in England. (â€œYou see, I learnt at an early age what it was to be angry â€” angry and helpless.â€ù) The 10-year-old Osborne had also watched his father die, though more prosaically of tuberculosis. By using Osborneâ€™s private notebooks, Heilpern establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Osborne thought of this death and that of his only sibling, an older sister â€” also from tuberculosis, before Osborne could remember her â€” as the most formative events in his life and work.,Being dead, and therefore idealized and uncomplicated, Osborneâ€™s father and sister set a standard that few people in his life ever lived up to. Osborne detested and ridiculed his long-surviving mother, a London barmaid whom he would often bring along to smart parties for comic effect (â€œA year in which my mother died canâ€™t be all bad,â€ù he wrote in 1983). Wives came and went. After Pamela Lane came the actress Mary Ure and then the writer Penelope Gilliatt and then another actress, Jill Bennett. Only with his fifth wife, the critic Helen Dawson, was the experience prolonged and agreeable. Osborne married the first four before he was 40 and only Lane reached the age of 65. When he heard of Bennettâ€™s suicide in 1990, he hastily revised a volume of autobiography to include the wish that he could stand over her open coffin and â€œdrop a good, large mess in her eye.â€ù,Heilpern knew Osborne slightly and this book was authorized by his widow, who died in 2004. It is, insofar as such a thing is possible, a sympathetic biography of an unsympathetic man. Heilpern supplies plenty of ghastly detail, but does his best to balance it with evidence of Osborneâ€™s financial generosity, shy charm, frequent depressions and underlying terror (â€œI was born with a sense of loss, a feeling of things withheld and banishedâ€ù). Even so, itâ€™s hard to reach any other conclusion than that Osborne was inexcusably cruel to people in general, and criminally so to those who may have imagined they had some claim to his friendship and love. Put simply, he was awful: a poor friend, a bad son and husband, a worse father. Nolan, his daughter by Gilliatt, came to stay with him when her mother was no longer considered fit to take care of her. Four years later, when she was 16, Osborne expelled her from the house after some ordinary adolescent behavior, cancelling her school fees and her bank account. They never spoke again. The long letter he wrote to her is lyrical in its high-flown damnation of her character (â€œthe grasping ingrate you undoubtedly areâ€ù), almost as though Osborne was enjoying the role of a villainous stepfather in a Victorian melodrama.,The trouble lay in his gift for invective. His four best plays â€” â€œLook Back in Anger,â€ù â€œThe Entertainer,â€ù â€œLuther,â€ù â€œInadmissable Evidenceâ€ù â€” all depend on a central character whose anger, grief and ridicule canâ€™t be shut up. Similarly in life, Osborne didnâ€™t know where to stop. He enjoyed articulating grievance and seized any excuse to manufacture it. He had a vicious self-pity. In the words of the director Peter Hall, â€œWhen he had a pen in his hand it was like giving a kid a machine gun.â€ù To Hall (and several others) he was â€œa charmer, a sweetheartâ€ù as well as â€œa bastard and a liarâ€ù and worse.,In the 1950s and â€™60s he was also easily Britainâ€™s best-known playwright. He grew rich â€” as co-producer and Oscar-winning screenwriter of Tony Richardsonâ€™s â€œTom Jonesâ€ù (1963), he earned more money than he knew what to do with. He bought a house in Belgravia and a Bentley, employed secretaries, servants and chauffeurs. By the 1970s, he was swallowing one bottle of vodka and a couple of bottles of wine every day, along with unreckonable amounts of Champagne and codeine and amphetamine. He never again wrote anything so good or popular as the four plays mentioned above, the last of them finished in 1964, and spent his last years in a big house near the hilly Welsh border, struggling with bad health and debts.,He died just after his 65th birthday, on Christmas Eve 1994, and was buried in his Turnbull & Asser smoking jacket with his old copy of â€œHamletâ€ù stuffed in a pocket. (It had every part crossed out except Hamletâ€™s.) He died a club man, an Anglican, a country gentleman, a collector of teddy bears. Not the world he was born into, or that which his early work seemed to inveigh against, but a vanishing world that Osborne identified as England. Only those who had missed the nostalgia in â€œLook Back in Angerâ€ù saw him as a sellout. As Jimmy Porter says of the remnants of Edwardian England in 1956, â€œif youâ€™ve no world of your own, itâ€™s rather pleasant to regret the passing of someone elseâ€™s.â€ù",IAN JACK,"JAN. 28, 2007",Coming-of-Rage,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Jack.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON, dashed to Iowa this weekend to hang an open-for-business sign on her new campaign operation. , is besieged by admirers begging to join his team.

Polk went to the Democratic convention in 1844 and became the presidential nominee by accident after the favorite, former President Martin Van Buren, lost Southern support.,But perhaps more than any other presidential contest, 2008â€™s could help determine whether the dark horse, a term borrowed from English racetrack lingo, is on the verge of extinction, particularly since the entry fee in the race for the White House has been raised yet again.,For the first time since 1928, neither a sitting president nor vice president will be a candidate in the race, theoretically creating a wide-open fight for both nominations and making it possible for a dark horse to pull stealthily ahead. But the contest is front-loaded as never before â€” California and other big states are rushing to wedge their caucuses and primaries into early February â€” so little-known candidates concede they have an even more difficult task.,Already, the leading contenders are making plans to reject public financing in the primary and general election campaigns for the first time since Watergate. The cost of preparing for a race, strategists believe, could swell beyond $75 million this year alone, which most dark horse candidates may struggle to meet, given the calendar.,â€œIt makes it almost impossible for a dark horse to win,â€ù said Dayton Duncan, who worked on the 1984 and 1988 Democratic presidential races of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis and wrote â€œGrass Roots: One Year in the Life of the New Hampshire Presidential Primary.â€ù â€œBut it might be the only chance for a dark horse candidate if they really caught lightning in a jar and were catapulted to the national stage.â€ù,The window will be narrow for a second-tier candidate. With rapid back-to-back primaries, a promising showing in Iowa or New Hampshire is critical to advancing.,But even before the rules and the calendar take shape for the 2008 race, dark horse candidates have one piece of storybook history to hold onto: ,, 1976.,After Mr. Carter declared his candidacy on Dec. 12, 1974, a Harris poll listed 35 prospective presidential candidates. Mr. Carter, a one-term Georgia governor, was not among them. Yet 13 months later, after spending day after day traipsing from the Missouri to the Mississippi, he won the Iowa caucuses, that all-important first test of a candidacy. The victory replenished his bank account and sustained him through the rest of the primary campaign.,But now, with the campaignâ€™s cost significantly higher and less time to raise money and attract supporters between primaries, it is hard to imagine a candidateâ€™s emerging from the shadows on persistence alone.,â€œWithout a doubt, itâ€™s more difficult for someone to emerge today since youâ€™ve got people who can raise tens of millions of dollars at the drop of a hat,â€ù said Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, who as a young congressman watched the 1976 campaign with interest. â€œLittle guys like Carter could never compete with that.â€ù,The Iowa caucuses not only created the lore of Mr. Carter, but Mr. Carter added to the lore of the Iowa caucuses. And for the last three decades, his out-of-nowhere victory has lured ambitious politicians convinced that they, too, could pull off the  feat.,In 2004, the brief  rise of Howard Dean again illustrated that little-known candidates could catch fire and raise money to compete with candidates blessed by the political establishment, but it also reinforced  Iowaâ€™s importance. He finished third, his chances to become the nominee collapsing.,Mr. Dean tapped into the promise of the Internet like no other. And the next evolution of Internet fund-raising and activism â€” combined with old-fashioned discipline â€” might resuscitate the dark horse.,â€œThe Internet can spontaneously combust a dark-horse candidacy that can take everyone out,â€ù said Joe Trippi, who managed Mr. Deanâ€™s campaign. â€œEverybody is sure itâ€™s going to be Hillary, Edwards or Obama, but my guess is that someone no one is talking about right now is going to give these three the scare of their life.â€ù,The Internet could be the great equalizer. First, candidates who struggle to raise money through traditional means could tap into the grassroots to close the gap. Second, if a front-runnerâ€™s stumble is caught on camera it is sure to be widely disseminated on YouTube and its ilk, which could clear a path for an outsider.,With the rush of candidates announcing their bids in the last few weeks, you could  almost forget that the first primary votes wonâ€™t be cast for another year. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are among the hopefuls whose high profile will deny them the advantage of learning on the fly, a privilege reserved for the dark horse. If, for example, former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa missteps, he might be able to pick himself up without attracting as much notice as one of his more prominent rivals.,â€œA lot can change in a month,â€ù said Senator Tom Harkin, also of Iowa, who in 1992 sought the Democratic presidential nomination. â€œOne of the problems of being a front-runner like Hillary and Barack, if they make a mistake, it will be magnified way beyond its own dimensions. If others stumble, itâ€™s not a big deal.â€ù,As he left the Senate floor to begin a weekend of campaigning, Sam Brownback of Kansas, one of many Republican candidates in the field, stopped for a moment to chat about his prospects. After describing himself as the â€œtrue conservative in the field,â€ù he acknowledged finding solace in the legends of Democratic dark horses.,â€œYou have people like Jimmy Carter, who came out of nowhere. And Bill Clinton! They were not household names when they started this process,â€ù Mr. Brownback said. Asked when he was heading to Iowa, he paused for barely a beat and replied, â€œNext week.â€ù",JEFF ZELENY,"JAN. 28, 2007",The Faint Hoofbeats?

"FIFTEEN years ago, Roy Brown, a hard-drinking man with a criminal record, was convicted of stabbing, beating, biting and strangling a social worker in upstate New York. The case rested largely on one piece of forensic evidence: bite marks on the victimâ€™s body that the prosecutionâ€™s witness, a local dentist, said matched Mr. Brownâ€™s teeth.,On Tuesday, Mr. Brown was released from prison, after DNA testing on the saliva left by the biter proved his innocence and implicated someone else in the crime. At the time of his conviction, Mr. Brown, 46, was missing two front teeth. The bite marks, meanwhile, had six tooth imprints.,The prosecutionâ€™s expert testified that Mr. Brown could have twisted the victimâ€™s skin to fill the gaps his missing teeth would have left on the bite mark. Despite rebuttal from the defense, whose expert said the bite marks excluded Mr. Brown, it took jurors five hours to return a guilty verdict.,What happened to Mr. Brown is hardly an aberration. Prosecutors have invoked bite-mark matches to secure convictions in numerous cases, only to see these convictions overturned when DNA or other evidence has become available.,In spite of the evolution of other forensic sciences, bite-mark analysis remains an inexact tool. A 1999 study by a member of the American Board of Forensic Odontology, a professional trade organization, found a 63 percent rate of false identifications.,Why is it, then, that bite-mark analysis remains part of the forensic arsenal? There is, experts say, a mix of ignorance on the part of jurors and defense lawyers about the evidenceâ€™s scientific shortcomings and the overzealousness of prosecutors and their expert witnesses, who are seen as too quick to validate an unproven technique.,As the pace of overturned convictions increases, however, the courts are growing more skeptical of the absolute conclusions drawn by bite-mark experts and, in turn, are becoming more receptive when defense lawyers rebut the analysis.,Lawyers, for their part, are taking steps to counter what they call the â€œC.S.I. effect,â€ù when juries become overly impressed by forensic evidence. During jury selection, it is not uncommon for them to ask potential jurors about their television-watching preferences to weed out those who seem unable to separate fact from fiction.,The key, experts say, is for lawyers to know enough about the subjective components of bite-mark analysis to refute it effectively in court.,â€œIf you say that this bite fits this person and nobody else in the world, and if you use the bite mark as the only piece of physical evidence linking an attacker to his victim, thatâ€™s not science â€” thatâ€™s junk,â€ù said Dr. Richard Souviron, chief forensic odontologist at the Miami-Dade Medical Examinerâ€™s Office.,As people age, Dr. Souviron said, their jaws expand, changing the position of their teeth. Teeth can be chipped, broken or just pulled out; skin shifts when it is bitten. And, one must ask, was the victim moving? If the bite was on the chest, was the arm stretched above the head or resting next to the torso?,â€œThere are just too many variables,â€ù said Dr. C. Michael Bowers, author of â€œForensics Dental Evidence: An Investigatorâ€™s Handbook,â€ù published in 2004.,And there is also what David L. Faigman, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, calls the â€œcontext effect.â€ù Because most forensic scientists learn a lot about the suspect before analyzing the bite mark, â€œitâ€™s easy for them to see what they are expected to see,â€ù Mr. Faigman said.,Experts, he added, â€œcan basically be prepped to see a match.â€ù,Bite marks, however, can be helpful in excluding someone as a suspect, or determining that the suspect could be the one who inflicted the bite, many experts and defense lawyers agree.,â€œIf you limit bite-mark analysis to its accepted validity, itâ€™s not inappropriate for an expert to say that a certain suspect is not the biter,â€ù said Christopher Plourd, a lawyer in San Diego who has represented several suspects whose trials revolved around bite-mark evidence. â€œBut thatâ€™s as far as you should go.â€ù,In 1995, forensic odontologists moved to avoid using the term â€œmatchâ€ù in their analysis, so as to avoid giving the impression that the bite mark belongs to a specific suspect and no one else. But similar, if nuanced, phrases still find their way into court, causing confusion. The courts, however, do not have guidelines restricting the use or presentation of bite-mark analysis.,â€œI feel very strongly that if the courts were a little bit more vigilant or perhaps simply a little bit more informed that they would come very close to excluding a lot of this evidence,â€ù Mr. Faigman said. â€œOr, at the very least, they would tell that the evidence could come in, but for very modest purposes.â€ù",FERNANDA SANTOS,"JAN. 28, 2007","Evidence From Bite Marks, It Turns Out, Is Not So Elementary",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/weekinreview/28santos.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"SEATTLE, Jan. 27 (AP) â€” A bridge in Seattle is becoming hazardous to the mental health of the office workers below, who keep seeing people jump to their deaths.,Thirty-nine people over the past decade have committed suicide off the 155-foot-high Aurora Bridge â€” eight in 2006 alone â€” and counselors are regularly brought in to help office workers deal with the shock of seeing the leap or the aftermath.,City and state officials are adding suicide-prevention signs and telephones in hopes of reducing the death toll.,The bridge, built in 1931, carries up to 45,000 vehicles a day on one of the main north-south highways through Seattle, passing over a narrow ship channel to Lakes Union and  Washington.,Some jumpers hit the water; others land on the pavement or other solid ground. Either way, they almost always die.,The area under the bridge used to be filled with docks and warehouses, and the suicides went largely unnoticed. But in the technology boom of the past two decades, it changed into a trendy area of office buildings, shops and restaurants, and people began to see the bodies fall.,â€œThey end up in our parking lot,â€ù said Katie Scharer, who works at Cutter & Buck, a sportswear company. â€œNobodyâ€™s ever totally used to it.â€ù,Grief counselors visited Cutter & Buck as recently as a month ago.,A few weeks ago, officials installed six emergency phones and 18 signs that give the number of a 24-hour crisis line in bold yellow type.,â€œAny time you can interrupt a suicide thought process, you have a good chance of success, at least temporarily,â€ù said L. J. Eddy, who leads the police hostage negotiation team.,Transportation officials said installing nets or raising the sides of the bridge could interfere with safety inspections and could catch the wind, making the bridge dangerously unstable. Any plans to alter the bridge would have to go through a public approval process because it is a national historic landmark.,Few suicides occur on Seattleâ€™s other major bridges â€” the Ship Canal Bridge, which carries Interstate 5, and the West Seattle Bridge â€” because they are closed to pedestrians.,The Aurora Bridge serves as a pedestrian link between two densely populated hilltops.

"In the wake of the 2004 tsunami that devastated shorelines around the Indian Ocean, the relief group , won plaudits for its decision to halt fund-raising for the disaster once it had collected enough donations to accomplish the mission it had set for itself.,Other relief organizations raised as much as they could and consequently faced criticism from French and British regulators and others for being unable to spend all of it expediently.,Doctors Without Borders, a French medical charity, has long practiced an unusual form of discipline that may cause other nonprofits to squirm. For more than a decade, it has politely declined financial support from corporations whose activities conflict with its mission and principles, recently adding some medical device makers and biotechnology companies.,It even declines money such companies make to match donations from their employees. â€œWeâ€™re not making moral judgments,â€ù said Alyssa Herman, director of development at the organizationâ€™s New York affiliate. â€œThe policy is really an effort to avoid potential conflicts or barriers to our mission.â€ù,Nonprofit circles have been buzzing lately over a two-part series in The Los Angeles Times highlighting conflicts between the goals of the Gates Foundation and the activities of some companies in which it invests.,Foundations and charities have long confronted such questions. A few years ago, some museums and other organizations were fighting questions over their acceptance of donations made by corporate leaders tainted by scandals, like L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Tyco International executive who gave millions to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Kenneth L. Lay, the Enron founder, whose name adorned facilities and programs in Houston and Aspen, Colo.,Doctors Without Borders is not alone, though its policy may be the most stringent. Last year, the American Diabetes Association adopted a tougher policy to govern its relationship with food and drug companies, and many charities prohibit the acceptance of gifts from tobacco companies and their subsidiaries.,Critics note, though, that beyond tobacco, such policies are usually nuanced. The American Heart Association, for instance, does not allow wine and alcohol companies to use its brand for marketing and image-building purposes, but it will accept money raised on its behalf through wine auctions and tastings.,Similarly, it does not allow the use of its name or logo by candy and chocolate makers but will accept money from them â€œas long as no strings are attached,â€ù said David Livingston, the heart associationâ€™s corporate secretary and counsel.,About 18 percent of the associationâ€™s revenues in the year that ended June 30, 2006, came from companies, compared with about 7 percent of the $122 million the American unit of Doctors Without Borders raised in 2005.,â€œCorporations are not per se bad,â€ù Mr. Livingston said. â€œThey have different interests than we do, but where our interests overlap and where doing so would not have an impact on our integrity and credibility, we think itâ€™s appropriate to work with them on behalf of what we do.â€ù,As the number of charities rises at a much faster pace than giving, it is difficult for any nonprofit group to look a gift horse in the mouth. â€œItâ€™s a very thorny subject,â€ù said Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of the Independent Sector, a trade association representing about 550 nonprofit organizations. â€œWhere do you draw the line? Some of our largest foundations were created by individuals who have been described as robber barons. Should charities look askance at that money?â€ù,Rushworth M. Kidder, president of the Institute for Global Ethics, said he did not think a blanket prohibition on gifts from corporations was necessary but that charities should be thinking more about the issue. â€œWeâ€™re a nonprofit, and we have drawn the line, for instance, with some foundations that are clearly aligned with a political position,â€ù he said. â€œWeâ€™re here to help people understand how to think, not what to think, and to the extent that people see us as coming from a particular position because of the money we receive, it dilutes out mission.â€ù,The Doctors Without Borders policy has existed informally since the early 1990s, Ms. Herman said, and was formally approved by the board later that decade. The organization does not solicit or accept funds from any companies or their foundations that derive income from tobacco, alcohol, weapons, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, biotechnology, oil, mineral, gas and other extractive industries, like diamond mining.,â€œTo take money from an economic entity whose influence goes beyond the economic to influence politics and government in the areas where we work could complicate the negotiations we have with governments, rebel groups and others,â€ù said Nicolas de TorrentÃ©, executive director of the Doctors Without Borders affiliate in the United States.,Mr. de TorrentÃ© noted, for example, the far-reaching influence of diamond mining in Western Africa, and of the oil industry in Nigeria and Sudan. â€œYouâ€™ll often hear of oil companies trying to set up clinics, but we are there just to do humanitarian work, not to promote or help anyone with their image,â€ù Mr. de TorrentÃ© said.",STEPHANIE STROM,"JAN. 28, 2007",Nonprofit Groups Draw a Line at Some Donors,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/us/28charity.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MANCHESTER, N. H., Jan. 27 â€” , sounded nearer than ever to being a presidential candidate on Saturday, repeatedly talking about the prospect of running, and inviting  voters to judge him by his record as mayor of New York City.,Though he has long been thought to be a presidential contender, he has fallen behind other candidates in declaring his intention, and the language he used on Saturday, while suggesting a run, also contained built-in escape hatches. Speaking to a convention of the , ,, he advised the delegates on â€œwhat you should look for in whatever decision you make in presidential primaries,â€ù and added, â€œwhen I promise you things, if I do, when I do, as I do, Iâ€™ll promise them because Iâ€™ve done them before.â€ù,He returned to that theme moments later, and as he has done in recent days, drew a direct analogy between fighting crime in his home city and establishing peace in Iraq.,â€œWhen I say to you that we should reduce taxes to stimulate the economy, Iâ€™ll say it to you because I did it and I saw it work,â€ù he said. â€œWhen I say we have to bring peace and security as sort of the beginning of anything, whether itâ€™s in Baghdad or in other parts of the world or here at home, Iâ€™ll say that to you because I saw that happen in New York, and I made it happen.

He has raised money, traveled extensively and put together a more robust organization in recent weeks, but as other candidates enter the race, many Republicans â€” and some publications â€” have questioned whether he will go through with it.,On this trip, he met privately with several elected officials, including the mayor of Manchester, Frank Guinta â€” the kind of personal courting people here expect, and that other top contenders have done more than Mr. Giuliani has. â€œHeâ€™s going to have to spend a lot more with these people,â€ù said Senator John E. Sununu.,When he speaks, Mr. Giuliani normally walks around the stage and does not refer to notes, joking and making matter-of-fact arguments. But Saturdayâ€™s speech, at the old Palace Theater, was unusually formal for him  â€” he stayed behind the lectern and worked from notes â€” and also more overtly boastful and partisan, and more designed to rouse his audience.,Mr. Giuliani has taken the politically risky position of supporting President Bushâ€™s unpopular decision to send more troops to Iraq, as have the other Republicans who rank highest in early polls, Senator John S. McCain and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. But for the second time in as many days, Mr. Giuliani cautioned Saturday that the strategy might not work, and that it should not be viewed as the last word in the war.,â€œWe hope and we root for and we pray for a successful outcome in Iraq,â€ù he said. â€œBut our ultimate victory is not going to be a military victory. Our ultimate victory against terrorism is going to be a victory of ideas.â€ù,But he stayed away from the divisive social issues that put him at odds with much of his party, like his support of , rights and gay civil unions. Some delegates here said they had hoped Mr. Giuliani would explain support his past support for gun controls in New York that would be unpopular here.,Still, Republican officials here take him very seriously as a presidential contender, based primarily on his reputation for leadership in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.,â€œI would say his chances are excellent,â€ù said State Representative John Reagan. â€œEveryone knows he has been severely tested.â€ù",RICHARD PÃ‰REZ-PEÃ‘A,"JAN. 28, 2007",Giuliani Is Sounding More Like a Candidate,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/us/politics/28giuliani.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 27  â€” More than a year after a virulent strain of , killed 52 of 53 infected patients in a rural South African hospital, experts here and abroad say the disease has most likely spread to neighboring countries, and some say urgent action is essential to halt its advance.,Several expressed concern at what they called ,â€™s sluggish response to a health emergency that, left unchecked, could prove hugely expensive to contain and could threaten millions across sub-Saharan Africa.,The director of the governmentâ€™s tuberculosis programs called those concerns unfounded and said officials were doing everything reasonable to combat the outbreak.,The form of TB, known as XDR for extensively drug-resistant, cannot be effectively treated with most first- and second-line tuberculosis drugs, and some doctors consider it incurable.,Since it was first detected last year in KwaZulu-Natal Province, bordering the Indian Ocean, additional cases have been found at 39 hospitals in South Africaâ€™s other eight provinces. In interviews on Friday, several epidemiologists and TB experts said the disease had probably moved into Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique â€” countries that share borders and migrant work forces with South Africa â€” and perhaps to Zimbabwe, which sends hundreds of thousands of destitute refugees to and from South Africa each year.,But no one can say with certainty, because none of those countries have  the laboratories and clinical experts necessary to diagnose and track the disease. Ominously, none have the money and skills that would be needed to contain it should it begin to spread.,Even in South Africa, where nearly 330 cases have been officially documented, evidence of the diseaseâ€™s spread is mostly anecdotal, and epidemiological work needed to trace its progress is only now beginning.,â€œWe donâ€™t understand the extent of it, and whether itâ€™s more widespread than anyone thinks,â€ù Mario C. Raviglione, the director of the Stop TB Department of the World Health Organization in Geneva, said in a telephone interview. â€œAnd if we donâ€™t know what has caused it, then we donâ€™t know how to stop it.â€ù,Cases of XDR TB exist elsewhere, in countries like Russia and China where inadequate treatment programs have allowed drug-resistant strains of the disease to emerge. The South African outbreak is considered far more alarming than those elsewhere, however, because it is not only far larger, but has surfaced at the center of the worldâ€™s , pandemic.,Although one third of the worldâ€™s people, by W.H.O. estimates, are infected with dormant tuberculosis germs, the disease thrives when immune systems are weakened by H.I.V. At least two in three South African TB sufferers are H.I.V. positive. Should XDR TB gain a foothold in the H.I.V.-positive population, it could wreak havoc not only among the five million South Africans who carry the virus, but the tens of millions more throughout sub-Saharan Africa.,People without H.I.V. have a far smaller chance of contracting tuberculosis, even if they are infected with the bacillus that causes TB. But because tuberculosis is spread through the air, anyone in close contact with an active TB sufferer is at some risk of falling ill.,Most if not all of the 52 people who died in the initial outbreak of XDR TB, at the Church of Scotland Hospital in a KwaZulu-Natal hamlet called Tugela Ferry in 2005 and early 2006, had AIDS. Most died within weeks of being tested for drug-resistant tuberculosis, a mortality rate scientists called unprecedented.,Since then, South African health officials say, they have confirmed a total of 328 cases of XDR TB, all but 43 in KwaZulu-Natal. Slightly more than half the patients have died.,Those numbers are deceptive, however. The Tugela Ferry outbreak was reported in part because the hospital there was part of a Yale University research project involving H.I.V.-positive patients with tuberculosis. Because South Africaâ€™s treatment and reporting programs for tuberculosis are notoriously poor â€” barely half of TB patients are cured â€” virtually all experts contend the true rate of infection is greater.,â€œWeâ€™re really concerned that there may be similar outbreaks to the one in Tugela Ferry that are currently going undetected because the patients die very quickly,â€ù said Dr. Karin  Weyer, who directs tuberculosis programs for South Africaâ€™s Medical Research Council, a semiofficial research arm of the government.,Some other researchers and experts say they share Dr. Weyerâ€™s concern. They say South African health officials have lagged badly in assembling the epidemiological studies, treatment programs and skilled clinicians needed to combat the outbreak, and say the government has responded slowly to international offers of help.,Dr. Weyer said the council â€œshares the concern that not enough is being done, quickly enough, to get on top of the problem.â€ù In particular, she said, officials have yet to carry out epidemiological studies or address a â€œshockingâ€ù  lack of infection controls in  hospitals that could allow TB and other infections to spread freely among H.I.V.-positive patients,â€œItâ€™s an emergency, and weâ€™re not reacting as if it were an emergency,â€ù said Dr. Nesri Padayatchi,  an epidemiologist and expert on drug-resistant TB for Caprisa, a Durban-based consortium of South African and American AIDS researchers. â€œI think we have the financial resources to address the issue, and weâ€™ve been told the Department of Health has allocated these resources.â€ù,Although the government was first told of the outbreak 20 months ago, in May 2005, â€œto date, on the ground in clinics and hospitals, we are not seeing the effect,â€ù she said.,In KwaZulu-Natalâ€™s major city, Durban, the sole hospital capable of treating XDR TB patients has a waiting list of 70 such cases, she said.,Dr. Weyer said the waiting list indicates that â€œcapacity is becoming a problemâ€ù in KwaZulu-Natal, the outbreakâ€™s center.  â€œIâ€™m quite sure we may find a similar situation in other provinces,â€ù she added.,A spokesman at the hospital said it could not easily determine how many patients were awaiting treatment.,But the manager of South Africaâ€™s national tuberculosis program, Dr. Lindiwe Mvusi,  said such complaints were misplaced. The Durban hospital in question, she said, is under renovation, and officials are â€œlooking for accommodations in other hospitalsâ€ù while construction proceeds.,Hospitals in other provinces have enough beds now for XDR TB patients, and some are expanding isolation wards to handle any spread of the disease, she said.,She said other responses to the outbreak were under way, including a rough assessment of TB cases in hospitals nationwide.  A more comprehensive national survey of TB cases may be conducted late this year, she added, and health officials in KwaZulu-Natal have begun surveillance programs to detect new cases of drug-resistant TB in the province.,Dr. Mvusi also rejected the notion that the tuberculosis had moved beyond South Africaâ€™s borders. But in interviews, a number of TB experts and epidemiologists raised that concern, including Mr. Raviglione at the world health organization, Dr. Padayatchi, Dr. Weyer and Dr. Gerald Friedland, director of the AIDS program at the Yale University School of Medicine.,Dr. Raviglione of W.H.O. said that South African health officials were cooperating on responses to the outbreak, and that an official of his organization would arrive in Pretoria within days to discuss placing a team of global TB experts in the country.,â€œW.H.O. is ready to come to South Africa and to help in any place, for anything, whether surveillance, or detection, or infection control,â€ù he said. However, those arrangements have not been completed.,Dr. Mvusi, the governmentâ€™s TB program head, said  global health experts were welcome, but â€œin an advisory role, because we want the capacity locally.â€ù",MICHAEL WINES,"JAN. 28, 2007",Virulent TB in South Africa May Imperil Millions,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/world/africa/28tuberculosis.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Representative , and a number of city officials urged President Bush yesterday to reconsider  a proposed change to Medicaid that could cost the cityâ€™s public hospital network millions of dollars in annual financing.,â€œWe want to make sure the president knows how damaging his health care proposal will be to our Health and Hospitals Corporation,â€ù the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said,  referring to the agency that runs the cityâ€™s 11 public hospitals and dozens of diagnostic centers and health clinics.,Agency officials estimate the presidentâ€™s plan would cost the corporation about $350 million a year, about 7 percent of its annual budget.,Ms. Quinn joined Mr. Rangel and more than a dozen other elected officials and health care representatives at City Hall yesterday to protest the presidentâ€™s proposal.,â€œIsnâ€™t it embarrassing we have to do this,â€ù said Mr. Rangel, who promised to join other Democrats and use his post as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee to cut off funds to the presidentâ€™s health care plans.,â€œHow can a great nation like ours explain that we canâ€™t take care of our own,â€ù he said, adding that the presidentâ€™s proposals come as â€œmillions are being spent on a war that nobody wants.â€ù,Mr. Bushâ€™s proposal would end a longstanding regulation that allowed public hospitals to receive more money from Medicaid, the health plan for the poor, than private hospitals receive for the same services.,Federal officials have said that  the resulting savings could be sent to the states in the form of â€œaffordable choice grantsâ€ù and used to provide the uninsured with  private health insurance.,Alan D.

"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 23 â€” The peers who elected , as the first black president of the , Law Review say he was a natural leader, an impressive student, a nice guy. But in the 1990  Revue â€” the graduating editorsâ€™ gleeful parody of their elite publication â€” they said quite a bit more.,â€œI was born in Oslo, Norway, the son of a Volvo factory worker and part-time ice fisherman,â€ù a mock self-tribute begins. â€œMy mother was a backup singer for Abba. They were good folks.â€ù In Chicago, â€œI discovered I was black, and I have remained so ever since.â€ù,After his election, the Faux-bama says, he united warring students into â€œa happy, cohesive folk,â€ù while â€œempowering all the folks out there in America who didnâ€™t know about me by giving a series of articulate and startlingly mature interviews to all the folks in the media.â€ù,In his two memoirs and the biographical video on his Web site, Senator Obamaâ€™s legal education is barely a blip, one of the least known chapters of his life. But for the Illinois Democrat who is all but certainly running for the presidency, Harvard was the place where he first became a political sensation.,He arrived there as an unknown, Afro-wearing community organizer who had spent years searching for his identity; by the time he left, he had his first national news media exposure, a book contract and a shot of confidence from running the most powerful legal journal in the country.,As the ribbing in the Revue suggests, Mr. Obama was realizing the power of his own biography. He proved deft at navigating an institution scorched with ideological battles, many of which revolved around race. He developed a leadership style based more on furthering consensus than on imposing his own ideas. Surrounded by students who enjoyed the sound of their own voices, Mr. Obama cast himself as an eager listener, sometimes giving warring classmates the impression that he agreed with all of them at once.,Friends say he did not want anyone to assume they knew his mind â€” and because of that, even those close to him did not always know exactly where he stood. It is a tendency that could prove perilous on the campaign trail, as voters, rivals and the news media try to fix the positions of a senator with only two years in office.,â€œHe then and now is very hard to pin down,â€ù said Kenneth Mack, a classmate and now a professor at the law school, referring to the senatorâ€™s on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand style.,Charles J. Ogletree Jr., another Harvard law professor and a mentor of Mr. Obama, said, â€œHe can enter your space and organize your thoughts without necessarily revealing his own concerns and conflicts.â€ù,Many of his former professors and classmates say they are cheering on Mr. Obama, 45,  in his candidacy. But the skills he displayed in law school may not serve him as well in American presidential politics, which sometimes rewards other qualities â€” like delivering sound bites instead of deliberateness or fidelity to a base of supporters instead of compromise.,The law review is â€œfairly disconnected from the breadth and the rough and tumble of real politics,â€ù said Bruce Spiva, a former review editor who now practices civil rights law in Washington. â€œItâ€™s an election among a closed group. Itâ€™s more like electing a pope.â€ù,Mr. Obama declined to comment about his time at Harvard. He arrived at the law school in 1988 with a well-inked passport â€” he had grown up in Hawaii and Indonesia, son of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother â€” and years of community organizing experience in Chicago, making him, at 27, an elder statesman among the students who had tested and term-papered their way straight there.,Mr. Obama spent much of his time alone, curtailing his dating life after his first summer, when he met his future wife, a Harvard Law graduate named Michelle Robinson who was working in Chicago. He often played pickup basketball, replacing his deliberative off-court style with sharp elbows and aggressive grabs for the ball.,Along with 40-odd classmates, he won a precious spot on the law review at the end of his first year through grades and a writing competition. But the next year, when other students implored him to run for the presidency, he demurred; he wanted to return to community work in Chicago, he said, and the credential would be no help. Late in the process, he finally agreed, saying he might be uniquely able to heal the reviewâ€™s partisan divisions.,The election was an all-day affair with the ego-crushing drama of a reality TV show. Inside Pound Hall, the editors picked apart the intellectual and social skills of the 19 contenders, eliminating them in batches. At the last moment, the conservative faction, its initial candidates defeated, threw its support to Mr. Obama. â€œWhatever his politics, we felt he would give us a fair shake,â€ù said Bradford Berenson, a former associate White House counsel in the Bush administration.,The two finalists were invited back into the room. But before the winner could be announced, Mr. Mack, a black student who had rejoined the editors after being eliminated, lunged toward Mr. Obama, so moved by the barrier that had just fallen that he embraced him tightly, tears streaming down both menâ€™s cheeks.,Newspapers and magazines swarmed around the first black student to win the most coveted spot at the most vaunted club at one of Americaâ€™s most prestigious institutions. In interviews, Mr. Obama was modest and careful. (In a rare slip, he told The Associated Press: â€œIâ€™m not interested in the suburbs. The suburbs bore me.â€ù) He signed a contract to write a memoir. A prankster posted a cast list for a movie version of his life, starring Blair Underwood. When Mr. Underwood visited the school, he questioned Mr. Obama for material for  â€œL.A. Law.â€ù,â€œPeople were always asking me, do young black attorneys really exist like that?â€ù Mr. Underwood said in a recent interview. â€œI would refer to Barack.â€ù,Winning the job was simpler than doing it. The president had to reject articles by some of the schoolâ€™s famous professors and persuade a divided group of editors to stop arguing and start editing.,â€œI have worked in the Supreme Court and the White House and I never saw politics as bitter as at Harvard Law Review in the early â€™90s,â€ù Mr. Berenson said. â€œThe law school was populated by a bunch of would-be Daniel Websters harnessed to extreme political ideologies.â€ù They  were so ardent that they would boo and hiss one another in class.,Even trickier, Mr. Obama was the most prominent minority student on a campus shaken by racial politics. A group agitating for greater faculty diversity occupied the deanâ€™s office and sued the school for discrimination; Derrick Bell, a black law professor, resigned over the issue.,The law review struggled to decide whether affirmative action should factor into the selection of editors, and how much voice to give to critical race theorists, who argued that the legal system was inherently biased against minorities. That drew the ridicule of conservative students.,And it left the new president with a difficult choice. If he failed to use his office to criticize Harvard, Mr. Obama would anger black and liberal students; by speaking out, he would risk dragging himself and the review into the center of shrill debates.,People had a way of hearing what they wanted in Mr. Obamaâ€™s words. Earlier, after a long, tortured discussion about whether it was better to be called â€œblackâ€ù or â€œAfrican-American,â€ù Mr. Obama dismissed the question, saying semantics did not matter as much as real-life issues, recalled Cassandra Butts, still a close friend. According to Mr. Ogletree, students on each side of the debate thought he was endorsing their side. â€œEveryone was nodding, Oh, he agrees with me,â€ù he said.,As the president of the review, Mr. Obama once again walked a delicate line. He served on the board of the Black Law Students Association, often speaking passionately about the tempest of the week, but in a way that white classmates say made them feel reassured rather than defensive. He distanced himself from bombast; he did a mischievous impersonation of the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he  came to speak on campus,  recalled Franklin Amanat, now a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. Mr. Obamaâ€™s boldest moment came at a rally for faculty diversity, where he compared Professor Bell to Rosa Parks.,But mainly, Mr. Obama stayed away from the extremes of campus debate, often choosing safe topics for his speeches. At the black law studentsâ€™  annual conference, he exhorted students to remember the obligations that came with their privileged education. His speeches, delivered in the oratorical manner of a Baptist minister, were more memorable for style than substance, Mr. Mack said.,â€œItâ€™s the inspiration of the speech rather than the specific content,â€ù he said.,Just as he does now that he is a senator, Mr. Obama spoke then about his own biography â€” initially, Mr. Ogletree said, to correct anyone who assumed he had acquired his position with ease. His message, Mr. Ogletree said, was, â€œDonâ€™t look at my success and assume that I have had a silver spoon in my mouth and gold coins in my hand.â€ù,During the constant arguments about race and merit, everyone could point to Mr. Obama and find justification for their views. He had acknowledged benefiting from affirmative action in the past, so those who supported it saw him as the happy product of their beliefs.,But those who opposed it saw his presidency as the triumph of meritocracy. He was a black man who had helped one of Harvardâ€™s most celebrated professors, Laurence H. Tribe, with an article on law and physics, and would graduate magna cum laude.,Another of Mr. Obamaâ€™s techniques relied on his seemingly limitless appetite for hearing the opinions of others, no matter how redundant or extreme. That could lead to endless debates â€” a mouse infestation at the review office provoked a long exchange about rodent rights â€” as well as some uncertainty about what Mr. Obama himself thought about the issue at hand.,In dozens of interviews, his friends said they could not remember his specific views from that era, beyond a general emphasis on diversity and social and economic justice.,Instead, they wonder how the style of leadership they observed on campus could translate to another kind of historic presidency.,â€œThe things that make law school politics fractious are different from the things that make American  politics fractious,â€ù said Ron Klain, who preceded Mr. Obama at the  law review and later served as Vice President Al Goreâ€™s chief of staff. Mr. Klain has watched the senatorâ€™s rise.,â€œThe interesting caveat,â€ù he said, â€œis that is a style of leadership more effective running a law review than running a country.â€ù",JODI KANTOR,"JAN. 28, 2007","In Law School, Obama Found Political Voice",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/us/politics/28obama.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UNEMPLOYMENT is low and the job market is strong, according to surveys. But just where are the jobs in 2007?,As the population ages, jobs continue to go wanting in health care. And as more products and services go digital, competition for information technology workers is intense. Demand is also increasing for workers in the sales, clerical, education, financial services, accounting and customer service categories.,â€œUnemployment is at a historically low level,â€ù said Brent Rasmussen, chief operating officer at ,, an online job site that surveyed employers about where they expected to add jobs this year. â€œI think in 2007 weâ€™ll see steady growth, much more of an employee market.â€ù,And  nearly half the employers surveyed said they expected to increase initial salary offers to new employees â€” about one-sixth of those by 5 percent or more.,With baby boomers starting to retire and shortages of skilled workers in some areas, demand is expected to result in not only higher salaries, but also in more career advancement and opportunities for flexible work environments.,Mr. Rasmussen noted that  40 percent of  the more than 2,600  employers surveyed for his company by Harris Interactive  currently had job openings for which they could not find qualified candidates.,Competition is particularly fierce for nurses, with thousands of openings that paid $51,000, on average, in 2006. ,, for example, currently has about 4,000 nursing positions open.,â€œThe reality is there are more nursing positions in this country than there are qualified nurses,â€ù said Carol Maxwell, senior director of executive recruiting for Tenet, which is based in Dallas and owns 64 hospitals in 12 states.,â€œWe are trying new strategies every day to recruit and retain our employees,â€ù Ms. Maxwell said.,That means reaching out to people looking for second careers and offering training to help them refocus their skills.,Demand for health care workers stretches beyond nursing into a number of areas like pharmacology, radiology and many types of therapy, including physical and occupational. Salaries for available jobs in the field vary significantly. For example, according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, a midrange salary for a pharmacy aide is about $18,900 while a pharmacist may make more than $89,000 a year.,According to the Labor Department, the fastest-growing occupations in the next seven years will be in health and technology. The department, which makes its predictions every 10 years, projected in 2004  that the biggest growth rate would be in the  number of home health aides  â€” up  56 percent, to 974,000, by 2014. A group with much higher pay, network systems and data communications analysts, was expected to grow by  55 percent, to 357,000. Next were medical assistants, physician assistants, computer software engineers, physical therapist assistants and dental hygienists.,â€œThe fastest-growing jobs are dominated by a lot of technical level occupations that one can qualify for with limited post-secondary education,â€ù said Jon Sargent, an occupational outlook economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. â€œIn this day and age of expensive education, they represent affordable opportunities to get into a reasonably well-paying occupation in high demand.â€ù,After the technology boom and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000, information technology jobs have rebounded, and salaries are increasing along with opportunities.,â€œI get at least one call a month from a recruiter outside of my own firm trying to fill a job,â€ù said Rachelle Turner, a technical writer and trainer who works for Robert Half Technology, a recruitment and staffing firm in Menlo Park, Calif., specializing in placement of technology professionals.,â€œRight now, based on my experience, itâ€™s an employeeâ€™s market. There are more jobs than there have been in a very long time,â€ù she said. â€œPeople who are good, who have kept their skills sharp, generally donâ€™t stay available very long.â€ù,A survey conducted for Robert Half on I.T. hiring found that 16 percent of 1,400 chief information officers planned to add technical staff in the first three months of the year. Only 2 percent said they were planning to cut back.,Another Robert Half survey also found that the average starting salary for technology professionals would increase 2.8 percent in 2007, while starting pay for high-demand positions like software and Web developers is expected to climb by at least 4 percent. Salaries for chief information officers are expected to range from $120,250 to $200,000 in 2007; those for senior Web developers, from $71,000 to $102,000; and those for entry-level help desk operators, from $27,500 to $37,000.,The technology skills in greatest demand, according to the survey, were Windows administration,  followed by network administration and database management. Companies also said that Web developers and programmers were highly prized,  as well as people with network security and project management skills.,â€œWeâ€™re seeing companies investing in technology to make them better, faster and stronger,â€ù said Katherine Spencer Lee, executive director of Robert Half Technology. â€œThey need people who can help them get the technology to work.â€ù,Another high-growth area is energy, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a consulting firm. Refinery and drilling jobs have increased, he said, as have jobs in  alternative and synthetic fuels. While the overall number of added jobs  may be small when compared with other sectors, he said, the growth has been significant.,Doors are also opening for executives, said Chris Ohlendorf, a senior partner at the  McKinley Group, an executive search firm based in Minneapolis.,â€œWhatâ€™s been missing over the past few years is the ability for managers and others in leadership positions to have a productive job search,â€ù Mr. Ohlendorf said. â€œEverybody was filling soldier roles.â€ù,But recently, companies have been looking for people to manage those workers.,â€œHiring is much more aggressive, much more real,â€ù he said.,The hottest areas for executive jobs,  according to McKinley, are sales, engineering and accounting and finance (particularly for those familiar with accounting changes in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or with compliance reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission) with strong growth in marketing and information technology.  Mr. Ohlendorf said that in information technology,  there was particularly strong demand for senior-level project managers, professionals with experience in software quality assurance and Microsoftâ€™s .Net technology.,FOR college graduates in general, the job outlook is also good, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, an organization of college career advisers and staffing professionals.,A recent survey found that employers hope to hire 17.4 percent more graduates in 2007 than in 2006. Employers in the service sector predicted the largest increase,  19.8 percent, with manufacturers planning to increase hiring of graduates by 9.5 percent. For  government and nonprofit employers, the projected gain was 9 percent.,But that doesnâ€™t mean finding a job is effortless. Jonathan G. Sugar, who later this year will be graduating from a masterâ€™s program in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that pounding the pavement or, perhaps more aptly in 2007, hitting the job boards, was still crucial for graduating college students.,A recent visit to a job fair that included many of the major military  contractors was little more than a meet-and-greet, he said.,â€œAll the big companies just tell you to go online and apply,â€ù he said.  â€œI just go to the job fairs for the free pens.â€ù",BARBARA WHITAKER,"JAN. 28, 2007","From Tech Workers to Nurses, an Employeeâ€™s Market",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/business/yourmoney/28hire.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ON the surface, it seemed like the perfectly executed job search. Every day, a 40-year-old saleswoman based in New York would scan Internet job boards like Monster, HotJobs and CareerBuilder and would send e-mail messages to contacts and potential employers. She faxed her rÃ©sumÃ© and checked online trade news. In short, she did everything she could to find a more fulfilling job than the one she had held for seven years.,There was just one catch: she conducted much of her job search last year right under her employerâ€™s nose, using the companyâ€™s computer, fax machine, business e-mail account and office supplies.,â€œI was doing a lot of stuff that could have gotten me in trouble,â€ù acknowledged the saleswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was still working for the same small business. â€œMy opinion was, let them fire me. I would have been disappointed to hurt their feelings, but on the other hand I had to do what I had to do.â€ù She did erase her computerâ€™s history as often as possible to cover her tracks.,Her story is not unusual. In workplaces where high-speed broadband Internet access is typically available and 60-hour workweeks are commonplace, many employees believe that the office is the most convenient or effective place to do a job search. And people who are unhappy with their jobs sometimes believe that they are entitled to use the workplace to find something better.,There are no statistics on the extent of the practice, but according to workplace experts and employees, it is widespread. The problem is that such activity is often against company policy and may even lead to dismissal.,â€œItâ€™s something that should be avoided, particularly when company employment policies specifically forbid resources and communication devices for any personal use, much less for a job search,â€ù said Ben Dattner, principal of Dattner Consulting, a Manhattan-based firm with large and small corporate and nonprofit clients. â€œItâ€™s important to abide by the terms of oneâ€™s employment and not to burn bridges.â€ù,The chances of being caught, Mr. Dattner added, have climbed  as more companies monitor computer use and e-mail. He said that instead of using company time and property for a job search, employees could conduct the hunt on their own time with their home computers and cellphones. And it is not difficult to go to a nearby print center at lunchtime to make copies, he noted.,Noah Pickus, interim director for ethics at the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University, recommends that job seekers use common sense in their pursuit of new employment while at the office. That means not spending hours job-searching while neglecting work duties or putting the office phone number on your rÃ©sumÃ©.,â€œThere is an important distinction between an occasional e-mail and spending half a day looking for another job,â€ù Mr. Pickus said. â€œThe most difficult ethical dilemmas are often between two rights. Itâ€™s right to look out for yourself and your family and itâ€™s right that you have an obligation to your current employer.â€ù,John A. Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement firm based in Chicago, says that most employees, especially those under 40, see themselves as â€œfree agentsâ€ù who will search for jobs from their offices as a matter of course. Employees working 50- or 60-hour weeks, he said, are often too exhausted to look for jobs when they are outside the office.,He says he does believe that job-hunting from the office crosses an ethical line when employees begin using office supplies for rÃ©sumÃ©s and cover letters.,It can also be dangerous. Mr. Challenger suggested that if an employer caught an employee job-searching on company time, it could lead to a loss of â€œplum assignments and promotions.â€ù,An organization that is downsizing may be quicker to fire an employee who has been caught faxing his rÃ©sumÃ©, and occasionally it may lead to dismissal of a worker who is already on thin ice, Mr. Challenger said. Occasionally, though, it could have the opposite effect, he said â€” spurring an employer to try to reconcile differences with a disgruntled but valuable employee.,There is one situation when it may be acceptable to look for a job from the office, Mr. Challenger said: when layoffs are expected or have been announced.,That was the case for Adrienne Lewin, 34, now a freelance writer based in New Jersey who was a staff reporter for , in 2001, when the company announced major layoffs. Many of the employees to be laid off, including Ms. Lewin, remained in the companyâ€™s offices in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for about two months after the announcements and took advantage of the opportunity to use FoxNews.com resources to find another job, she said.,â€œI searched job sites from the office,â€ù Ms. Lewin said. â€œI also used the fax machine printer, copier and phone to reach journalism contacts and respond to job postings. And there was a small amount of satisfaction in using whatever I could from the employer who was letting me go, to find something better.â€ù,MS. LEWIN said she would be too nervous about getting caught to use company computers or e-mail to hunt for jobs from the office again. But she has seen it done often at other jobs she has held.,â€œIâ€™ve found job listings and rÃ©sumÃ©s resting on printers at work,â€ù Ms. Lewin said. â€œThough I havenâ€™t done it, I think people treat it like shopping online during work hours. Itâ€™s not seen as an ethical violation.â€ù,A 52-year-old hospital health care professional based in New York says she was initially torn about searching for new work from the office of an employer she has been with for 12 years. On one hand, she said, she occasionally felt guilty job-hunting from her office at lunch hour or using moments to update her rÃ©sumÃ© and to check online job boards.,On the other hand, she said the qualms she felt about looking for a new job while at work were superseded by anger toward her employers for making her feel â€œanonymous and replaceable.â€ù She believes that her talent and masterâ€™s-level education are not being utilized in her current job, she said, and that the two hours a week she spends job-hunting from the office does not affect her work.,While she is comfortable using her office computer to job-search, she said, she does not feel right sending e-mail messages to prospective employers.,Just as job-seeking from the office often requires secrecy, so can going on interviews. In 2004, Mary Catanzaro realized after just two weeks that an office-manager job she took with a New York-based fashion showroom was a mistake. Almost immediately, she began searching for another job and going on interviews. But the showroomâ€™s dress code was so casual that showing up in a work suit would have looked suspicious.,â€œWearing a blue suit was a red flag that you were interviewing,â€ù Ms. Catanzaro, now 37, recalled.  Instead, she packed her blue suit into her gym bag and changed clothes and applied makeup in a nearby McDonaldâ€™s restroom.,Ms. Catanzaro, whose current job as an office manager for a New York photography studio includes interviewing prospective employees, said that she empathized with people who look for jobs while at work. â€œIf youâ€™re not happy with a place, you donâ€™t care about protocol,â€ù she said. â€œYouâ€™re trying to go forward with your own career. Itâ€™s not necessarily ethical, but itâ€™s sometimes necessary.â€ù",DAVID KOEPPEL,"JAN. 28, 2007",The Pluses and Pitfalls of Job-Seeking at Work,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/business/yourmoney/28apply.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The (variously) one-eyed, one-horned, purple, red and green people eaters called Uglydolls are among the most successful of a new wave of vinyl, plastic and plush â€œdesigner toys.â€ù Originally conceived by the New York design school graduates David Horvath and Sun-Min Kim, the Uglydoll line has grown into a monstrous franchise with dozens of iterations, collected (ostensibly for their kids) by baby boomers, like me, who have yet to fully embrace maturity. Uglydolls are, however, but one brand among scores â€” if not hundreds â€” of patently quirky and deliberately unsightly toy/object characters that have exploded into a minor global phenomenon.,Starting in Hong Kong and Japan during the mid-1990s, when comic illustrators fiendishly began tearing off and substituting heads and appendages on G.I. Joes, Barbies and other mainstream dolls and toys with mangled (and melted) body parts, these hybrids were sold at comic-book conventions, where people went wild for them. Soon toy factories in Guangdong Province in China were commissioned to produce limited editions of around 250 each, and the â€œdesigner toy movementâ€ù erupted.,In â€œI Am Plastic: The Designer Toy Explosion,â€ù Paul Budnitz, founder of Kidrobot, one of the most prodigious retailers of designer toys in the United States, and co-creator of the Dunny doll (a balloonlike head with rounded ears atop a stumpy teddy-bear body, produced in various customized versions), showcases many of the more adventurous toy designers and their wares. While much too short on descriptive text â€” it could also have benefited from more historical analysis â€” this large, sumptuous display of alluring oddities shows the extent to which independent artists and designers have aggressively and satirically pushed the limits of convention beyond the benign world brought to life in the animated film â€œToy Story.â€ù,Small toy companies â€” with rock-band names like Secret Base, Tokyo Guns, Cube Works, Rough Toyz and the Creatures in My Head, featuring bizarre (sometimes sarcastically cute) toys by illustrators and artists like Frank Kozik, Tim Biskup, Gary Baseman, Sara Antoinette Martin and Jim Woodring â€” have since flooded art and design galleries and alternative toy stores with collectibles in a wide price range. These radical, ribald objects are influenced by all manner of pop culture genres, from the gangsta rap used in Misha & Shaunaâ€™s Missing Link to the heavy metal in Takumi Iwaseâ€™s Rock Rabbit. In the outlaw tradition, there are plenty of scurrilous defacements of corporate symbols: the artist Filth transforms Mickey Mouse into a monster mouse with Devil 666 Bear Qee; Ron Englishâ€™s MC Supersized is a stubby, bling-wearing Ronald McDonald.,Many among this new breed of toy designer were weaned on Japanese manga comics and anime films, as well as American cartoons like â€œRen & Stimpy,â€ù â€œThe Simpsonsâ€ù and â€œSouth Park.â€ù Some also emerged from the skateboard and graffiti cultures, where they were hard-wired to attack or analyze everything in mass culture. For them anything is artistically possible, especially challenging the convention-bound toy industry. Yet Budnitz notes that despite their influences, one thing is certain: these toys are not nostalgic. â€œAs far as I am concerned nostalgia is a creativity killer, and a life killer,â€ù he says. And while some toys overtly riff on TV shows and movies (like Nathan Cabreraâ€™s R2-D4, in which a can of the popular lubricant WD-40 is made to look like the body of the â€œStar Warsâ€ù character R2-D2, and his Breakfast at Tiffanyâ€™s, Starring French Kitty, featuring a sassy, wide-eyed plastic cat in Audrey Hepburnâ€™s famous cocktail dress), a vast majority are unique, conceptual comic absurdities made, more or less, from whole cloth (or fresh plastic). To-Fu Oyako, a 10-inch piece of tofu in a spaceman outfit, made by Devilrobots, and Gloomy Bear, a sad-eyed pink creature clinging to a lifeless friend named Pity, designed by Mori Chack, are among the most imaginative creatures in a book filled with many surprises.,Although designer toys emerged on the pop culture scene with a kind of D.I.Y. underground cred, most are intricately and professionally produced, with well-articulated parts and accessories. Le Messieâ€™s Zombies â€” a series of brightly colored creatures with sardonic expressions, whose bodies resemble large gel caps with arms, legs and removable heads that cover their deformed brains â€” are typical of an obsessive attention to detail. In fact, designer toys are also more sculptural than their mainstream counterparts. Even the cardboard and bubble-wrapped packages (sadly, not reproduced in the book) are graphically alluring. â€œWhat draws a person to an object is not always an idea â€” it might just be an intense love for the material reality of the object itself,â€ù Budnitz writes.,Heâ€™s right. Over the past five years Iâ€™ve bought dozens of toys, not for bathtub play but for arrangement in pristine displays (kept out of reach of my son) that are a pleasure simply to look at. â€œI Am Plasticâ€ù proves that as this art form grows, there will be many more toys worth collecting.",STEVEN HELLER,"JAN. 28, 2007",Toy Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Heller.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I recently wandered through my home library in Montana and rediscovered Karl Shapiroâ€™s â€œBourgeois Poetâ€ù (1964), a book of prose poems I first read during the vile winter of 1966. My wife and I had moved back to northern Michigan, after Iâ€™d left behind a good job in Boston on the promise of my first book of poems, â€œPlain Song,â€ù having been accepted by Norton. I donâ€™t recall what shape I expected the promise to arrive in: I ended up trimming Christmas trees and working construction for two and a half bucks an hour. Our rented house was only $35 a month, but it was drafty, the furnace was faulty and frequently the place couldnâ€™t be brought up to 55 degrees. All of these numbers can actually describe a life.,Reading Shapiroâ€™s prose poems under such conditions was wonderful in that I was decidedly not bourgeois. As a young Francophile, mostly because high school textbooks of American and English literature in the â€™50s were so dreary, I was sympathetic with the prose poem, essentially a French genre. Shapiro seemed to be deranged by the prosperity of his academic position â€” he was a professor at the University of Nebraska â€” and since I had flunked out of graduate school for reasons of arrogance I was familiar with the atmosphere he was evoking: â€œNow when I drive behind a Diesel-stinking bus / On the way to the university to teach / Stevens and Pound and MallarmÃ© / I am homesick for war.â€ù,I was empathetic to Shapiroâ€™s travails up to a point, but then my wife and I were eating altogether too much macaroni and cheap cheese and he sounded like a man who had had a huge porterhouse and half a cheesecake for dinner and was complaining about indigestion. The subtext, unworded but looming, was that, like coal miners, poets have to make a living, and Shapiro had children.,It should be remembered that bourgeois was a volatile word in the 60s, frequently an insult. After our horrid winter I ended up teaching at Stony Brook on Long Island, where I occasionally noted professors in bell-bottoms with long hair saying, â€œAll power to the people,â€ù whoever they might be. Obviously our workday clothing is also a costume signifying who we wish to be, and professors at the time could be nervous about being bourgeois. Only a Republican would wear a clean trench coat.,Shapiro (1913-2000) had gotten the title for his book at a party, after giving a reading in Seattle, when Theodore Roethke called him a â€œbourgeois poet.â€ù The question is why it caused Shapiro such severe unrest that he poured heart and soul into what is really one very long poem?,I suspect Shapiroâ€™s evident misery started early in his life with a heroic notion of the poet. Any poet knows that to become immortal all you have to do is write a single great poem. This is unlikely indeed. Perhaps there are tens of thousands of mules and draft horses across the countryside who dream of winning the Kentucky Derby. Better yet, a bartender in Seville told me last March, â€œWe have thousands of aspiring Lorcas but only one Lorca.â€ù Very early on a poet is struck by the cruelty and lack of democracy in the arts â€” so few get it all, and the hordes receive nothing but the pleasure and pain of an overdeveloped consciousness. Ted Kooser, the former United States poet laureate and a friend of Shapiroâ€™s at the time â€œThe Bourgeois Poetâ€ù was written, told me Shapiro was obsessed with the French symbolist poets. This explains a lot, since Shapiroâ€™s notion of what a poet was implies the outsider, the outcast, the outlier, one who purposefully deranges his mind to write poems like Rimbaud, or one who could not walk, so borne down was he by his giant wings, to paraphrase Baudelaire. I must here imagine myself an English department chairman, who has to deal with these troublesome creatures, and say that a poet is hubris through and through in the same manner that an unruly pig is solid pork.,Shapiro was massively famous in the 1940s and â€™50s, in the manner of Robert Lowell or Allen Ginsberg in the â€™60s and â€™70s, though his fame seemed to dip after â€œThe Bourgeois Poet.â€ù He served in World War II, then published â€œV-Letter and Other Poemsâ€ù and won the , at 32. He became consultant in poetry, now known as poet laureate. Later, on a prize committee made up of famous poets, he was one of only two who voted against awarding Ezra Pound the Bollingen Prize, and it was a grand literary scandal at the time. Shapiro cast his vote as a Jew in opposition to a renowned anti-Semite. He was also voting against the wishes of T. S. Eliot, the virtual pope of poetry during the postwar years. I would suggest the possibility of anti-Semitism in the decline of Shapiroâ€™s reputation. But when you begin your career as grandly as he did, where can you go but down?,â€œThe Bourgeois Poetâ€ù is disturbingly brilliant though occasionally it is inadvertently comic. How can you be , much less stridently Whitmanesque, on a campus in Nebraska? A poet must discover that itâ€™s his own story that is true, even if the truth is small indeed. The work is marvelous in small pieces but deflates a bit in the face of Shapiroâ€™s heroic posturing over what a poet is. There is a wonderful carelessness possible only because it is the kind of poem in which every sort of effluvium fits into the plan. The danger here is that it must be interesting effluvia.,Often in the poem Shapiro refers to himself as â€œThe Beepâ€ù:,He also writes, the torpor overwhelming:,And:,Perhaps as a corrective and a cautionary, â€œThe Bourgeois Poetâ€ù should be taught to the thousands taking M.F.A.â€™s in creative writing who wish to become poet-professors. As I said I tried it myself but found the work too hard. Thereâ€™s a subdued but relentless hurly-burly in academia that swallows up discretionary time. Itâ€™s like living with a slight backache, not fatal but enervating. Besides, academic salaries are falling behind and itâ€™s become questionable if poet-professors have truly achieved bourgeois status. Maybe lumpen bourgeois.,In the â€™60s I was actually on a committee in New York City with R. V. Cassill from Brown and Ben DeMott from Amherst, among others, trying to figure out how to get universities to hire more poets and novelists. Through no fault of our own it worked out that way.,Historically, of course, the scales are tipped in favor of the non-bourgeois poet. Yeats warned that the hearth was more dangerous for a poet than alcohol. Rilke said, â€œOnly in the rat race of the arena, does a heart learn to beat.â€ù Well off the margins of the page in â€œThe Bourgeois Poetâ€ù thereâ€™s an invisible Greek chorus singing, â€œYouâ€™ve got to earn a living.â€ù,Ultimately for a poet the fence is so high the top is invisible, but it is what we are designed to reach for. Everything else is mere scaffolding. You will most likely get the back of the museâ€™s hand whether you have a chair at Harvard or are pumping septic tanks in Missouri. I must say my sympathies are still with CÃ©sar Vallejo, a grander poet than anyone now living on our bruised earth. In Paris between the world wars Vallejo and his girlfriend would pick out the empty wine bottles in trash receptacles to earn their keep.",JIM HARRISON,"JAN. 28, 2007",Donâ€™t Feed the Poets,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Harrison2.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jules Verneâ€™s â€œJourney to the Center of the Earth,â€ù a survey of mid-19th-century geological controversies thinly disguised as a ripping yarn set in a dinosaur-inhabited subterranean realm, was a best seller when it was first published in France in 1864. Five years later, an upstate New York alternative healer named Cyrus Teed had a vision revealing that the earth is hollow and that weâ€™re all living on its concave inner surface. He eventually renamed himself Koresh, and established a thriving colony of hollow-earthers in the wilds of Florida. Then, in 1871, â€œThe Coming Race,â€ù by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in which the narrator discovers an advanced civilization underground, helped give rise to dozens of science-fiction novels in which travelers penetrated the icy polar realms and descended into a well-lighted netherworld via a whirlpool or tunnel.,Where did the outlandish notion that the earth is hollow come from, and why did it capture the imagination of 19th-century Americans? In his entertaining new book, the journalist David Standish traces Americaâ€™s hollow-earth craze to one John Cleves Symmes, a St. Louis trader who in 1818 self-published a circular gravely announcing that â€œthe earth is hollow and habitable within; containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other, and that it is open at the poles. ...â€ù The zone of ice near the poles, he argued, was merely a frozen ring surrounding a warm open sea leading to the interior.,The kookiest thing about Symmesâ€™s theory is how believable many found it. Not that it was without a semi-respectable scientific pedigree. As Standish recounts, several pioneering modern scientists and thinkers, including the English astronomer Edmond Halley, the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher and the Boston cleric Cotton Mather, had also advanced hollow-earth theories. (Since God would probably not have wanted to waste any space, Mather argued, an inhabitable hollow earth made perfect sense.),Symmes was less persuasive as a scientist, however, than as an advocate for a national expedition to locate the polar opening. One of his converts, an Ohio newspaper editor named Jeremiah Reynolds, joined Symmes on his lecture tour and later embarked on a failed polar expedition. Reynoldsâ€™s speeches and writings would in turn inspire the young Edgar Allan Poe to write â€œMs. Found in a Bottle,â€ù a career-launching story about a traveler sucked into an immense whirlpool at the South Pole. Poe later reprised the idea in â€œThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,â€ù which in turn inspired Jules Verne.,Standishâ€™s research is impressive, taking in everything from the British Enlightenment and American religious utopianism to such hollow-earth literature as Jacques Casanovaâ€™s five-volume 1788 novel â€œIcosameronâ€ù (about a society of nudist hermaphroditic dwarves) to Edgar Rice Burroughsâ€™s Pellucidar novels, in one of which Tarzan descends into a â€œSymmesâ€™s Holeâ€ù via zeppelin. But his efforts to explain the popularity of hollow-earth-ism â€” a Koreshan remnant survives today with the cult newsletter Hollow Earth Insider â€” are weak. Standish rather lamely suggests it â€œcan be seen as a sort of ultimate metaphysical retreat to the womb.â€ù As for the proliferation of hollow-earth fiction from the 1870s on, it can be chalked up to the fact that writers needed â€œsomewhere to set improbable romances now that formerly remote, unknown corners of the earth were becoming less believable as settings the more they were explored.â€ù Ho-hum!,In the topsy-turvy America of the 19th century, in which the Civil War, industrialization, and urbanization caused all that was solid to melt into air (as a contemporary of Symmes put it), what could have made more sense than an inside-out world? Today, when utopian literature is so often dismissed as proto-totalitarian, we need dismissive explanations of hollow-earth mania like we need a Symmesâ€™s Hole in the head. If Standishâ€™s larger ideas are less than satisfying, itâ€™s not because heâ€™s wrong. Itâ€™s only because we surface-dwellers have lost the capacity to imagine that another world is possible.",JOSHUA GLENN,"JAN. 28, 2007",Journeys to the Center,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Glenn.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œItâ€™s the cooking, the cleaning, the crying!â€ù wails Oscar in â€œThe Odd Coupleâ€ù when Felix has pushed him too far. In Rachel Cuskâ€™s latest novel, itâ€™s the cooking, the cleaning and the fact that beyond oneâ€™s own snarled household a million other women are doing the same. Her characters are quietly going berserk. Arlington Park isnâ€™t the end of the world; itâ€™s just suburbia. But, with a little exaggeration, the two become interchangeable.,Juliet was once thought exceptional and now is hardly noticed as she picks her way through traffic in the rain. Her husbandâ€™s failure to defend her against the oafishness of their host at a dinner party has led her to the conclusion that all men are killers. â€œThey take a woman, and little by little they murder her.â€ù Julietâ€™s impotent rage eventually finds expression in a haircut.,Amanda has a nasty contretemps with her tiny son when he asks awkward questions about a deformed man. She really seems to hate this kid. Her neighbor, Jocasta, is much kinder, marveling at the taupe coffin her daughter has prepared for a pet rabbit. (â€œDarling, how ,!â€ù) Amanda and her husband derive satisfaction only from the removal of interior walls: â€œTheir conversations on the subject of knocking through were so numerous and so energetic ... that the walls seemed almost to fall down by themselves.â€ù,Maisie has a kitchen she cannot bear to enter and companions she feels nothing for. â€œSheâ€™d get ... hysterical if someone stole her hair dryer,â€ù Maisie says of a woman her husband has made the mistake of praising. â€œSheâ€™d get pretty damned jumpy if her husbandâ€™s salary didnâ€™t come rolling in like a Pacific breaker every month, or if people stopped thinking she looked like Felicity Kendall.â€ù Not overtly competitive, these women freely grind one another into the dust in private.,Christine, nouveau riche and crass, is content â€” not with her husband or children, far from it, but with Arlington Park, in particular the mall. She even likes the way it looks from the parking lot. Cusk is hardest on Christine, simmering with contempt for the womanâ€™s lowly concerns: spending money, wearing purple and writing to the local paper. By the last chapter, Christine has more or less turned into the objectionable Beverly from Mike Leighâ€™s â€œAbigailâ€™s Party.â€ù (But Beverly was funnier.),Cuskâ€™s many female characters are far too similar, and you wish sheâ€™d stuck with one. Each exhibits low-level feminist outrage and ambivalence toward her family, but these traits are so muted and ineffectual they only add to the ennui. The novel comes straight out of the kitchen-sink school of British realism, thrashing through any sentimentality you might harbor about family life and suggesting that very little holds such structures together besides routine, nostalgia, financial dependence and an unthinking sense of duty. These are empty experiences, on offer to people who are not empty and who therefore suffer inordinately. Cusk laments this. â€œTo look at that view youâ€™d think that a human life was meaningless. Youâ€™d think that a day meant nothing at all.â€ù,The book eventually becomes one long postpartum gripe, though neither humane nor funny enough to be enjoyable as social satire. Why must the wife of an obnoxious man be â€œhorse-facedâ€ù? Another dope has a â€œcapacious chest.â€ù Denoting character flaws through physical defects seems beneath a writer of Cuskâ€™s intellectual bent. Too often, sheâ€™s grandiose when she could be friendly, convoluted when she needs to be clear, snooty when you want something tender. Sheâ€™s discerning about people and the passing thought, but she can be snobbish about class and overly fond of descriptive passages, telling us repeatedly of sagging skies and clouds. O.K., itâ€™s raining â€” we got it!,There are some great moments, but she tends to over-egg the pudding with metaphor, simile and melodramatic hyperbole when all sheâ€™s describing is a set of materially advantaged women getting through the day. None of the many hints of impending disaster lead anywhere. So when she writes: â€œThe empty black mouth of the fireplace stood open in frozen protest. In front of it an Indian rug lay twisted in an attitude of torment,â€ù you wish sheâ€™d lighten up. Thereâ€™s nothing worse than wasted ominousness.,Do these couples like one another at all? The husbands are a problem, but itâ€™s the children these women really canâ€™t stand. As in Cuskâ€™s nonfiction book on motherhood, â€œA Lifeâ€™s Work,â€ù children are seen here as vampiric usurpers of their mothersâ€™ bodies and souls. But sometimes the mothers fight back. â€œI could kill you!â€ù fumes one woman at someone elseâ€™s kid, who has just drawn on her white sofa with Magic Markers. â€œYouâ€™re ruining my life!â€ù rages another as she propels her daughterâ€™s lunchbox across the room. â€œElla,â€ù says Christine to her child, â€œif you donâ€™t shut up Iâ€™m going to rip your tongue out of your throat.â€ù Thatâ€™s telling her.,â€œArlington Parkâ€ù is the kind of book that makes you burn things on the stove and berate your husband. Cusk is good at identifying what she fears and reviles. The challenge would be to say what she cares about, even if it makes her sound silly. Dignity isnâ€™t everything.

"Among the many perverse diversions and delights of Jesse Kellermanâ€™s unnerving new thriller, , are his clinically detailed descriptions of all the variables that could drive a third-year medical student like Jonah Stem crazy. The sleep deprivation from putting in 16-hour days, six days a week, might do it alone. But compounding that constant assault on the nervous system are the abusive egomaniacal surgeons, the disgusting scut work on the colorectal ward and the staggering psychic misery of observing all the human suffering. That Kellerman maintains such a grimly hilarious perspective on his subject is its own twisted tribute to the survival instincts of writers who go down to the depths to entertain their readers. In Jonahâ€™s words, when he finds himself on the psych wing: â€œYou had to laugh. If you didnâ€™t, youâ€™d drown.â€ù,As this psychologically complex story develops, it isnâ€™t the normal crush of work and study that finally pushes this sensitive hero to the limits of his mental endurance. Itâ€™s a woman who calls herself Eve Jones. Jonah thought he was rescuing Eve from a violent death when he fought and killed a man he saw attacking her on a dark street on the far West Side of Manhattan. (Indeed, he has his moment of fame as a media hero: â€œSuperdoc Battles Sicko W/ Knife.â€ù) But Eve works her way into his bloodstream like a slow-acting poison, challenging his devotion to an ex-girlfriend who suffers from a debilitating neurological disorder and wickedly manipulating Jonahâ€™s emotional neediness to satisfy her own sadistic sexual tastes. Before Jonah realizes that this pain artist means it literally when she says â€œI love you to death,â€ù she has taken control of his life.,Eve may be too much of a monster to pass as a credible human being, but sheâ€™s a memorable character, with her mad theories on the aesthetics of pain and her genius at recognizing the wolfish impulses Jonah has repressed under his nice-guy persona. (â€œShe knew,â€ù Jonah acknowledges. â€œShe could divine latent rage.â€ù) Her feats of pure, guilt-free perversity also make her a wonderful foil for the amusingly clueless friends and family members against whose behavioral norms Jonah is subconsciously rebelling.,â€œHe needed to see how it felt to say no,â€ù Jonah says, when he first blows off one of his routine duty calls on his ex-girlfriend. â€œAnd now he knew: it felt O.K.â€ù But in a very short while, it will not feel O.K. at all, and Jonah can only wish he were back on the colorectal ward.,Thomas H. Cook is one of the most literary of psychological-suspense authors, and sometimes, as in , he allows his lyrical style to swamp his story. But while the suspense is minimal in this first-person account of an underachieving small-town lawyer who fears for the sanity of his gifted but unstable sister, the narrative is sustained by its thematic richness and the subtlety of its psychological portraits of tormented characters.,As children, both David Sears and his older sister, Diana, were subjected to grueling intellectual drills by their father, a paranoid schizophrenic given to frightening rages when a little boy stumbles over his lessons in Greek mythology. But unlike David, who resigns himself to being the dunce of the family, Diana is every bit as brilliant as her father â€” and perhaps as mad. That suspicion, first raised when Diana accuses her husband of having murdered their mentally disturbed son, becomes an obsession with David when she initiates his teenage daughter into her fanciful way of thinking. Although Cook is maddeningly coy about who actually killed whom, he writes eloquently about the fears that lead people to equate intelligence with madness, suppressing the imagination and taking refuge in mediocrity.,When Iâ€™m casting about for an antidote to the sugary female sleuths who solve crimes without disrupting their social calendars, Kate Shugak, the Aleut private investigator in Dana Stabenowâ€™s Alaskan mysteries, invariably comes to mind. In more than a dozen novels, Kate has demonstrated that she can shoot a rifle, butcher a moose, overhaul an engine and survive in remote regions of the Alaskan wilderness. More amazing yet, her outdoor skills donâ€™t alienate the rugged men in her life. , finds Kate under pressure from her relatives to get tough with a serial wife-killer whose luck at eluding the law has demoralized their entire village. For once, Kateâ€™s straight-arrow methods fail her, truth being an arbitrary concept in a community where local custom dictates justice. So forget all those hair-raising treks into the wild; joining the tribal council may well be the most dangerous move Kate has ever made.,Meanwhile, thousands of miles away on an Indian pueblo in New Mexico, a young female agent with the Bureau of Land Management puts some muscle into a homicide case with eerie mystical overtones. Making her striking debut in Sandi Aultâ€™s , Jamaica Wild watches a man trampled in a buffalo stampede. Despite the expression of rapture she saw on his face, she refuses to accept the Tanoah tribeâ€™s judgment that his death was a suicide and doggedly pursues an investigation that strains her relationship with the â€œpueblo motherâ€ù whoâ€™s initiating her into the Tanoah customs. Scenes of the high, dry, glittering landscape are as clean as a sun-bleached bone, and there are thrills galore when Jamaica is trapped in a flash flood that tears down the canyon walls of an ancient mountain sacred to the tribe. But Ault is no less artful at depicting the marriage customs, funeral rites and religious ceremonies that have drawn Jamaica to this tightly knit world and made her lose her heart to its people.",,"JAN. 28, 2007",Pain Artist,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Crime.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Around the time of the War of Independence, Americaâ€™s main contact with the Middle East consisted in trading Caribbean rum for Turkish opium. Itâ€™s hard not to wish, reading the epic story of this 230-year relationship, now usefully condensed into a single well-researched volume, that things could have remained as simple as the swapping of your recreational poison for mine.,But things never were quite so simple. Even then the potential for friction loomed as large as the possibility of mutual gain. Before the end of the Napoleonic wars, Christian sailors risked capture and enslavement by Muslim pirates from the Barbary ports of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli. Governments could either front protection money, cough up ransom or threaten force.,America tried all three approaches, and its erratic policy echoes with sad familiarity in the 21st century. We find the same wrangling in Washington between those who counsel appeasement (the cheaper, saner option) and those who demand armed action (the more glorious); bickering among Western capitals over whether to act singly or in concert (Thomas Jefferson tried to corral a coalition, but Congress balked); and daring strikes carried out with near-fatal clumsiness (an attempt to blockade Tripoli led to the capture, in 1803, of the U.S.S. Philadelphia and its 308-man crew, and a subsequent, heroically farcical attempt to free them by effecting regime change).,Michael B. Oren, an American-born Israeli scholar and the author of a well-received study of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, recounts such exploits with admirable detachment. â€œPower, Faith, and Fantasyâ€ù is hugely ambitious, drawing on hundreds of original sources to create a finely balanced overview of this enormously complex subject. Out of understandable necessity, the later chapters, dealing with more recent times and Americaâ€™s role as a superpower, preoccupied with a multilayered and often contradictory agenda in the Middle East, grow sketchier and less conclusive.,Yet it is a diverting tale over all, full of forgotten twists and memorable characters. Who remembers now, for instance, that the Statue of Liberty was initially conceived by her French sculptor as an Egyptian peasant girl, intended to adorn the entrance to the Suez Canal? Or that the first Zionists to settle in Palestine were in fact American Protestants, who planted successive, ill-fated colonies aimed at â€œrestoringâ€ù the Holy Land to Jews, so that their subsequent conversion to Christianity would speed the Second Coming? Or that Civil War veterans officered Egyptian campaigns in Sudan and Abyssinia? Or that before landing in North Africa during World War II, the United States Army dropped leaflets advertising the arrival of â€œHoly Warriors ... to fight the great jihad of freedomâ€ù?,Some of these episodes may sound trivial or obscure, but Oren cleverly weaves them into the overarching themes of his title. Consider Americaâ€™s missionary effort. The printing of native-language Bibles, and the founding of schools, clinics and three universities, in Cairo, Beirut and Istanbul, that remain among the best in the region, failed to win more than a trickle of converts. Yet a hundred years of American mission work produced some unexpected change.,It was, in part, the missionary doctorsâ€™ reputation for altruism that persuaded the Saudi king to offer his oil patch not to British, but to American prospectors. And while the proto-Zionist restorationist movement faded to the fringes of Protestant preaching â€” at least, until its revival by some modern evangelicals â€” a sentimental attachment to the ancient Hebrews infused the religious upbringing of Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, the two presidents who did most to cement American ties with ,.,Such underlying trends have seldom been so well explored, but Oren occasionally overstates their importance. Trumanâ€™s own words reveal that â€œfaithâ€ù was perhaps a secondary motive behind his crucial decision to back the creation of Israel. â€œI have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism,â€ù Oren quotes Truman as explaining. â€œI do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs in my constituents.â€ù,Important context is missing from some of the bookâ€™s pages. Oren artfully touches on Middle Eastern influence on American popular culture, from the hootchy-kootchy dance to Camel cigarettes, but tends to dissociate this from the wider Western tradition of Orientalism. There is much gory detail about the Armenian genocide, but scant mention of the fact that Ottoman Turkey faced repeated invasion by a Russia whose czars, disastrously for the Ottomansâ€™ Armenian subjects, claimed leadership of all Orthodox Christians. At several junctures, Oren paints Europe as stubbornly resistant to American policy, without adequately substantiating the charge or explaining European motives. We hear nothing of how Americaâ€™s fateful, post-World War I decision to restrict , helped push desperate Jewish refugees toward Palestine.,While correctly noting the peculiar mix of cultural disdain and romantic fascination that has marked American attitudes to Muslim Middle Easterners, Oren curiously declines to distance himself from some unflattering views. We hear, for instance, of an 18th-century diplomat whose â€œexperience had taught him that in the Middle East power alone was respected,â€ù as if this were a quality unique to the region. And a hint of distaste sometimes infuses his language. The landmass of the Middle East curves â€œscimitar-like through Arabia.â€ù Elsewhere, Oren speaks blithely of â€œnameless Middle Eastern thugsâ€ù and â€œthe ubiquity of Arab terror.â€ù Such shopworn phrases tend to compound, rather than dispel, preconceived notions of the Middle East as a kind of unfathomable Badland.,Commendably, in a work of such scope, there are very few errors of fact or omission. Yet, as a reserve major in the Israeli Army, Oren ought to know that Israelâ€™s 1982 invasion of Lebanon was not provoked by the P.L.O. â€œregularly strikingâ€ù at Galilee. ,â€™s group was certainly an elemental threat to the Jewish state, but had actually been observing a long, American-brokered cease-fire before ,â€™s drive to Beirut. It is also odd that the author hardly touches upon the influence of the pro-Israel lobby, or on the issue of United States financial and military aid to Israel, factors undeniably crucial to any understanding of Americaâ€™s involvement with todayâ€™s Middle East.,Oren mostly avoids the temptation to seek historical parallels to modern events. The occasions when he succumbs reveal the peril for historians of this habit. Toward the bookâ€™s conclusion, for instance, he avers that â€œby protecting themselves from Middle Eastern threats while simultaneously trying to assist native people, U.S. forces in Iraq were, in effect, revisiting the earliest American involvement in the region.â€ù Surely, as we now know, the threat to America posed by Saddam Husseinâ€™s Iraq was more fantastical than real, until, that is, American forces hit the ground there.,Such subtle reinforcement of Americaâ€™s self-image as an innocent among Middle Eastern sharks mars an otherwise exemplary work. This is a pity, since, as Oren amply illustrates, it is Americaâ€™s failure to be clear and honest about its own motives, as much as its serial failure to interpret the Middle East, that has so often befuddled relations with the region.",MAX RODENBECK,"JAN. 28, 2007",Midnight at the Oasis,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Rodenbeck.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" are at once the most amazing and frustrating of medical miracles. A new kidney or heart can cure someone who would otherwise die or, even in less than ideal circumstances, extend life and improve well-being. The surgical skill and pharmaceutical innovation required to make transplantation work are wonders of human ingenuity.,But there is still no such thing as a truly new organ. Unlike insulin or artificial hips, organs so far cannot be successfully manufactured. They come only pre-owned, usually from young, healthy people who have died suddenly in traumatic accidents that destroyed their brains. Rainy weekends increase the organ supply. Helmet laws reduce it. The more than 94,000 Americans on the waiting list for organs are, in effect, waiting for someone else to die so that they can live.,This grisly calculus posed enormous cultural problems for early transplant advocates, as Kieran Healy, a sociologist at the University of Arizona and a contributor to the blog Crooked Timber, notes in â€œLast Best Gifts.â€ù â€œPublic ambivalence about transplantation was overcome, in part, by arguing that donation was the â€˜gift of life,â€™ â€ù he writes. â€œThe success of this idea now makes it more difficult to garner support for a market for organs.â€ù By emphasizing altruism, transplant advocates gave comfort to the bereaved, conferring meaning on a tragic event and justifying what might otherwise seem like desecration. This early success helps explain why, even in the face of a critical shortage of organs, many leaders in the transplant field oppose any financial incentives for organ donors, including tax credits or payment toward funeral expenses.,The â€œgift of lifeâ€ù story is useful but, according to Healy, oversimplified. Shaped by a strongly anticommercial ideology, it places too much emphasis on the division between giving and selling. It doesnâ€™t acknowledge the diverse ways in which people define the social meanings of exchange, regardless of whether money is involved. The fable of heroic altruists also misleadingly emphasizes the motives of the donor (or the donorâ€™s family) over the system in which the decision to give or not takes place. â€œThe voluntary donation of human goods is an organizational accomplishment,â€ù Healy argues.,Just as businesses in the same industry may have different rates of profit, organ procurement organizations â€” the regional groups charged with managing cadaver organs â€” have different rates of success in persuading families to part with the organs of their loved ones. Some of those results depend on regional characteristics, from population density (which makes it easier to get organs to recipients quickly) to race (blacks, for example, are somewhat less likely to donate organs or support the idea of donation more generally). But along with such basic organizational differences as budget and number of referring hospitals, environmental differences like these account for only about half of the variation. Clearly something more â€” call it â€œmanagementâ€ù â€” is at work.,Consider the South Carolina Organ Procurement Agency, which has increased its donation rate by 83 percent since 1997. The agency not only expanded its field staff from eight to 21, it changed its methods. â€œThe person who explained to families that their loved one was brain dead, and who spent a considerable amount of time (perhaps a whole day) helping them with this realization, was no longer the person who requested consent for donation,â€ù Healy writes. This separation of roles may sound like common sense, but it requires organizational insight into the emotional state of donor families.,As an economic sociologist, Healy adds important dimensions to the intensifying debate over organ procurement. He reminds both advocates and opponents of markets that commercial transactions are embedded in social structures and as likely as any other exchanges to have social meaning. To succeed, incentives must show sensitivity to those meanings. A direct payment to a funeral home, for example, could honor a donor familyâ€™s decision without making them seem to profit from their loved oneâ€™s death. Or healthy adults could make binding contracts to be organ donors if they die in the right circumstances, with life insurance paid for by transplant centers, the government or a private foundation going to their heirs.,The bookâ€™s major shortcoming is its failure to address the fastest growing source of organs: living donors. More than two-thirds of the people on the national waiting list â€” about 68,000 â€” need kidneys. There are nowhere near enough brain-dead accident victims to fill that demand, regardless of family beneficence or organizational efficiency. Fortunately, nobody has to die to supply a kidney. They can come from living donors, who can live perfectly normal lives with a single kidney and who now account for nearly 40 percent of all kidney transplants. With the kidney shortage at crisis proportions, the debate over financial incentives is really a debate over whether living adults should be allowed to sell their own organs or, at the least, receive a tax credit or some other indirect compensation.,Although he barely mentions living donors, Healyâ€™s sociological message resonates through that debate. Financial incentives would operate within complex organizational structures, as well as contract and liability law. Bureaucratic institutions, notably hospitals and insurers, would shape the environment in which transplants take place. Many kidney sellers would still have humanitarian motives. â€œThe idea that markets inevitably corrupt,â€ù Healy writes, â€œis not tenable precisely because they are embedded within social relations, cultural categories and institutional routines.â€ù Commerce isnâ€™t antithetical to culture; it is part of it.",VIRGINIA POSTREL,"JAN. 28, 2007",Grim Harvest,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Postrel.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rather than cloning the original art-filled Chambers boutique hotel in New York, the Midwestern outpost, which opened in September, strikes an independent profile in a gallerylike compound  fashioned from two neighboring pre-1910 brick low-rise office buildings with a   a courtyard-cum-lounge in between. Interiors and exteriors showcase the estimable contemporary art collection of the owner, the , developer Ralph Burnet, helping to increase Minneapolis's emerging stature as the artiest town on the prairie.,Pedestrian friendly. The Chambers's downtown locale is walking distance of theaters, the Target Center sports arena, warehouse district restaurants and retail-centric Nicollet Avenue.,The high-tech rooms are a bit cold. A throw rug over the black-stained wood floors  would have warmed up my gallery-white standard room, No. 512. But cloudlike feather bedding, down pillows and high-thread-count linens compensate. Business travelers and e-mail users are well served with  an expansive desk and countertop that lines an entire wall, as well as with  free Wi-Fi and D.S.L. A painting by the local artist Rod Massey, decorative vases and a video art channel on the 42-inch plasma television confirm the art theme.,Functionally stylish. An opaque window wall in the shower plays peek-a-boo with the entry foyer on the other side. A German-made metal â€œrampâ€ù sink by Alape slopes back toward the blue-glass-tiled wall, heated tiles pave the floor and a 13-inch flat-screen television faces the toilet.,The Chambers's chief asset is its $7 million art collection spanning painting, sculpture, photography, neon and hybrids like a wall hanging of Indian chipati tongs by Subodh Gupta. Works by Damien Hirst and other marquee  artists  are displayed in an adjacent gallery that rotates Mr. Burnet's collection, while video art flashes in the lobby, lounge and guestroom corridors.,The Ã_ber-chef ,Jean-Georges Vongerichten created the menu at the paper-lantern-lighted Chambers Kitchen, where the local fish, walleye, is dressed  up with basil and jalapeno ($18). A glass-walled and balcony-ringed bar on the top floor draws a hip, partying crowd, but soundproof doors seal the noise from guestroom hallways.,The outdoor courtyard has a large fire pit and screenings of experimental films on the whitewashed walls. The lobby's shopping nook sells  Barbara Kruger tote bags ($65); skateboard decks by a local artist, Sean Tubridy ($58); and Yoshitomo Nara clocks ($250). The basement fitness center was overheated at 75 degrees and offered no privacy from  staff members passing in a service corridor.,Guests must call for morning coffee ($4 per cup) â€” there is no maker in the room â€” but delivery is speedy. (My order arrived in less than 10 minutes.) All food comes from the Chambers Kitchen, which bears Mr. Vongerichten's stamp even in breakfast basics like a bagel and smoked salmon, which comes with an endive salad dressed in sherry vinaigrette ($16).,Guests on a Friday night looked like the 40-something sophisticates who might buy the modern art on the walls, whereas the younger, bohemian lounge set looked like those who had created it.

"Chris Abani has done an end-run around the immigrant novel. In two previous books, Abani, who was born in Nigeria, traced a path from third world to first: â€œGraceLand,â€ù his bustling novel set in Lagos, closed with a young manâ€™s departure for the United States; his novella â€œBecoming Abigailâ€ù followed the title character from Nigeria to London. Abani now teaches at the University of California, Riverside, and his strange new novel is set in Los Angeles. Rather than adopting the perspective of a newcomer, though, he gives us Black, a mural artist raised in California, the son of a Nigerian father and a Salvadoran mother. Black was called Obinna as a boy, but after his father went missing in Vietnam, he lost his name along with any connection to his African ancestry.,Now 36 and at loose ends, he dresses himself from time to time in a filched wedding gown, and in that guise is repeatedly mistaken for an apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe. But really thatâ€™s the least of his troubles: tormented by dark memories, suicidal impulses and persistent, unrelieved erections, heâ€™s obsessed with a transsexual stripper named Sweet Girl, and is being stalked by the Angel Gabriel, who sometimes assumes the form of a pigeon. His best friends are Iggy, a tattoo artist and psychic (and the owner of the wedding dress) who rents him a room behind her cafe, and a Rwandan named Bomboy who owns a slaughterhouse â€” though these two are little more than bystanders to his crisis.,Black is all desire and no direction, and his story takes shape as a mystery of identity, as he wanders the city trying to reconcile himself to his memories and his peculiar urges. Above all itâ€™s the matter of his roots that haunts him: â€œHe was trying to reinvent an origin to bury so he could finally come into this thing he wanted to be.â€ù His deceased parents represent not only different cultures but the poles of science and faith: his father was an arrogant postdoctoral researcher for NASA who disparaged religion, his mother a devout Catholic who went around the bend after her husbandâ€™s death and would beat Black in front of an altar. But his father also had him wear a white dress as a young boy, to ward off a family curse, and Black carries a picture of himself so attired in a pouch strung around his neck. His wedding dress fixation has something to do with the undigested legacies of both parents, as does the fact that heâ€™s built a blimplike hideout for himself â€” his spaceship, he calls it â€” with an altar inside.,His art, meanwhile, engages questions of what is socially offensive. He covers one wall of Iggyâ€™s shop with racist and sexist jokes collected from public restrooms, interspersed with lines of poetry; he decorates the wall of Bomboyâ€™s business with a painting of a 50-foot Muslim woman, totally covered, strangling a dove with one hand and carrying an AK-47 in the other.,Abani likewise traffics in the outrageous when Bomboy wears a T-shirt with a picture of a lynching and the slogan â€œJust Hanging,â€ù or when a certain stripper is mentioned for her ability to shoot Ping- Pong balls out of her labia. But what heâ€™s really interested in are people on the margins, and he samples both Raymond Chandler â€” a dwarf waiter at Iggyâ€™s cafe named Ray-Ray parrots lines from â€œFarewell, My Lovelyâ€ù â€” and Diane Arbus, who is quoted in the epigraph. Abaniâ€™s Los Angeles is at turns desolate and luminous, showered with ash from distant brush fires, â€œa city constantly digesting its past and recycling itself into something new.â€ù This metropolis is one where unlikely-looking Virgins draw crowds, bullet-ridden bodies go unnoticed in swimming pools and unwanted dogs are tossed from cars off a bridge. Itâ€™s also a perpetual blank canvas, which Black loves because it allows him to be whatever he wants â€” if only he could figure out what that was.,Cross-dressing, sexual confusion and the melding (or meltdown?) of cultures also figured prominently in â€œGraceLand,â€ù and that book also tapped into the energy of its urban setting. Abaniâ€™s portrayal of Lagos was richer and more authoritative than his version of Los Angeles, however, and the chaotic third-world terrain could better accommodate his sudden shifts from misery to comedy to violence. The combination is jarring here: in one scene, Bomboy tells of having taken part in a massacre of Tutsi women and children in Rwanda; in another, heâ€™s scheming to sell call-to-prayer alarm clocks to Muslim countrymen back home. Black converses with a divine pigeon and tries to calm an erection with a bag of frozen peas; he also recalls watching his mother masturbate while she was dying of AIDS.,Just as Black combines racist jokes and lines from Wallace Stevens in a work entitled â€œAmerican Gothic â€” The Remix,â€ù so Abani imagines a place that is horrifying and tender and absurd in equal measure. But with its uneven tone and meandering story, the book doesnâ€™t quite hold together. The language veers from portentous to reportorial, and sometimes falls flat, as in a dull first-date scene between Black and Sweet Girl. As a result the final conflagration carries less impact than it might have.,Still, these are the missteps of an ambitious writer with an original perspective. In â€œThe Virgin of Flamesâ€ù he audaciously stakes his claim on a city not his own. And wisely, he doesnâ€™t so much try to reveal its hidden side as to give it a costume, or a paint job, of his own making.",KAREN OLSSON,"JAN. 28, 2007",The Recycled City,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Olsson.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In daily life, obsessive, all-consuming, world-annihilating rage is not a healthy emotion, but for horror fiction itâ€™s motherâ€™s milk. In horror, very bad things have to happen to people â€” or, at the least, to impend ominously â€” and the perpetrators of those atrocities tend to be in extraordinarily foul moods, especially when, as in the case of ghosts and zombies, they have recently risen from the dead. They always wake up cranky.,It makes sense: having oneâ€™s eternal rest interrupted is bound to be annoying. But the sort of rude reawakening that occurs in horror stories isnâ€™t usually involuntary. The genreâ€™s dangerous deceased have more typically roused , from the Big Sleep by an unnatural act of will, which implies a degree of motivation that a normal, well-adjusted ex-person would be unable to muster. To bust out of the prison cell of death, whose doors arenâ€™t meant to be opened from the inside, a soul has to be mighty uneasy â€” angry as hell and prepared to do some serious damage.,A significant percentage of horror fiction, that is, consists of cosmic revenge fantasies, tales of wrath long nurtured and suddenly, catastrophically released. Some of the genreâ€™s venerable monster species, like vampires and werewolves, are colder-blooded than that â€” doing violence just because theyâ€™re hungry, and losing their tempers only when theyâ€™re thwarted â€” but in the books Iâ€™ve been reading lately most of the agents of destruction are entities that feel, as the English say, hard done by: bitter, resentful, victimized. We live in angry times, and the chip-on-the-shoulder surliness of horrorâ€™s current crop of supernatural avengers can seem disturbingly familiar.,But the level of real-world resonance in the genreâ€™s raging revenants varies widely. Itâ€™s pretty low, for example, in Joe Schreiberâ€™s first novel, , and John Saulâ€™s umpteenth, , in both of which the choleric chickens coming home to roost are the spirits of dead serial killers and multiple murderers.,In Saulâ€™s book, the aggregate lethal fury of Jack the Ripper, Ed Gein, Jeffrey Dahmer and Lizzie Borden is reanimated in a Wisconsin lakeside resort at high season. In Schreiberâ€™s shorter, livelier campfire tale, the mayhem is perpetrated by a fictional late-18th-century New England serial killer named Isaac Hamilton, who has managed to resurrect himself with some regularity for better than two centuries. These novels are constructed as efficient, relentless terror-,generating machines, and as such donâ€™t require (much less encourage) the reader to think about the sources of the florid homicidal rage they put on display. Thatâ€™s just as well, really. The grievances of narcissistic sociopaths, while impressively comprehensive, get old fast: narcissists are always aggrieved about ,By relying on evildoers whose nihilistic anger is almost unrecognizable as an actual human impulse, however, these writers miss a chance to unnerve their readers more profoundly. â€œIn the Dark of the Nightâ€ù toys with the provocative notion that the malign spirits of famous old murderers have some sort of mysterious allure for the middle-class, well-brought-up teenage boys who are its main characters. But in the end Saul prefers to transfer the bloodthirsty urges of the dead maniacs to an aging local maniac rather than to any of his young heroes, who snap out of their dark serial-killer enchantment before theyâ€™ve done anything that might raise a red flag on their college applications. To call this a failure of the novelistâ€™s nerve would be to understate the case. Itâ€™s infuriating to read a horror story that sets up a genuinely disturbing premise and then pulls back from its nastier implications. (We readers can get a little hot under the collar too.),Schreiber doesnâ€™t run the same risk because the wrath of his Isaac Hamilton is never presented as anything but alien, aberrant, utterly beyond the pale â€” nothing an ordinary person might feel sneakily attracted to, or find huddled in the dim, hard-to-get-at corners of his own miserable soul, which are the places horror fiction is supposed to illuminate. So â€œChasing the Deadâ€ù isnâ€™t disappointing in the way Saulâ€™s novel is â€” just frivolous, like a teen-market slasher picture.,Pure fear-mongering sensationalism has, of course, a perfectly honorable tradition in this genre, but these days it seems kind of beside the point. The problem with books and movies that traffic in what Coleridge called â€œmotiveless malignityâ€ù is that the malignities weâ€™re currently most afraid of are all overstuffed with motive, positively engorged with it. Everybodyâ€™s nursing a grudge; no act of violence comes without fervent self-justification; and rage with reasons â€” feeding on itself, gathering awful strength â€” is beginning to look like the fire that will consume the world.,In , the reliably apocalyptic Bentley Little imagines that sort of ferocious, score-settling historical anger as a network of trains that become â€œa single supernatural force capable of crisscrossing the nation in endless pursuit of vengeance.â€ù These trains, itâ€™s quickly apparent, have a political agenda: one plows into the White House and another into Mount Rushmore. Their passengers are â€œthe wronged, the massacred, the deadâ€ù â€” the spirits of the Chinese immigrants whose ill-paid labor built the transcontinental railroad.,Itâ€™s a well-chosen metaphor, and the fact that the vengeance being exacted is based on an unarguably legitimate beef gives â€œThe Burningâ€ù a nice edge of nervous ambivalence. The suspense of the narrative is actually less compelling than the suspense of the argument Little seems to be conducting with himself: heâ€™s trying to reconcile his respect for the exploited peopleâ€™s urge for retribution with the proper revulsion at the expired victimsâ€™ scorched-earth methods. Mixed into this steaming compost of self-doubt, I suspect, is a pinch of guilt on the writerâ€™s part about having perhaps discharged his genre obligations too vigorously: it is, after all, Little himself who dreamed up those terrible things for the dead Chinese to do and for the book â€” finally, dutifully â€” to condemn.,And some of the requisite horror effects do feel a bit arbitrary. Thereâ€™s a fuzzy black mold that turns people into racists, a pair of naked Chinese ghost nymphets who seduce a park ranger and a swarm of bees that arranges itself, for no earthly (or plausibly unearthly) reason, in the shape of George Washingtonâ€™s face. The book is a mess, a snarl of half-formed ideas, but at least it has ideas, and Little certainly canâ€™t be accused of failing to give rage its due. In a sense, his whole career â€” 16 previous novels and a short-story collection â€” has been an elaborate self-conducted anger management program, from which he has yet to graduate. â€œThe Burningâ€ù is just the latest in a series of Little novels in which boiling-mad victims of one social injustice or another set out to redress the wrongs done to them, and go way too far. And in all his books the writer appears to be working extremely hard to keep his sympathy for these angry devils from getting the better of him. In every novel, he maintains a running auto-critique, heckling himself like a drunken doppelgÃ_nger in the audience, with the invective intensifying noticeably as the act nears its conclusion.,At the big, wild climax of â€œThe Burningâ€ù â€” rather late in the game, youâ€™d imagine, for second thoughts â€” Little allows one of his characters to muse: â€œAs crazy as everything else was, the concept of a politically correct monster seemed the most ridiculous and hardest to believe.â€ù Little sounds ticked off at his own concept, steamed that his horror trains, with their cargo of righteous indignation, have somehow jumped the tracks. The fury of â€œThe Burningâ€ù is so deep, so anguished and so general that it refuses to spare even its author.,The most satisfying of the genreâ€™s recent rage extravaganzas, though, is Sarah Langanâ€™s first novel, , Like Little, Langan is interested in the release of pent-up anger from reasonable gripes: in this case, the source is the indignity visited, year after grinding year, on the residents of a fictional New England factory town.,The story begins a month after the closing of the Clott Paper Mill in Bedford, Me. The town â€” whatâ€™s left of it at the end of a decade or so of layoffs and wearying attempts to deny the writing on the wall â€” is depressed, uncertain, quietly panicky. Among the many unhealthy forms this collective unease takes, along with alcoholism, domestic abuse and a pervasive meanness of spirit, are shared nightmares, which focus on the most visibly wretched member of the community: a mute, disturbed, flagrantly promiscuous young woman named Susan Marley. While sheâ€™s alive, sheâ€™s the embodiment of her neighborsâ€™ fears for themselves â€” and when she dies, her hold on the sad, sick town becomes even more powerful. In death, Susan Marley comes into her own, and so, in an appropriately abandoned, self-immolating way, does Bedford.,â€œThe Keeperâ€ù â€” which is richly populated with small-town characters at varying stages of emotional crisis, from numb puzzlement to unshakable bitterness to abject despair â€” is as angry as any of the other novels Iâ€™ve been discussing, but itâ€™s the only horror story Iâ€™ve read recently that finds adequate metaphors for the self-destructive properties of anger.,â€œTheir rage at what had been done to them had no place to go but within,â€ù Langan writes of the people of Bedford, and you can feel it throughout â€œThe Keeper,â€ù growing like a cancer and debilitating the town until this entire complex social organism has no will but the will to merciful oblivion. And thatâ€™s when rage becomes truly horrifying: when everyone has forgotten how the poison got into the system and no one knows, or cares, how to get it out.",TERRENCE RAFFERTY,"JAN. 28, 2007",Bitter Spirits,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Rafferty2.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Somewhere off the coast of Vietnam in the mid-15th century, in a stretch of cantankerous ocean where typhoons raged and pirates plied their trade, the Dragon Sea claimed a kitchen girl who cowered in the galley of a junk. The ship groaned and buckled, and as it sank the icy seawater thundered through the galley. Eventually â€œthe girlâ€™s struggles stopped. ... Life faded from her eyes as around her the water grew dark with depth.â€ù,Surely this girl, probably a domestic or a slave, had no claim to the porcelain that plummeted along with her to the floor of the sea. But she was the lost cargoâ€™s lone sentry until, nearly 500 years later, the treasure was salvaged by a marine archaeologist, Mensun Bound; a Malaysian businessman, Ong Soo Hin; and a multinational crew of 160 seamen, archaeological draftsmen, cooks and saturation divers.,Frank Pope, a protÃ©gÃ© of Boundâ€™s and the expeditionâ€™s archaeological manager, has written an engaging account that delves into the ethical conundrums of marine salvage, the deadly physics of the deep ocean and the roiling waters of professional subterfuge.,â€œDragon Seaâ€ù is laced with drama largely because of the conflicting motives of the expeditionâ€™s leading figures. Bound, the headstrong, sometimes prickly director of Oxford Universityâ€™s Maritime Archaeological Research and Excavation unit, advocates the purest methodology in the recovery and insists on adding to the historical record. Ong, whom Pope describes as a corner-cutting financier with a smash-and-grab track record in marine salvage, wants pay dirt. As Pope tells the story, Ong needed Boundâ€™s credibility to cut international red tape. Bound needed the funding Ong could bring and got in bed with market forces (a racy move for an academic). After all, Pope writes, â€œwrecks were fast disappearing at the hands of dredgers and cable-layers as well as treasure-hunters, while archaeologists stood by helplessly, lacking the funds to work.â€ù,The idea was to bring up the booty, conserve and analyze it properly, then auction off a part of it to pay for the excavation (and make a tidy profit). The rest would be preserved for museums and history.,They made their pact. And then lived to regret it.,Ho hum, you might think, as I initially did, at the thought of old, wet porcelain. But Popeâ€™s impassioned, detailed reporting draws us into the story of ceramics and Vietnam, a country that has spent much of its past in the shadow of China, but enjoyed a brief self-ruled â€œgolden ageâ€ù during which artistic and political independence flourished. A central question of the book becomes: Are these relics from that short renaissance in the mid-15th century? If so, theyâ€™d hold clues that could rewrite a part of history.,But the archaeological and historical mysteries are eclipsed by the physiological ones because saturation diving to retrieve ceramics entombed 230 feet underwater is a complex, expensive â€” and somewhat wacko â€” endeavor.,This high-stakes, high-risk job requires a breed that makes North Sea fishermen look like wussies. Talk about pressure. They work on the seabed in wet suits, tethered to the ship above by a life-sustaining umbilical cord. At the end of an exhausting 12-hour shift of moving debris through giant vacuums, and digging out and packing porcelain, as well as negotiating dark waters, site grates and instructions from above by those who are video-monitoring, they enter a cramped pressurized bell and are hauled shipboard. That bell is affixed to another small bell, where they stay until going underwater again 12 hours later. They never leave the bells, and thus never depressurize. For two months.,The hazards are many. An infinitesimal leak caused by a faulty seal or loose screw in a pressurized bell and theyâ€™re instantly, and dramatically, dead. Gas â€œexplodes from the chest, rupturing the lungs if it is unable to escape the throat. Gas bursts from the sinuses, ripping open the eardrums. Vapors trapped inside the bowels expand. ... Explosive decompression is not a pleasant way to die.â€ù,Toward the end, the book begins to fizzle. Popeâ€™s crack job of blending storms and tension, regional history, the gruff cast of characters â€” and even the occasional cliffhanger and red herring â€” creates expectations. Weâ€™re half-waiting for M.C.D., Massive Catastrophic Decompression, either literally or metaphorically. So when the climax is merely ill will, a dashed romance of treasure hunting and trust â€” not, thankfully, â€œPerfect Stormâ€ù-like tragedy â€” weâ€™re both relieved, and slightly guilty for wanting more.,More than 250,000 intact pots were successfully excavated from the seabed before an encroaching typhoon season brought the expedition to an undramatic close.,The bookâ€™s final message is an elegiac plea that the estimated three million wrecks still lying untouched in the worldâ€™s oceans be addressed with integrity. But weâ€™re not left with any real hope that that will be the case.,The Internet frenzy of 2000 figures into the porcelainâ€™s final chapter. Brushing aside traditional auctioneers like Sothebyâ€™s and Christieâ€™s, Ong tries to cash out via the sexy new player: eBay. A saturated market and botched auction saddled with fuzzy historical information (which enrages Bound) all contribute to a huge financial loss. Ong spent $14 million to recover the cargo and bring it to auction, and in the end the porcelain cleared just under $3 million.,Five years later, to complete the circle, and see the final act of consumerism colliding with historical significance, I logged on. Now itâ€™s a fire sale. For $55, plus $9 shipping and handling, I purchased a blue-and-white round ceramic box. Itâ€™s gorgeous, but I only want to slide it back into the ocean, and return it to the kitchen girl.",HOLLY MORRIS,"JAN. 28, 2007",What Lies Beneath,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Morris.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WHEN night falls in New York or Paris, one goes clubbing or bar hopping. In a Texas park, the choices include bat detecting; in the Channel Islands of Britain, full-moon tidal treks; and in St. Louis, candlelight museum prowls.,More and more resorts, spas and tourist attractions are offering creative alternatives to dining and drinking the night away. Keyed to the science and mood of darkness, and inaugurated by activities like turtle-nesting watches in Costa Rica and guided stargazing in Hawaii, the new breed of night programs breaks from the mold of ghost-telling tours and pub crawls in nocturnal outings that range from novel to educational.

"There are all sorts of books about lions. Accounts of lions who come to stay are always popular, as Joy Adamson discovered when she wrote â€œBorn Freeâ€ù and its sequels. These books succeed because the idea of sharing oneâ€™s life with such a creature is, at some deep level, very appealing. Then there is writing in which lion imagery is used to make a point about the human rather than the leonine situation. In such a context, the lion is symbolic of vigor, of the masculine, of the untamable. Indeed, so burdened are lions with symbolism that itâ€™s surprising they manage to stagger even a few paces, let alone spring at their prey.,I came to â€œA Tale of Two Lions,â€ù by the Mexican writer Roberto Ransom (translated by Jasper Reid, son of the well-known Scottish essayist and translator Alastair Reid), in a mood of enthusiastic anticipation, being well-disposed toward lions and their literary depiction. Ever since I read Russell Hobanâ€™s remarkable â€œLion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boazâ€ù some years ago, I have been looking for another piece of leonine magic realism.,Lion books need not be long, but they do need meat. And while Ransomâ€™s book is charming, it is perhaps a bit too brief to explore its theme of lions lost and found. Two main stories are brought together, to an extent, in a third, but â€œA Tale of Two Lionsâ€ù is really just one long short story, or a shortish novella. The Thurberesque drawings that punctuate the book donâ€™t add a great deal to a story that, on its own, is perfectly engaging. There might also have been fewer pages of preliminaries, one of which bears a single sentence reminding us of the line used in old maps to fill unknown spaces: â€œHere there are lions.â€ù (Perhaps this is a warning about the virtually blank pages weâ€™ll encounter later on?),The first story takes the epistolary form and concerns a lion â€” small enough to pass for a cat, but leonine in its exuberant habits â€” that travels in an aircraft from Italy to the United States and then goes missing. In the next story, we are in a museum where a lion on display suddenly leaps out of an exhibit. (This is a lovely idea, and the relationship between the museum attendant and the lion is poignantly described.) Finally, we find ourselves in a circus, where the two lions meet. The first lion, Cattino, speaks Italian (a nice conceit), but all too soon both animals disappear. We are left wondering just who was who.,Itâ€™s all very whimsical, but that, of course, is what a picaresque novel can be. Ransomâ€™s lions are elusive, and deliberately so: we see them, and then they appear to be something else; they are gone, yet they are somehow within us. Itâ€™s like a half-remembered dream â€” or an unexpected sighting of a real lion in the bush.",ALEXANDER McCALL SMITH,"JAN. 28, 2007",Big Cats,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/McCall_Smith.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the late 1940s and early 1950s, broadcasting experts predicted that the advent of television would kill off radio. Many of them didnâ€™t especially want it to survive, since it could only hold back the acceptance of TV. In fact, the radio those experts knew didnâ€™t survive. By the mid-1950s, the national networks that had dominated since the â€™20s had all but evaporated, replaced by more than twice as many local stations. Television took over presenting broadcast drama and comedy, variety shows and in-depth news.,Yet radio itself survived. Radio outstrips television as a means of conveying intimacy and, precisely because it doesnâ€™t show but can only tell, may stir the active imagination more deeply. Itâ€™s cheaper to operate a radio station, and in those years broadcasting equipment was much more mobile, making it perfect for local presentations. With recorded music (before the advent of TV, most radio programming consisted of live performance), stations found a cheap programming source that attracted enough listeners to generate its lifeblood â€” advertising revenue â€” even after TV took hold.,In â€œSomething in the Air,â€ù Marc Fisher takes the story from there, arguing that radio â€” those who programmed and performed on it, and the music they played â€” inspired his entire generation to come together: â€œWe grew up dancing and dreaming to the same soundtrack, and we were therefore somehow united,â€ù he writes. â€œUntil the Great Unraveling of the late 1960s and early â€™70s, this shared pop culture was a meeting ground for our nation, a commons that we only years later realized we had lost.â€ù,But Fisher canâ€™t deliver on this premise, because it simply isnâ€™t true. Different groups of people experienced that period differently, and they listened to radio differently too. The kids in Fisherâ€™s neighborhood, and mine, spent 1963 listening to the Chiffons and Motown and were led to dream of a better world. The black kids in Birmingham, Ala., spent part of that year listening to local radio not only for those hit records but for coded messages about where to gather for illegal demonstrations that concretely changed their world for the better. Those are not equivalent experiences.,But most of â€œSomething in the Airâ€ù isnâ€™t concerned with its broad premise, and therein lies the bookâ€™s value. It provides a history of the development of radio in the postwar era, but it works best when it backs away from the general and settles upon particular broadcasters who fascinate Fisher. He writes engagingly about the late-night giants Jean Shepherd and Bob Fass, the shock jock Tom Leykis, the National Public Radio co-founder Bill Siemering, the Long Island radio rebel Paul Sidney and the white R & B disc jockey Hunter Hancock.,There are reasons to quarrel with the history. Fisher likes to settle on a single source for each section, which would be fine if heâ€™d written a collection of profiles rather than a book billed as a comprehensive historical survey. Giving a history of Top 40 radio with only a single paragraph about the programmer Bill Drake (inventor of the hyperkinetic â€œBoss Radioâ€ù) is like writing a history of hit singles with only a single paragraph about Phil Spector. Writing about New York City radioâ€™s response to the arrival of the Beatles through the eyes of WABCâ€™s Bruce Morrow, without even mentioning â€œthe Fifth Beatle,â€ù WMCAâ€™s Murray the K, is just bizarre.,In his chapter on satellite radio, Fisher grows so fixed on the programmer Lee Abrams of XM that the rival Sirius network all but vanishes. (Disclosure: I am the host of a show on Sirius.) The chapter on shock jocks focuses so completely on Leykis that the portions on the much more important Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern (who gets only three pages) feel like intrusion.,Fisher has little to say about anything that happened outside the East Coast. B. Mitchell Reed, the great Los Angeles disc jockey who inspired Joni Mitchellâ€™s â€œYou Turn Me On, Iâ€™m a Radio,â€ù is mentioned only briefly, for his work in San Francisco. Thereâ€™s nothing about CKLW, in Windsor, Ontario, which was the No. 1 station in both Detroit and Cleveland for more than a decade. Wolfman Jack is mentioned for his role in â€œAmerican Graffitiâ€ù and his brief dalliance with WNBC in New York, but there is only a passing acknowledgment of his long career in Mexican border radio, which could be heard from San Antonio to Buffalo. Fisher adores late-night radio, but he says nothing about the legendary John R. and Hoss Allen of WLAC Nashville, who also had an audience across broad swaths of the nation.,Fisher describes how disco divided the rock radio audience and galvanized black and Latin listeners, who had been written off by FM rock radio, though he writes about such matters superficially. He claims that black disc jockeys simply â€œmimicked Top 40â€™s style,â€ù which I presume means he never heard Martha Jean the Queen, Butterball, Georgie Woods, the Magnificent Montague or, for that matter, the young Sly Stone. If anything, the mimicry ran in the other direction. Readers will finish â€œSomething in the Airâ€ù with no insight into how Spanish-language disc jockeys played the key role in delivering hundreds of thousands of immigration-rights supporters into the streets of Los Angeles and other cities last year, because Fisher says absolutely nothing about Latin radio in general and its crucial role in the Chicano community in particular. Turning out those demonstrators was a much greater accomplishment than the â€œRush Roomsâ€ù that sprang up in restaurants across the nation in Limbaughâ€™s heyday, which Fisher does mention.,Fisher provides a good deal of useful information about satellite and Internet broadcasting, and there are solid discussions of the consequences of the Federal Communications Commissionâ€™s laissez-faire policy toward fairness and community service and on the Clinton administrationâ€™s successful efforts to change the rules that prevented large corporations from owning large blocks of stations. He writes a devastating account of one of the focus groups that many big-city stations use to pick their playlists, arguing that such questionable research (each recording is judged by a seven-second sample) leads to unimaginative programming. He also has the courage to defend payola: â€œDespite the ugly underside of the promotion business,â€ù he writes, â€œthe old payola had a desirable result: a wider variety of music got on the air.â€ù,The problem, in the end, is the vastness and mutability of the radio culture that developed in the half-century since TV took over as the family hearth. Fisherâ€™s book is at its best when he lets himself speak about passions that are almost but not quite private: the importance of his first transistor radio; the way that radio and its successors blew musical winds of change into his life; the near magical effect of listening to someone who is committed not to playing good music or making political points but simply making good radio, whatever form it may take. In such moments, readers will find that they and Fisher have much to share â€” not as a generation, but simply as lovers of a medium that, however scorned and abused, retains its fascination.",DAVE MARSH,"JAN. 28, 2007",Radio Days,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Marsh.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When Thomas Hardy drew his first chancy breaths inside a Dorset cottage in 1840, Wordsworth had yet to become Englandâ€™s poet laureate. By his ninth decade, still writing, Hardy enjoyed listening to the wireless with his dog, Wessex, and had seen the silent-film adaptation of his own â€œTess of the Dâ€™Urbervilles.â€ù The authorâ€™s life span seems somehow even vaster than it was, a match for the cosmically long view Hardy took of his fictional characters, fateâ€™s playthings set in motion on a â€œblighted star.â€ù,His mother, Jemima, is described by Claire Tomalin in this excellent new biography as having been â€œpowerful, rather than tender,â€ù with a â€œdark streak of gloom and anger.â€ù A literate, book-hungry servant, Jemima had been exposed briefly to London life before her shotgun wedding to Hardyâ€™s father, a rural builder who proved, like his wife, a conscientious parent to their clever, undersize son, whom they provided with a nonconformist education and then apprenticed to an architect.,Much of Hardyâ€™s work in that early position derived from Englandâ€™s 19th-century vogue for â€œindiscriminate church restoration,â€ù an ahistorical endeavor he came to regret. From religion itself he never fell fully away, Tomalin argues. In the midst of his later meditations on the universeâ€™s blind cruelty, he â€œcherished the memory of belief,â€ù as if it were an original stone church underneath all the neo-Gothic gimcrackery.,Lucky enough to secure a place with Arthur Blomfield, â€œone of the most successful architects in London,â€ù Hardy nonetheless began seriously to pursue his ambition of becoming a novelist. Finding something to say about the manners, economics and morality of his society was hard enough work; convincing himself that he had the right to say it â€” at a time when his lack of property meant he was not entitled to vote â€” must have been an even taller order. Class was the vise in which he lived his early life, and Tomalin makes her readers feel the squeeze, as Hardy manages his slow rise into the middle class and then toward the upper echelons of authorship.,This new biography makes its subject a fascinating case study in mid-Victorian literary sociology. Hardy struggles â€” with an industriousness befitting the age â€” against editorial rejection, rapacious contract terms and enforced prudery. Leslie Stephen, known chiefly to the 21st century as Virginia Woolfâ€™s father, edited his magazine, The Cornhill, under the watchful, prissy eyes of so many others that he sometimes made â€œfew suggestions beyond bowdlerizationsâ€ù when working on Hardyâ€™s copy. Serialization often forced the author â€œto pack in far too much plotâ€ù and thereby throw novels like â€œThe Mayor of Casterbridgeâ€ù significantly off-kilter. Finally, there were reviewers to contend with; Hardy remained overly sensitive to all they had to say.,Tomalin herself examines the novels with the confident judgments of a critic, not the hedged and sometimes overawed appraisals of a scholar. Appreciative of Hardyâ€™s genius, she still finds his body of fiction â€œexceptionally uneven.â€ù â€œTess,â€ù the novel that made him rich, remains by Tomalinâ€™s measure an awkward production in spots, and yet it â€œglows with the intensityâ€ù of Hardyâ€™s imagination. In a fine example of biographyâ€™s usefulness to criticism, Tomalin notes that what Hardy called Tessâ€™s â€œinvincible instinct towards self-delightâ€ù was a quality the novelist â€œhimself possessed in very small measure,â€ù and thus, perhaps, judged all the more laudable in his heroine. â€œJude the Obscure,â€ù written when he was in his mid-50s, reprised Hardyâ€™s earliest â€œtheme of a penniless young man with ambitions and radical ideas.â€ù But so inexhaustible were his feelings on the subject that even today, as Tomalin puts it, â€œreading â€˜Judeâ€™ is like being hit in the face over and over again. ... It was Job retold for a godless world that offers no final consolation or redress.â€ù Reviews of the book were often scandalized and savage, and if they did not actually cause Hardy to abandon novels for poetry â€” something heâ€™d long wished to do â€” they seemed to provide him with the right moment. Having secured his place among the English novelists, he had 30 years left to write nothing but verse.,Hardy tended toward second thoughts and withdrawn behavior, as well as toward the sense of himself as a kind of living ghost: â€œEven when I enter into a room to pay a simple morning call I have unconsciously the habit of regarding the scene as if I were a spectre not solid enough to influence my environment.â€ù Many, like Virginia Woolf, were struck by his kindliness, and he insisted on calling himself an â€œevolutionary meliorist,â€ù not a pessimist. But Tomalin quotes an astonishing letter of condolence that he wrote when Henry Rider Haggard, the adventure writer, lost his 10-year-old son: â€œTo be candid, I think the death of a child is never really to be regretted, when one reflects on what he has escaped.â€ù,Hardyâ€™s long â€” and childless â€” marriage to Emma Gifford was marked by ever increasing estrangement and what Tomalin calls â€œmutual incomprehension.â€ù Emmaâ€™s liveliness and complicated nature had made her, early on, a kind of muse and â€œmineâ€ù â€” Hardyâ€™s own word â€” of material, but her own frustrated desire to write left her jealous of her husbandâ€™s success and even of his heroines. Annoyed by her habit of referring to â€œour books,â€ù Hardy worked hard at being both loyal and oblivious to her.,In the 1880s, two decades after he â€œset out to become a Londoner,â€ù he decided to return home to Dorset for good and build the house he called Max Gate; he took up residence and even served as a local justice of the peace. Emma did not favor the move but put up with it, as she put up with Hardyâ€™s attraction to the married Florence Henniker, a published novelist and the daughter of a lord, whose desire for friendship but not sex with Hardy helped inform his portrait of the neurotic Sue Bridehead in â€œJude.â€ù In 1905, when Hardy was 65, another Florence, Miss Dugdale, entered his and Emmaâ€™s life by means of a fan letter. She thoroughly insinuated herself into the Max Gate household and became the second Mrs. Hardy following Emmaâ€™s death in 1912. And yet, any humiliation from this would come to her, not Emma, when Hardy began to produce an extended series of questioning, penitential elegies for his first wife, the whole set of them racked with guilt and wonder.,Tomalin calls the Emma poems â€œone of the finest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry,â€ù shrewdly observing of their author: â€œThe more risks he takes the less he falters.â€ù The elegies have been strongly appreciated by other Hardy biographers (including Martin Seymour-Smith a dozen years ago) but perhaps never so convincingly as they are by Tomalin, who chooses to begin her bookâ€™s prologue with Emmaâ€™s death, what she calls â€œthe moment when Thomas Hardy became a great poet.â€ù To those, like this reviewer, who have always thought Hardy as unwise to have given up fiction as George Meredith was to neglect poetry, even for a time, Tomalinâ€™s treatment of the Emma poems prompts at least a tentative reconsideration. What she sees as â€œthe contradictions always present in Hardy, between the vulnerable, doomstruck man and the serene inhabitant of the natural worldâ€ù may actually have been better conveyed by verse, which allows the clashing elements a lyric near-simultaneity, something unachievable in the slower alternations of narrative fiction.,Surely, at points in writing this biography, Tomalin must have pined for the subject of her previous one, Samuel Pepys, whose whole exuberant existence derived from an â€œinstinct towards self-delightâ€ù such as even Tess never knew. Nonetheless, Tomalin comes through, recounting Hardyâ€™s life with the amiable authority of a 19th-century novelist, unafraid of gentle, but firm, pronouncements (â€œLike most people, he gave different accounts of what he believed at different timesâ€ù). She has visited each important locale of Hardyâ€™s life, noticing the large and seemingly simple things academic scholars often miss: â€œMost of his characters are prodigious walkers. Tess and Jude both walk themselves through the crises in their lives, and Jude effectively kills himself by walking in the rain.â€ù This is an observation that helps readers to square the circle of recognitions, to remember Hardy as a writer whose books they would once finish with the sudden need to get up from the chair and out of the house, to walk, alone, filled with the ancient surefire feelings of pity and fear.",THOMAS MALLON,"JAN. 28, 2007",Thomas Hardyâ€™s English Lessons,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Mallon.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before Hart Craneâ€™s leap into the Caribbean that fatal April noon in 1932, he folded his jacket over the shipâ€™s rail with impeccable manners. Striking out into the glassy sea, he was seen no more, dying younger than Byron but older than Shelley. Not being a seagoing breed, poets rarely die by water â€” Shelley drowned in a sudden squall; but he had written 1,500 pages of poetry, while Crane left only two very short books and the shards of a third. The hope for a homegrown American epic that died with him has never entirely revived.,The precocious son of a wealthy Cleveland candy manufacturer (Craneâ€™s father created the Life Saver mint but sold the rights cheap), Crane dropped out of high school and persuaded his parents to send him to New York, where he hoped to make his way as a writer. Wearing the scarlet A of ambition, at 17 he confidently predicted that he would â€œreally without doubt be one of the foremost poets in America.â€ù In fact, Crane was soon published in some of the best little magazines. He impressed his friends, not just with his bulb-eyed and brutish good looks (thereâ€™s always room in New York for a handsome boy with manners and a wild streak), but with his canny critical judgment. He was a fan of Pound before â€œThe Cantosâ€ù and Joyce before â€œUlysses,â€ù and was terrified by Eliot before â€œThe Waste Land.â€ù As early as 1920 he was recommending, before either had published a book, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore, whom he referred to as â€œMarionâ€ù (Craneâ€™s deranged spelling offers one of the quiet comedies of the new Library of America edition of his work).,Most of Craneâ€™s short life was spent scuffling for money. His tightfisted father kept him on an allowance at first, but expected Crane to get a job. The poet tried various fits and shifts, finding employment most frequently in advertising (writing copy for, among other things, a new synthetic leather called Naugahyde), though at times he was forced back to Ohio, where he spent an unhappy Christmas selling candy from an Akron drugstore counter. No doubt his father saw this as his sonâ€™s first step toward inheriting the family business, but the experiment was not a success.,Craneâ€™s early poems showed more style than talent, and from the start he was attracted to an obscurity that left some readers cold:,It helps only a little to know that this dreadful mess was called â€œChaplinesque.â€ù One of Craneâ€™s friends later knocked on his door with Charlie Chaplin in tow, and the three went out on the town until dawn. Having learned this, a hundred American poets will begin odes to Angelina Jolie.,Crane was mystified, as most obscure poets are, when readers found his poems difficult â€” after all, they were perfectly clear to him. His obscurity was not that of Eliot or Pound, not a layered and allusive language whose intrigues deepened the more one examined it. Craneâ€™s language, when not a matter of tangled metaphors (he mixed them almost more often than he mixed drinks), was a schoolboy code for which an English-Fustian, Fustian-English dictionary would have proved helpful. He came by his obscurity honestly â€” he didnâ€™t read Gerard Manley Hopkins, whose style might have influenced him, until far too late. When you clear away the clutter from his verse, often you find only banalities â€” Crane flinched from Eliotâ€™s dour observations and pince-nez disillusion, wanting to embody a rhapsodic vision of poetry it was difficult not to glaze with sentiment.,Crane tried on various identities as a young man and failed at most of them. He was frank about his homosexuality only with close friends â€” his sexual appetites were voracious and involved far too many sailors. (The definitive work on the United States Navyâ€™s contributions to cruising has yet to be written.) Crane dreamed of being a poet much more often than he sat at his desk and wrote poems; and he was forever complaining in letters that he had no time to write, though he found plenty of time to drink. He conceived his major poem, â€œThe Bridge,â€ù as early as 1923 but made only desultory progress toward it. (Remaining drunk all through Prohibition proved surprisingly easy.) It was hard work, avoiding real work; but Crane became an expert at writing cadging letters to his divorced parents and playing one against the other.,Forever broke, dramatically threatening to slave away on the docks or drive a truck, Crane took to writing begging letters to millionaires, or at least one millionaire, and got lucky. The financier Otto Kahn, the major shareholder in the Metropolitan Opera, offered to loan him $2,000 to write â€œThe Bridgeâ€ù (Kahn also backed Gershwin and Eisenstein). The poet was soon ensconced in a shabby house in upstate New York, spending his benefactorâ€™s initial installment as if it would last forever (on snowshoes, as well as wood carvings from the Congo, among other things) and asking for advances on the remainder. Kahn hardly lacked the wherewithal â€” his fireproof castle on Long Island grew to 100,000 square feet, and his 80-room Fifth Avenue mansion was stuffed with old masters.,Crane usually bit the hand that fed him, but you have to like a poet whose revelation of his own genius occurred in a dentistâ€™s chair (â€œAn objective voice kept saying to me â€” â€˜You have the higher consciousness. ... This is what is called geniusâ€™ â€ù). He told his father that critics believed his first book, â€œWhite Buildingsâ€ù (1926), would be the most important debut in American poetry since â€œLeaves of Grass.â€ù These critics, who happened to be his friends, loyally judged him by the poems he had yet to write.,Chronically out of sorts, creatively ill (his life would have been far happier after the introduction of decongestants), prone to â€œenthusiasmsâ€ù we might now call mania, argumentative, often spectacularly drunk, Crane would have gotten on anyoneâ€™s nerves. He had spent most of the millionaireâ€™s thousands when he departed abruptly for his motherâ€™s ramshackle plantation off Cuba (his family owned houses all over the place). There, after much grouching and complaint, he completed half of â€œThe Bridge,â€ù which he saw not as an epic but as a â€œlong lyric poem, with interrelated sections.â€ù,It would take Crane three more years to finish the poem, spending months in California as companion to a neurasthenic stockbroker, squandering an inheritance from his grandmother on a trip to Paris, his drunkenness meanwhile growing wilder and more uncontrollable. When â€œThe Bridgeâ€ù was finally published in 1930, Crane felt betrayed by the mixed reviews it received from Allen Tate and Yvor Winters, his old friends, who had begun to have second thoughts, not about Craneâ€™s gifts, but about his ability to profit from them.,Much of â€œThe Bridgeâ€ù seems inert now â€”overlong, overbearing, overwrought, a Myth of America conceived by Tiffany and executed by Disney. Crane imagined the Brooklyn Bridge as a mystical symbol for art, for history, for America, for any old thing; in this spiritual version of Manifest Destiny, he threw his poem backward to Columbus and worked forward to the invention of the airplane. The canvas was broad, but its success would have required a language less Alexandrian than Crane possessed. At his best, he stayed just this side of wild-eyed prophesying, though his grandeurs might easily be mistaken for grandiosity:,This is a beautifully managed passage; but even Craneâ€™s most thrilling lines can be cloying, always an adjective too rich or a noun too boisterous, the most beautiful stanzas naÃ¯ve as history or infused with a crude faith in progress almost embarrassing now. He was drawn to a high-amp schmaltziness he must have taken as the proper emotional tone for a visionary.,Crane wanted to drag the language of Marlowe and Webster into the Jazz Age. Beneath his jewel-encrusted lines, however, the poem seems trivial, its ideas torn from the daily paper or the pages of a high-school history textbook:,We have no long poems this close to being great that are greater failures. (Why do American poets so often lose their bearings, and their taste, when writing about America?) The poemâ€™s creaky swiveling through time, its brassy versifying and its phony demotic seem dated now, not because Crane was heavily indebted to â€œThe Waste Landâ€ù (despite frequently disparaging Eliot), but because he learned so little from it. Reading â€œThe Bridgeâ€ù is like being stuck in a mawkish medley from â€œShow Boatâ€ù and â€œOklahomaâ€ù â€” youâ€™d buy the Brooklyn Bridge to make it stop. Critics since have tried to make a case for the poem, for the coherence of its incoherent parts (criticism, like poetry, is often wishful thinking); but â€œThe Bridgeâ€ù remains a fabulous architectural blueprint that wanted a discipline Crane could never provide.,The poetâ€™s last year was spent on a Guggenheim fellowship in Mexico (we are lucky he left nothing of his projected epic on the Aztecs). He behaved so badly that his friend Katherine Anne Porter ratted him out to the foundation, which almost terminated the fellowship. In his final months, exhausted and miserable, he began an affair with Malcolm Cowleyâ€™s estranged wife, an older woman Crane called â€œTwidget,â€ù and wrote a homosexual friend that he had â€œbroken ranksâ€ù with the â€œbrotherhood.â€ù Perhaps the romance was merely a sign of his boredom and mental exhaustion â€” it did nothing to slow down his secret pickups and Jack Tar chasing.,The Library of America edition, edited by Langdon Hammer, contains more of Crane than most readers will ever need. The poems take up so little space, this well-edited volume has been pieced out with more than 500 pages of letters (Crane was an energetic correspondent though rarely one memorable or even bearable â€” great ones donâ€™t usually whine so much). E. E. Cummings once remarked that Craneâ€™s mind was â€œno bigger than a pinâ€ù; but Crane had a sharp critical temperament that appears to best advantage in his letters: â€œGod DAMN this constant nostalgia for something always â€˜new,â€™ â€ù he wrote, and â€œI detest a certain narcissism in the voluptuous melancholics of Eliot.â€ù The editionâ€™s scattershot notes are helpful, but the chronology of Craneâ€™s life averts its gaze from his athletic philandering and the exact events leading to his suicide â€” he had been badly beaten during the night by a sailor he propositioned.,Crane still makes young men want to write poetry â€” his best lines are extraordinary, even if there are few major poems, or even very good ones. He failed to write the poetry of the American continent Emerson was calling for before the Civil War: if the ideal seems naÃ¯vely nationalistic now, the country was once younger and less cynical. Crane was no innovative genius like Whitman; he was perhaps closer to a peasant poet like John Clare, an outsider too susceptible to praise and other vices of the city. Defensive about his lack of education, a Midwestern striver out of a Sinclair Lewis novel, Crane tried to make it among the big-city literary men, gripping a rum in one hand and a copy of â€œThe Waste Landâ€ù in the other. Had beauty been enough, he might even have succeeded.",WILLIAM LOGAN,"JAN. 28, 2007",Hart Craneâ€™s Bridge to Nowhere,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Logan.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" What would you rather write this year, if you could: a great, lasting pop song or a strong but unmemorable novel? That question came up at dinner, in a loud downtown restaurant, about a decade ago. I was there, as were two novelists: one has gone on to win major awards and become well known, the other hasnâ€™t but deserves to. It was late; there were wine bottles; you could still smoke inside. Iâ€™d thrown out the question after hearing something good â€” was it â€œ(Donâ€™t Go Back to) Rockvilleâ€ù? â€” on the sound system. But these guys went at the question as if their lives depended on it. The debate quickly ratcheted up from the fundamental worth of, say, Brian Wilsonâ€™s work versus J. D. Salingerâ€™s to Beethovenâ€™s versus Tolstoyâ€™s. I canâ€™t remember who won. But punches were on the verge of being thrown. And I dimly recall thinking I should hide the pointy silverware., Why is music so potent, anyway? Two recent books that have flirted with making this list â€” Daniel J. Levitinâ€™s â€œThis Is Your Brain on Musicâ€ù and a paperback called â€œRock the SATâ€ù â€” skulk around that question. Levitinâ€™s is a real, and very readable, book. Heâ€™s a former music producer (Chris Isaak, Blue Oyster Cult) who runs the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University. But the people behind â€œRock the SATâ€ù are putting his ideas into action, promising teenagers they can â€œtrick your brain into learning vocab while listening to slamming music.â€ù Cole Porter, this ainâ€™t.

"In this tender, slender, fictionalized memoir, Wendell Berry adds another chapter to his continuing account of rural life in Kentucky. The novelâ€™s town of Port William, as his elderly narrator explains, looking back to his childhood during World War II, is â€œthe nucleus, the navel, of the country that was most intimately home to me then and has been home to me all my life, even in the years when I did not live in it. It is my motherland, the mold I was cast in.â€ù,Embarking alone on a gentle rite of passage, 9-year-old Andy Catlett boards a bus, going off to see his two sets of grandparents, who live about 10 miles from his home. What the grown-up Andy recalls of that experience is transformed into â€œa sort of homageâ€ù to a now-vanished world. Title characters from Berryâ€™s earlier Port William volumes â€” Jayber Crow, Old Jack, Hannah Coulter â€” appear here in affectionate cameos as the adult Andy, echoing Wordsworth, observes that â€œin my memory, all who were there ... seem now to be gathered into a love that is at once a boyâ€™s and an aging manâ€™s.â€ù,When those perspectives are fused, the novel has an elemental beauty. Berry, who is also a poet, writes sensuously of Grandma and Grandpa Catlettâ€™s house, which â€œclicked and ticked in the nighttime cold.â€ù He describes Grandpa Catlett sitting in his armchair, thinking about the people heâ€™d known when he was a boy, considering â€œthe history of his hands,â€ù which â€œwere hard-used and now almost useless.â€ù,As though describing a painting by Edward Hopper, Berry captures the mood of a general store abandoned by its owner, who has gone off to join the Army: â€œEvery shelf and bin and counter was as bare of goods as Mother Hubbardâ€™s cupboard. The store contained only its share of the surrounding stillness, and the light starkly shaped and shadowed by the deserted furnishings.â€ù,Sometimes, though, the aging man, not so much reflective as opinionated, crowds out his younger self. Berry has long lived and farmed in Port Royal, Ky., and his eloquent essays on honoring and working the land have been a vital force in the modern agrarian movement. Here, though, he lets Andy reach hasty conclusions, never allowing readers to understand what shocks or revelations have made this character go sour on change.,After relishing his memories of the daily toil on Grandpa Catlettâ€™s farm, Andy sounds cantankerous when he announces that â€œin only a few years the world of pavement, speed and universal dissatisfaction had extended itself into nearly every place and nearly every mind, and the old world of the mule team and wagon was simply gone, leaving behind it a scatter of less and less intelligible relics.â€ù Remembering his other grandparents, the Feltners, Andy seems not so much visionary as dyspeptic, warning about the dangers of forgetting â€œthe timely world of nature or the eternal world of the prophets and poets. And I fear, I believe I know, that the doom of the older world I knew as a boy will finally afflict the new one that replaced it.â€ù,Thankfully, in other passages the spirit of the young Andy â€” and his sense of wonder â€” prevail. In an early essay called â€œA Native Hill,â€ù Berry concluded that his probing questions about his life and its relation to his native land â€” â€œso full of my own history and so much damaged by itâ€ù â€” could only be answered â€œin partial and fragmentary ways.â€ù â€œAndy Catlett: Early Travelsâ€ù is one of those many fragments. Richly drawn, if jagged, itâ€™s best seen as a small part of a puzzle most illuminating when all pieced together.",ROY HOFFMAN,"JAN. 28, 2007",Boy on the Bus,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/books/review/Hoffman.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THERE is evidently something in theBritish character that relishes a reallysolid military reverse. Many morehearts, among the island race, are setpounding by the gallant fiasco of the LightBrigade than even by Waterloo or Trafalgar.George MacDonald Fraser has made a fortuneout of chronicling the numberless heroic drubbingsto which, from Afghanistan to Zululand,British armies have been subjected. Nobodycan quite decide whether the Somme in 1916was a victory or a defeat, because some thingsindeed do lie too deep for tears.,It is not as if the British dwell too muchon their humiliations (Singapore and Suezare often passed over in a gruff silence). Perhapsit just seems bad form to celebrate oneâ€™svictories too much â€” unless of course theyare attained just as the bloody jaws of defeatare about to snap shut. Then, every spine isstraightened and we are back at Agincourt, ona sticky wicket somewhere in France but withthe home island not all that far away.,The absolutely critical moment in Shakespeareâ€™saccount comes with King Henryâ€™s replyto the enemyâ€™s herald. Young Harry knowsthat his army is awash with pox and diarrheaand otherwise in thoroughly bad shape. â€œWewould not seek a battle, as we are,â€ù he confessesto Montjoy. But then comes the spine-stiffener.â€œNor, as we are, we say, we will not shun it.â€ù,This came back to me with particular forceas I turned the pages of â€œDunkirk,â€ù Hugh Sebag-Montefioreâ€™s first-rate panoramic history, andhighly affecting wormâ€™s-eye account, of Britainâ€™sabsolutely all-time favorite disaster. Hasthere ever been a more obviously foredoomedmilitary escapade (for once one can employthe word accurately) than the dispatch, forthe second time in a quarter-century, of a BritishExpeditionary Force to defend Belgiumand France from German expansionism? Thename given to the army was suggestive of thetentative and the improvised, as if its very presenceon the European mainland was somethingrather out-of-the-way and short-term. As indeedit proved to be: the chief historic achievement ofthe B.E.F. was to have got itself home again, ifnot quite in one piece. Sebag-Montefiore, the authorof â€œEnigma: The Battle for the Code,â€ù helpsamplify and redeem the sad story, though, bytelling us of those who followed the terse orderthat is contained in his subtitle, and who therebymade that great escape possible.,The authorâ€™s own cousin, Denzil Sebag-Montefiore, may have been one of the few Jewishplatoon commanders on those gruesome beaches,but like Siegfried Sassoon before him, he conductedhimself with distinctive insouciance. Heshared his Fortnum & Mason food hamper withhis men, who repaid the kindness by heaving himinto a boat (after he had lightened himself bytossing away his engraved ivory hairbrushes).,The book is replete with the exploits ofdouble- and triple-barrel names: Lt. Col. LionelBootle-Wilbraham marvels at the speed withwhich British soldiers disappear into brothels.Maj. Reggie Alston-Roberts-West teams upwith the Duke of Northumberland and finds alieutenant of the Grenadier Guards, with the titleMaster of Forbes, badly wounded. They draghim away, â€œrather like a dead stag is pulled offthe hill by its antlers.â€ù Brig. M. B. Beckwith-Smith offers Â£5 to any of his gunners who canbring down a Nazi dive- bomber, adding the advicethat those aiming should â€œtake them like ahigh pheasant.â€ù Itâ€™s a bit like crossing Sassoonwith Anthony Powell, and finding upper-crustfox hunters and deerstalkers chivying theirway through shell-holes.,â€œI managed to have a word with Fat BoyGort,â€ù says Nick Jenkinsâ€™s officer-class fatherin Powellâ€™s â€œphony warâ€ù novel, â€œThe KindlyOnesâ€ù â€” a book that gives a beautifully understatedsense of the impending shambles. In reality,Lord Gort, the commander of the B.E.F.,had perhaps the least enviable of all jobs. Hehad to lead a dismally unprepared force acrossto France, then contend every day with Frenchand Belgian, not to mention British, politics.The particular brilliance of this book lies in themanner in which Sebag-Montefiore interleavesthe military with the political.,In a vertiginous space of time, the wretchedlyequipped B.E.F. was forced to deal withexorbitant demands from Paris that the Frenchessentially be lent the bulk of the RoyalAir Force; with a cowardly sellout ontheir left flank by King Leopold of Belgium;and with intelligence from Germansources (in one case anti-Nazi andin one case not) about the precise datewhen Generals Guderian and Rommelwould roll forward and carry the swastikaflag into the Low Countries. As ifthis were not enough, the war cabinetin London, still reeling from the easewith which Hitler had defeated anotherBritish â€œexpeditionâ€ù to Norway, was seriouslyentertaining a proposal of â€œmediationâ€ùfrom Benito Mussolini. ( I findit somehow humiliating â€” no, makethat nauseating â€” even to have to readabout this latter episode.),By the time Churchill and ClementAttlee had outpointed Chamberlain andHalifax and the other capitulationistsand formed a serious government, it wasprobably already too late. Churchillâ€™sown memoirs give the most hauntingaccount of the moment of truth. Seeingthe dispiriting picture on the map whenhe flew to Paris in the middle of May1940, he turned to Gen. Maurice Gamelinto ask where his reserves were andreceived the bleak one-word responseâ€œAucuneâ€ù â€” there werenâ€™t any. Throughthe window, Churchill suddenly noticedthat the evacuation of the Quai dâ€™Orsaywas already in rapid progress.,To say the flight from Dunkirkplaced the Entente Cordiale under considerablestrain is to say the least of it.By the end, British soldiers were simplypushing their French counterparts overthe side in the scramble for the boats.(It also wouldnâ€™t be very long beforeChurchill gave the order, still hugelyresented in France, for the Royal Navyto sink the French fleet in the Algerianport of Oran, lest it even consider surrenderingto Hitler.) There were other appallingscenes of panic and misery on Dunkirkâ€™s beaches,recently and grimly reconstructed by IanMcEwan in his novel â€œAtonement,â€ù as exhaustedsoldiers endured leisurely German strafingand cursed the absence of the R.A.F. The wholebitterness and shame was somewhat annealedin the public mind by the little volunteer vesselsthat poured across from England to take offsurvivors, but Sebag-Montefiore is unsparingin his description of the crack-ups, shell-shockand drunkenness that sometimes seemed endemicamong these rescuers. Churchill himselfwas sufficiently alarmed by the euphoria overthe whole calamity to remind his listeners thatwars are not won by evacuations.,It was quite late in the day when a detachmentof the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshireregiment (the â€œOx and Bucksâ€ù ) were told of theorder to â€œfight to the last man, to the last round. â€ùAnd so many of them did, even though they knewthe cause was lost and that many of their comradeswere embarking for England. These menpurchased necessary time in the hardest possiblecurrency. Judging by some of the diariesand letters cited by Sebag-Montefiore, about theprostitutes and wine-cellars of the region, manyof the English soldiery were as poxed and shakyas King Henryâ€™s legendary rabble.

"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.,That, more or less, is the short answer to the supposedly incredibly complicated and confusing question of what we humans should eat in order to be maximally healthy. I hate to give away the game right here at the beginning of a long essay, and I confess that Iâ€™m tempted to complicate matters in the interest of keeping things going for a few thousand more words. Iâ€™ll try to resist but will go ahead and add a couple more details to flesh out the advice. Like: A little meat wonâ€™t kill you, though itâ€™s better approached as a side dish than as a main. And youâ€™re much better off eating whole fresh foods than processed food products. Thatâ€™s what I mean by the recommendation to eat â€œfood.â€ù Once, food was all you could eat, but today there are lots of other edible foodlike substances in the supermarket. These novel products of food science often come in packages festooned with health claims, which brings me to a related rule of thumb: if youâ€™re concerned about your health, you should probably avoid food products that make health claims. Why? Because a health claim on a food product is a good indication that itâ€™s not really food, and food is what you want to eat.,Uh-oh. Things are suddenly sounding a little more complicated, arenâ€™t they? Sorry. But thatâ€™s how it goes as soon as you try to get to the bottom of the whole vexing question of food and health. Before long, a dense cloud bank of confusion moves in. Sooner or later, everything solid you thought you knew about the links between , and health gets blown away in the gust of the latest study.,Last winter came the news that a low-fat diet, long believed to protect against ,, may do no such thing â€” this from the monumental, federally financed Womenâ€™s Health Initiative, which has also found no link between a low-fat diet and rates of ,. The year before we learned that dietary fiber might not, as we had been confidently told, help prevent colon ,. Just last fall two prestigious studies on omega-3 fats published at the same time presented us with strikingly different conclusions. While the Institute of Medicine stated that â€œit is uncertain how much these omega-3s contribute to improving healthâ€ù (and they might do the opposite if you get them from mercury-contaminated fish), a Harvard study declared that simply by eating a couple of servings of fish each week (or by downing enough fish oil), you could cut your risk of dying from a heart attack by more than a third â€” a stunningly hopeful piece of news. Itâ€™s no wonder that omega-3 fatty acids are poised to become the oat bran of 2007, as food scientists micro-encapsulate fish oil and algae oil and blast them into such formerly all-terrestrial foods as bread and tortillas, milk and yogurt and cheese, all of which will soon, you can be sure, sprout fishy new health claims. (Remember the rule?),By now youâ€™re probably registering the cognitive dissonance of the supermarket shopper or science-section reader, as well as some nostalgia for the simplicity and solidity of the first few sentences of this essay. Which Iâ€™m still prepared to defend against the shifting winds of nutritional science and food-industry marketing. But before I do that, it might be useful to figure out how we arrived at our present state of nutritional confusion and anxiety.,The story of how the most basic questions about what to eat ever got so complicated reveals a great deal about the institutional imperatives of the food industry, nutritional science and â€” ahem â€” journalism, three parties that stand to gain much from widespread confusion surrounding what is, after all, the most elemental question an omnivore confronts. Humans deciding what to eat without expert help â€” something they have been doing with notable success since coming down out of the trees â€” is seriously unprofitable if youâ€™re a food company, distinctly risky if youâ€™re a nutritionist and just plain boring if youâ€™re a newspaper editor or journalist. (Or, for that matter, an eater. Who wants to hear, yet again, â€œEat more fruits and vegetablesâ€ù?) And so, like a large gray fog, a great Conspiracy of Confusion has gathered around the simplest questions of nutrition â€” much to the advantage of everybody involved. Except perhaps the ostensible beneficiary of all this nutritional expertise and advice: us, and our health and happiness as eaters.,FROM FOODS TO NUTRIENTS,It was in the 1980s that food began disappearing from the American supermarket, gradually to be replaced by â€œnutrients,â€ù which are not the same thing. Where once the familiar names of recognizable comestibles â€” things like eggs or breakfast cereal or cookies â€” claimed pride of place on the brightly colored packages crowding the aisles, now new terms like â€œfiberâ€ù and â€œ,â€ù and â€œsaturated fatâ€ù rose to large-type prominence. More important than mere foods, the presence or absence of these invisible substances was now generally believed to confer health benefits on their eaters. Foods by comparison were coarse, old-fashioned and decidedly unscientific things â€” who could say what was in them, really? But nutrients â€” those chemical compounds and minerals in foods that nutritionists have deemed important to health â€” gleamed with the promise of scientific certainty; eat more of the right ones, fewer of the wrong, and you would live longer and avoid chronic diseases.,Nutrients themselves had been around, as a concept, since the early 19th century, when the English doctor and chemist William Prout identified what came to be called the â€œmacronutrientsâ€ù: protein, fat and carbohydrates. It was thought that that was pretty much all there was going on in food, until doctors noticed that an adequate supply of the big three did not necessarily keep people nourished. At the end of the 19th century, British doctors were puzzled by the fact that Chinese laborers in the Malay states were dying of a disease called beriberi, which didnâ€™t seem to afflict Tamils or native Malays. The mystery was solved when someone pointed out that the Chinese ate â€œpolished,â€ù or white, rice, while the others ate rice that hadnâ€™t been mechanically milled. A few years later, Casimir Funk, a Polish chemist, discovered the â€œessential nutrientâ€ù in rice husks that protected against beriberi and called it a â€œvitamine,â€ù the first micronutrient. , brought a kind of glamour to the science of nutrition, and though certain sectors of the population began to eat by its expert lights, it really wasnâ€™t until late in the 20th century that nutrients managed to push food aside in the popular imagination of what it means to eat.,No single event marked the shift from eating food to eating nutrients, though in retrospect a little-noticed political dust-up in Washington in 1977 seems to have helped propel American food culture down this dimly lighted path. Responding to an alarming increase in chronic diseases linked to diet â€” including heart disease, cancer and , â€” a Senate Select Committee on Nutrition, headed by George McGovern, held hearings on the problem and prepared what by all rights should have been an uncontroversial document called â€œDietary Goals for the United States.â€ù The committee learned that while rates of coronary heart disease had soared in America since World War II, other cultures that consumed traditional diets based largely on plants had strikingly low rates of chronic disease. Epidemiologists also had observed that in America during the war years, when meat and dairy products were strictly rationed, the rate of heart disease temporarily plummeted.,NaÃ¯vely putting two and two together, the committee drafted a straightforward set of dietary guidelines calling on Americans to cut down on red meat and dairy products. Within weeks a firestorm, emanating from the red-meat and dairy industries, engulfed the committee, and Senator McGovern (who had a great many cattle ranchers among his South Dakota constituents) was forced to beat a retreat. The committeeâ€™s recommendations were hastily rewritten. Plain talk about food â€” the committee had advised Americans to actually â€œreduce consumption of meatâ€ù â€” was replaced by artful compromise: â€œChoose meats, poultry and fish that will reduce saturated-fat intake.â€ù,A subtle change in emphasis, you might say, but a world of difference just the same. First, the stark message to â€œeat lessâ€ù of a particular food has been deep-sixed; donâ€™t look for it ever again in any official U.S. dietary pronouncement. Second, notice how distinctions between entities as different as fish and beef and chicken have collapsed; those three venerable foods, each representing an entirely different taxonomic class, are now lumped together as delivery systems for a single nutrient. Notice too how the new language exonerates the foods themselves; now the culprit is an obscure, invisible, tasteless â€” and politically unconnected â€” substance that may or may not lurk in them called â€œsaturated fat.â€ù,The linguistic capitulation did nothing to rescue McGovern from his blunder; the very next election, in 1980, the beef lobby helped rusticate the three-term senator, sending an unmistakable warning to anyone who would challenge the American diet, and in particular the big chunk of animal protein sitting in the middle of its plate. Henceforth, government dietary guidelines would shun plain talk about whole foods, each of which has its trade association on Capitol Hill, and would instead arrive clothed in scientific euphemism and speaking of nutrients, entities that few Americans really understood but that lack powerful lobbies in Washington. This was precisely the tack taken by the National Academy of Sciences when it issued its landmark report on diet and cancer in 1982. Organized nutrient by nutrient in a way guaranteed to offend no food group, it codified the official new dietary language. Industry and media followed suit, and terms like polyunsaturated, cholesterol, monounsaturated, carbohydrate, fiber, polyphenols, amino acids and carotenes soon colonized much of the cultural space previously occupied by the tangible substance formerly known as food. The Age of Nutritionism had arrived.,THE RISE OF NUTRITIONISM,The first thing to understand about nutritionism â€” I first encountered the term in the work of an Australian sociologist of science named Gyorgy Scrinis â€” is that it is not quite the same as nutrition. As the â€œismâ€ù suggests, it is not a scientific subject but an ideology. Ideologies are ways of organizing large swaths of life and experience under a set of shared but unexamined assumptions. This quality makes an ideology particularly hard to see, at least while itâ€™s exerting its hold on your culture. A reigning ideology is a little like the weather, all pervasive and virtually inescapable. Still, we can try.,In the case of nutritionism, the widely shared but unexamined assumption is that the key to understanding food is indeed the nutrient. From this basic premise flow several others. Since nutrients, as compared with foods, are invisible and therefore slightly mysterious, it falls to the scientists (and to the journalists through whom the scientists speak) to explain the hidden reality of foods to us. To enter a world in which you dine on unseen nutrients, you need lots of expert help.,But expert help to do what, exactly? This brings us to another unexamined assumption: that the whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. Hippocratesâ€™s famous injunction to â€œlet food be thy medicineâ€ù is ritually invoked to support this notion. Iâ€™ll leave the premise alone for now, except to point out that it is not shared by all cultures and that the experience of these other cultures suggests that, paradoxically, viewing food as being about things other than bodily health â€” like pleasure, say, or socializing â€” makes people no less healthy; indeed, thereâ€™s some reason to believe that it may make them more healthy. This is what we usually have in mind when we speak of the â€œFrench paradoxâ€ù â€” the fact that a population that eats all sorts of unhealthful nutrients is in many ways healthier than we Americans are. So there is at least a question as to whether nutritionism is actually any good for you.,Another potentially serious weakness of nutritionist ideology is that it has trouble discerning qualitative distinctions between foods. So fish, beef and chicken through the nutritionistsâ€™ lens become mere delivery systems for varying quantities of fats and proteins and whatever other nutrients are on their scope. Similarly, any qualitative distinctions between processed foods and whole foods disappear when your focus is on quantifying the nutrients they contain (or, more precisely, the known nutrients).,This is a great boon for manufacturers of processed food, and it helps explain why they have been so happy to get with the nutritionism program. In the years following McGovernâ€™s capitulation and the 1982 National Academy report, the food industry set about re-engineering thousands of popular food products to contain more of the nutrients that science and government had deemed the good ones and less of the bad, and by the late â€™80s a golden era of food science was upon us. The Year of Eating Oat Bran â€” also known as 1988 â€” served as a kind of coming-out party for the food scientists, who succeeded in getting the material into nearly every processed food sold in America. Oat branâ€™s moment on the dietary stage didnâ€™t last long, but the pattern had been established, and every few years since then a new oat bran has taken its turn under the marketing lights. (Here comes omega-3!),By comparison, the typical real food has more trouble competing under the rules of nutritionism, if only because something like a banana or an avocado canâ€™t easily change its nutritional stripes (though rest assured the genetic engineers are hard at work on the problem). So far, at least, you canâ€™t put oat bran in a banana. So depending on the reigning nutritional orthodoxy, the avocado might be either a high-fat food to be avoided (Old Think) or a food high in monounsaturated fat to be embraced (New Think). The fate of each whole food rises and falls with every change in the nutritional weather, while the processed foods are simply reformulated. Thatâ€™s why when the Atkins mania hit the food industry, bread and pasta were given a quick redesign (dialing back the carbs; boosting the protein), while the poor unreconstructed potatoes and carrots were left out in the cold.,Of course itâ€™s also a lot easier to slap a health claim on a box of sugary cereal than on a potato or carrot, with the perverse result that the most healthful foods in the supermarket sit there quietly in the produce section, silent as ,, while a few aisles over, the Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms are screaming about their newfound whole-grain goodness.,EAT RIGHT, GET FATTER,So nutritionism is good for business. But is it good for us? You might think that a national fixation on nutrients would lead to measurable improvements in the public health. But for that to happen, the underlying nutritional science, as well as the policy recommendations (and the journalism) based on that science, would have to be sound. This has seldom been the case.,Consider what happened immediately after the 1977 â€œDietary Goalsâ€ù â€” McGovernâ€™s masterpiece of politico-nutritionist compromise. In the wake of the panelâ€™s recommendation that we cut down on saturated fat, a recommendation seconded by the 1982 National Academy report on cancer, Americans did indeed change their diets, endeavoring for a quarter-century to do what they had been told. Well, kind of. The industrial food supply was promptly reformulated to reflect the official advice, giving us low-fat pork, low-fat Snackwellâ€™s and all the low-fat pasta and high-fructose (yet low-fat!) corn syrup we could consume. Which turned out to be quite a lot. Oddly, America got really fat on its new low-fat diet â€” indeed, many date the current , and diabetes epidemic to the late 1970s, when Americans began binging on carbohydrates, ostensibly as a way to avoid the evils of fat.,This story has been told before, notably in these pages (â€œ,â€ù by Gary Taubes, July 7, 2002), but itâ€™s   a little more complicated than the official version suggests. In that version,   which inspired the most recent Atkins craze, we were told that America got fat   when, responding to bad scientific advice, it shifted its diet from fats to   carbs, suggesting that a re-evaluation of the two nutrients is in order: fat   doesnâ€™t make you fat; carbs do. (Why this should have come as news is a mystery:   as long as people have been raising animals for food, they have fattened them   on carbs.),But there are a couple of problems with this revisionist picture. First, while it is true that Americans post-1977 did begin binging on carbs, and that fat as a percentage of total calories in the American diet declined, we never did in fact cut down on our consumption of fat. Meat consumption actually climbed. We just heaped a bunch more carbs onto our plates, obscuring perhaps, but not replacing, the expanding chunk of animal protein squatting in the center.,How did that happen? I would submit that the ideology of nutritionism deserves as much of the blame as the carbohydrates themselves do â€” that and human nature. By framing dietary advice in terms of good and bad nutrients, and by burying the recommendation that we should eat less of any particular food, it was easy for the take-home message of the 1977 and 1982 dietary guidelines to be simplified as follows: Eat more low-fat foods. And that is what we did. Weâ€™re always happy to receive a dispensation to eat more of something (with the possible exception of oat bran), and one of the things nutritionism reliably gives us is some such dispensation: low-fat cookies then, low-carb beer now. Itâ€™s hard to imagine the low-fat craze taking off as it did if McGovernâ€™s original food-based recommendations had stood: eat fewer meat and dairy products. For how do you get from that stark counsel to the idea that another case of Snackwellâ€™s is just what the doctor ordered?,BAD SCIENCE,But if nutritionism leads to a kind of false consciousness in the mind of the eater, the ideology can just as easily mislead the scientist. Most nutritional science involves studying one nutrient at a time, an approach that even nutritionists who do it will tell you is deeply flawed. â€œThe problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,â€ù points out Marion Nestle, the New York University nutritionist, â€œis that it takes the nutrient out of the context of food, the food out of the context of diet and the diet out of the context of lifestyle.â€ù,If nutritional scientists know this, why do they do it anyway? Because a nutrient bias is built into the way science is done: scientists need individual variables they can isolate. Yet even the simplest food is a hopelessly complex thing to study, a virtual wilderness of chemical compounds, many of which exist in complex and dynamic relation to one another, and all of which together are in the process of changing from one state to another. So if youâ€™re a nutritional scientist, you do the only thing you can do, given the tools at your disposal: break the thing down into its component parts and study those one by one, even if that means ignoring complex interactions and contexts, as well as the fact that the whole may be more than, or just different from, the sum of its parts. This is what we mean by reductionist science.,Scientific reductionism is an undeniably powerful tool, but it can mislead us too, especially when applied to something as complex as, on the one side, a food, and on the other, a human eater. It encourages us to take a mechanistic view of that transaction: put in this nutrient; get out that physiological result. Yet people differ in important ways. Some populations can metabolize sugars better than others; depending on your evolutionary heritage, you may or may not be able to digest the lactose in milk. The specific ecology of your intestines helps determine how efficiently you digest what you eat, so that the same input of 100 calories may yield more or less energy depending on the proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes living in your gut. There is nothing very machinelike about the human eater, and so to think of food as simply fuel is wrong.,Also, people donâ€™t eat nutrients, they eat foods, and foods can behave very differently than the nutrients they contain. Researchers have long believed, based on epidemiological comparisons of different populations, that a diet high in fruits and vegetables confers some protection against cancer. So naturally they ask, What nutrients in those plant foods are responsible for that effect? One hypothesis is that the antioxidants in fresh produce â€” compounds like beta carotene, lycopene, vitamin E, etc. â€” are the X factor. It makes good sense: these molecules (which plants produce to protect themselves from the highly reactive oxygen atoms produced in photosynthesis) vanquish the free radicals in our bodies, which can damage , and initiate cancers. At least thatâ€™s how it seems to work in the test tube. Yet as soon as you remove these useful molecules from the context of the whole foods theyâ€™re found in, as weâ€™ve done in creating antioxidant supplements, they donâ€™t work at all. Indeed, in the case of beta carotene ingested as a supplement, scientists have discovered that it actually increases the risk of certain cancers. Big oops.,Whatâ€™s going on here? We donâ€™t know. It could be the vagaries of human digestion. Maybe the fiber (or some other component) in a carrot protects the antioxidant molecules from destruction by stomach acids early in the digestive process. Or it could be that we isolated the wrong antioxidant. Beta is just one of a whole slew of carotenes found in common vegetables; maybe we focused on the wrong one. Or maybe beta carotene works as an antioxidant only in concert with some other plant chemical or process; under other circumstances, it may behave as a pro-oxidant.,Indeed, to look at the chemical composition of any common food plant is to realize just how much complexity lurks within it. Hereâ€™s a list of just the antioxidants that have been identified in garden-variety thyme:,4-Terpineol, alanine, anethole, apigenin, ascorbic acid, beta carotene, caffeic acid, camphene, carvacrol, chlorogenic acid, chrysoeriol, eriodictyol, eugenol, ferulic acid, gallic acid, gamma-terpinene isochlorogenic acid, isoeugenol, isothymonin, kaempferol, labiatic acid, lauric acid, linalyl acetate, luteolin, methionine, myrcene, myristic acid, naringenin, oleanolic acid, p-coumoric acid, p-hydroxy-benzoic acid, palmitic acid, rosmarinic acid, selenium, tannin, thymol, tryptophan, ursolic acid, vanillic acid.,This is what youâ€™re ingesting when you eat food flavored with thyme. Some of these chemicals are broken down by your digestion, but others are going on to do undetermined things to your body: turning some geneâ€™s expression on or off, perhaps, or heading off a free radical before it disturbs a strand of DNA deep in some cell. It would be great to know how this all works, but in the meantime we can enjoy thyme in the knowledge that it probably doesnâ€™t do any harm (since people have been eating it forever) and that it may actually do some good (since people have been eating it forever) and that even if it does nothing, we like the way it tastes.,Itâ€™s also important to remind ourselves that what reductive science can manage to perceive well enough to isolate and study is subject to change, and that we have a tendency to assume that what we can see is all there is to see. When William Prout isolated the big three macronutrients, scientists figured they now understood food and what the body needs from it; when the vitamins were isolated a few decades later, scientists thought, O.K., now we really understand food and what the body needs to be healthy; today itâ€™s the polyphenols and carotenoids that seem all-important. But who knows what the hell else is going on deep in the soul of a carrot?,The good news is that, to the carrot eater, it doesnâ€™t matter. Thatâ€™s the great thing about eating food as compared with nutrients: you donâ€™t need to fathom a carrotâ€™s complexity to reap its benefits.,The case of the antioxidants points up the dangers in taking a nutrient out of the context of food; as Nestle suggests, scientists make a second, related error when they study the food out of the context of the diet. We donâ€™t eat just one thing, and when we are eating any one thing, weâ€™re not eating another. We also eat foods in combinations and in orders that can affect how theyâ€™re absorbed. Drink coffee with your steak, and your body wonâ€™t be able to fully absorb the iron in the meat. The trace of limestone in the corn tortilla unlocks essential amino acids in the corn that would otherwise remain unavailable. Some of those compounds in that sprig of thyme may well affect my digestion of the dish I add it to, helping to break down one compound or possibly stimulate production of an enzyme to detoxify another. We have barely begun to understand the relationships among foods in a cuisine.,But we do understand some of the simplest relationships, like the zero-sum relationship: that if you eat a lot of meat youâ€™re probably not eating a lot of vegetables. This simple fact may explain why populations that eat diets high in meat have higher rates of coronary heart disease and cancer than those that donâ€™t. Yet nutritionism encourages us to look elsewhere for the explanation: deep within the meat itself, to the culpable nutrient, which scientists have long assumed to be the saturated fat. So they are baffled when large-population studies, like the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative, fail to find that reducing fat intake significantly reduces the incidence of heart disease or cancer.,Of course thanks to the low-fat fad (inspired by the very same reductionist fat hypothesis), it is entirely possible to reduce your intake of saturated fat without significantly reducing your consumption of animal protein: just drink the low-fat milk and order the skinless chicken breast or the turkey bacon. So maybe the culprit nutrient in meat and dairy is the animal protein itself, as some researchers now hypothesize. (The Cornell nutritionist T. Colin Campbell argues as much in his recent book, â€œThe China Study.â€ù) Or, as the Harvard epidemiologist Walter C. Willett suggests, it could be the , , typically present in the milk and meat; these hormones (which occur naturally in meat and milk but are often augmented in industrial production) are known to promote certain cancers.,But people worried about their health neednâ€™t wait for scientists to settle this question before deciding that it might be wise to eat more plants and less meat. This is of course precisely what the McGovern committee was trying to tell us.,Nestle also cautions against taking the diet out of the context of the lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet is widely believed to be one of the most healthful ways to eat, yet much of what we know about it is based on studies of people living on the island of Crete in the 1950s, who in many respects lived lives very different from our own. Yes, they ate lots of olive oil and little meat. But they also did more physical labor. They fasted regularly. They ate a lot of wild greens â€” weeds. And, perhaps most important, they consumed far fewer total calories than we do. Similarly, much of what we know about the health benefits of a vegetarian diet is based on studies of Seventh Day Adventists, who muddy the nutritional picture by drinking absolutely no alcohol and never ,. These extraneous but unavoidable factors are called, aptly, â€œconfounders.â€ù One last example: People who take supplements are healthier than the population at large, but their health probably has nothing whatsoever to do with the supplements they take â€” which recent studies have suggested are worthless. Supplement-takers are better-educated, more-affluent people who, almost by definition, take a greater-than-normal interest in personal health â€” confounding factors that probably account for their superior health.,But if confounding factors of lifestyle bedevil comparative studies of different populations, the supposedly more rigorous â€œprospectiveâ€ù studies of large American populations suffer from their own arguably even more disabling flaws. In these studies â€” of which the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative is the best known â€” a large population is divided into two groups. The intervention group changes its diet in some prescribed manner, while the control group does not. The two groups are then tracked over many years to learn whether the intervention affects relative rates of chronic disease.,When it comes to studying nutrition, this sort of extensive, long-term clinical trial is supposed to be the gold standard. It certainly sounds sound. In the case of the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the eating habits and health outcomes of nearly 49,000 women (ages 50 to 79 at the beginning of the study) were tracked for eight years. One group of the women were told to reduce their consumption of fat to 20 percent of total calories. The results were announced early last year, producing front-page headlines of which the one in this newspaper was typical: â€œLow-Fat Diet Does Not Cut Health Risks, Study Finds.â€ù And the cloud of nutritional confusion over the country darkened.,But even a cursory analysis of the studyâ€™s methods makes you wonder why anyone would take such a finding seriously, let alone order a Quarter Pounder With Cheese to celebrate it, as many newspaper readers no doubt promptly went out and did. Even the beginner student of nutritionism will immediately spot several flaws: the focus was on â€œfat,â€ù rather than on any particular food, like meat or dairy. So women could comply simply by switching to lower-fat animal products. Also, no distinctions were made between types of fat: women getting their allowable portion of fat from olive oil or fish were lumped together with woman getting their fat from low-fat cheese or chicken breasts or margarine. Why? Because when the study was designed 16 years ago, the whole notion of â€œgood fatsâ€ù was not yet on the scientific scope. Scientists study what scientists can see.,But perhaps the biggest flaw in this study, and other studies like it, is that we have no idea what these women were really eating because, like most people when asked about their diet, they lied about it. How do we know this? Deduction. Consider: When the study began, the average participant weighed in at 170 pounds and claimed to be eating 1,800 calories a day. It would take an unusual metabolism to maintain that weight on so little food. And it would take an even freakier metabolism to drop only one or two pounds after getting down to a diet of 1,400 to 1,500 calories a day â€” as the women on the â€œlow-fatâ€ù regimen claimed to have done. Sorry, ladies, but I just donâ€™t buy it.,In fact, nobody buys it. Even the scientists who conduct this sort of research conduct it in the knowledge that people lie about their food intake all the time. They even have scientific figures for the magnitude of the lie. Dietary trials like the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative rely on â€œfood-frequency questionnaires,â€ù and studies suggest that people on average eat between a fifth and a third more than they claim to on the questionnaires. How do the researchers know that? By comparing what people report on questionnaires with interviews about their dietary intake over the previous 24 hours, thought to be somewhat more reliable. In fact, the magnitude of the lie could be much greater, judging by the huge disparity between the total number of food calories produced every day for each American (3,900 calories) and the average number of those calories Americans own up to chomping: 2,000. (Waste accounts for some of the disparity, but nowhere near all of it.) All we really know about how much people actually eat is that the real number lies somewhere between those two figures.,To try to fill out the food-frequency questionnaire used by the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative, as I recently did, is to realize just how shaky the data on which such trials rely really are.

, which took about 45 minutes to complete, started off with some relatively easy questions: â€œDid you eat chicken or turkey during the last three months?â€ù Having answered yes, I was then asked, â€œWhen you ate chicken or turkey, how often did you eat the skin?â€ù But the survey soon became harder, as when it asked me to think back over the past three months to recall whether when I ate okra, squash or yams, they were fried, and if so, were they fried in stick margarine, tub margarine, butter, â€œshorteningâ€ù (in which category they inexplicably lump together hydrogenated vegetable oil and lard), olive or canola oil or nonstick spray? I honestly didnâ€™t remember, and in the case of any okra eaten in a restaurant, even a hypnotist could not get out of me what sort of fat it was fried in. In the meat section, the portion sizes specified havenâ€™t been seen in America since the Hoover administration. If a four-ounce portion of steak is considered â€œmedium,â€ù was I really going to admit that the steak I enjoyed on an unrecallable number of occasions during the past three months was probably the equivalent of two or three (or, in the case of a steakhouse steak, no less than four) of these portions? I think not. In fact, most of the â€œmedium serving sizesâ€ù to which I was asked to compare my own consumption made me feel piggish enough to want to shave a few ounces here, a few there. (I mean, I wasnâ€™t under oath or anything, was I?),This is the sort of data on which the largest questions of diet and health are being decided in America today.,THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM,In the end, the biggest, most ambitious and widely reported studies of diet and health leave more or less undisturbed the main features of the Western diet: lots of meat and processed foods, lots of added fat and sugar, lots of everything â€” except fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In keeping with the nutritionism paradigm and the limits of reductionist science, the researchers fiddle with single nutrients as best they can, but the populations they recruit and study are typical American eaters doing what typical American eaters do: trying to eat a little less of this nutrient, a little more of that, depending on the latest thinking. (One problem with the control groups in these studies is that they too are exposed to nutritional fads in the culture, so over time their eating habits come to more closely resemble the habits of the intervention group.) It should not surprise us that the findings of such research would be so equivocal and confusing.,But what about the elephant in the room â€” the Western diet? It might be useful, in the midst of our deepening confusion about nutrition, to review what we do know about diet and health. What we know is that people who eat the way we do in America today suffer much higher rates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and obesity than people eating more traditional diets. (Four of the 10 leading killers in America are linked to diet.) Further, we know that simply by moving to America, people from nations with low rates of these â€œdiseases of affluenceâ€ù will quickly acquire them. Nutritionism by and large takes the Western diet as a given, seeking to moderate its most deleterious effects by isolating the bad nutrients in it â€” things like fat, sugar, salt â€” and encouraging the public and the food industry to limit them. But after several decades of nutrient-based health advice, rates of cancer and heart disease in the U.S. have declined only slightly (mortality from heart disease is down since the â€™50s, but this is mainly because of improved treatment), and rates of obesity and diabetes have soared.,No one likes to admit that his or her best efforts at understanding and solving a problem have actually made the problem worse, but thatâ€™s exactly what has happened in the case of nutritionism. Scientists operating with the best of intentions, using the best tools at their disposal, have taught us to look at food in a way that has diminished our pleasure in eating it while doing little or nothing to improve our health. Perhaps what we need now is a broader, less reductive view of what food is, one that is at once more ecological and cultural. What would happen, for example, if we were to start thinking about food as less of a thing and more of a relationship?,In nature, that is of course precisely what eating has always been: relationships among species in what we call food chains, or webs, that reach all the way down to the soil. Species co-evolve with the other species they eat, and very often a relationship of interdependence develops: Iâ€™ll feed you if you spread around my genes. A gradual process of mutual adaptation transforms something like an apple or a squash into a nutritious and tasty food for a hungry animal. Over time and through trial and error, the plant becomes tastier (and often more conspicuous) in order to gratify the animalâ€™s needs and desires, while the animal gradually acquires whatever digestive tools (enzymes, etc.) are needed to make optimal use of the plant. Similarly, cowâ€™s milk did not start out as a nutritious food for humans; in fact, it made them sick until humans who lived around cows evolved the ability to digest lactose as adults. This development proved much to the advantage of both the milk drinkers and the cows.,â€œHealthâ€ù is, among other things, the byproduct of being involved in these sorts of relationships in a food chain â€” involved in a great many of them, in the case of an omnivorous creature like us. Further, when the health of one link of the food chain is disturbed, it can affect all the creatures in it. When the soil is sick or in some way deficient, so will be the grasses that grow in that soil and the cattle that eat the grasses and the people who drink the milk. Or, as the English agronomist Sir Albert Howard put it in 1945 in â€œThe Soil and Healthâ€ù (a founding text of organic agriculture), we would do well to regard â€œthe whole problem of health in soil, plant, animal and man as one great subject.â€ù Our personal health is inextricably bound up with the health of the entire food web.,In many cases, long familiarity between foods and their eaters leads to elaborate systems of communications up and down the food chain, so that a creatureâ€™s senses come to recognize foods as suitable by taste and smell and color, and our bodies learn what to do with these foods after they pass the test of the senses, producing in anticipation the chemicals necessary to break them down. Health depends on knowing how to read these biological signals: this smells spoiled; this looks ripe; thatâ€™s one good-looking cow. This is easier to do when a creature has long experience of a food, and much harder when a food has been designed expressly to deceive its senses â€” with artificial flavors, say, or synthetic sweeteners.,Note that these ecological relationships are between eaters and whole foods, not nutrients. Even though the foods in question eventually get broken down in our bodies into simple nutrients, as corn is reduced to simple sugars, the qualities of the whole food are not unimportant â€” they govern such things as the speed at which the sugars will be released and absorbed, which weâ€™re coming to see as critical to insulin metabolism. Put another way, our bodies have a longstanding and sustainable relationship to corn that we do not have to high-fructose corn syrup. Such a relationship with corn syrup might develop someday (as people evolve superhuman insulin systems to cope with regular floods of fructose and glucose), but for now the relationship leads to ill health because our bodies donâ€™t know how to handle these biological novelties. In much the same way, human bodies that can cope with chewing coca leaves â€” a longstanding relationship between native people and the coca plant in South America â€” cannot cope with cocaine or crack, even though the same â€œactive ingredientsâ€ù are present in all three. Reductionism as a way of understanding food or drugs may be harmless, even necessary, but reductionism in practice can lead to problems.,Looking at eating through this ecological lens opens a whole new perspective on exactly what the Western diet is: a radical and rapid change not just in our foodstuffs over the course of the 20th century but also in our food relationships, all the way from the soil to the meal. The ideology of nutritionism is itself part of that change. To get a firmer grip on the nature of those changes is to begin to know how we might make our relationships to food healthier. These changes have been numerous and far-reaching, but consider as a start these four large-scale ones:,From Whole Foods to Refined. The case of corn points up one of the key features of the modern diet: a shift toward increasingly refined foods, especially carbohydrates. Call it applied reductionism. Humans have been refining grains since at least the Industrial Revolution, favoring white flour (and white rice) even at the price of lost nutrients. Refining grains extends their shelf life (precisely because it renders them less nutritious to pests) and makes them easier to digest, by removing the fiber that ordinarily slows the release of their sugars. Much industrial food production involves an extension and intensification of this practice, as food processors find ways to deliver glucose â€” the brainâ€™s preferred fuel â€” ever more swiftly and efficiently. Sometimes this is precisely the point, as when corn is refined into corn syrup; other times it is an unfortunate byproduct of food processing, as when freezing food destroys the fiber that would slow sugar absorption.,So fast food is fast in this other sense too: it is to a considerable extent predigested, in effect, and therefore more readily absorbed by the body. But while the widespread acceleration of the Western diet offers us the instant gratification of sugar, in many people (and especially those newly exposed to it) the â€œspeedinessâ€ù of this food overwhelms the insulin response and leads to Type II diabetes. As one nutrition expert put it to me, weâ€™re in the middle of â€œa national experiment in mainlining glucose.â€ù To encounter such a diet for the first time, as when people accustomed to a more traditional diet come to America, or when fast food comes to their countries, delivers a shock to the system. Public-health experts call it â€œthe nutrition transition,â€ù and it can be deadly.,From Complexity to Simplicity. If there is one word that covers nearly all the changes industrialization has made to the food chain, it would be simplification. Chemical fertilizers simplify the chemistry of the soil, which in turn appears to simplify the chemistry of the food grown in that soil. Since the widespread adoption of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers in the 1950s, the nutritional quality of produce in America has, according to U.S.D.A. figures, declined significantly. Some researchers blame the quality of the soil for the decline; others cite the tendency of modern plant breeding to select for industrial qualities like yield rather than nutritional quality. Whichever it is, the trend toward simplification of our food continues on up the chain. Processing foods depletes them of many nutrients, a few of which are then added back in through â€œfortificationâ€ù: folic acid in refined flour, vitamins and minerals in breakfast cereal. But food scientists can add back only the nutrients food scientists recognize as important. What are they overlooking?,Simplification has occurred at the level of species diversity, too. The astounding variety of foods on offer in the modern supermarket obscures the fact that the actual number of species in the modern diet is shrinking. For reasons of economics, the food industry prefers to tease its myriad processed offerings from a tiny group of plant species, corn and soybeans chief among them. Today, a mere four crops account for two-thirds of the calories humans eat. When you consider that humankind has historically consumed some 80,000 edible species, and that 3,000 of these have been in widespread use, this represents a radical simplification of the food web. Why should this matter? Because humans are omnivores, requiring somewhere between 50 and 100 different chemical compounds and elements to be healthy. Itâ€™s hard to believe that we can get everything we need from a diet consisting largely of processed corn, soybeans, wheat and rice.,From Leaves to Seeds. Itâ€™s no coincidence that most of the plants we have come to rely on are grains; these crops are exceptionally efficient at transforming sunlight into macronutrients â€” carbs, fats and proteins. These macronutrients in turn can be profitably transformed into animal protein (by feeding them to animals) and processed foods of every description. Also, the fact that grains are durable seeds that can be stored for long periods means they can function as commodities as well as food, making these plants particularly well suited to the needs of industrial capitalism.,The needs of the human eater are another matter. An oversupply of macronutrients, as we now have, itself represents a serious threat to our health, as evidenced by soaring rates of obesity and diabetes. But the undersupply of micronutrients may constitute a threat just as serious. Put in the simplest terms, weâ€™re eating a lot more seeds and a lot fewer leaves, a tectonic dietary shift the full implications of which we are just beginning to glimpse. If I may borrow the nutritionistâ€™s reductionist vocabulary for a moment, there are a host of critical micronutrients that are harder to get from a diet of refined seeds than from a diet of leaves. There are the antioxidants and all the other newly discovered phytochemicals (remember that sprig of thyme?); there is the fiber, and then there are the healthy omega-3 fats found in leafy green plants, which may turn out to be most important benefit of all.,Most people associate omega-3 fatty acids with fish, but fish get them from green plants (specifically algae), which is where they all originate. Plant leaves produce these essential fatty acids (â€œessentialâ€ù because our bodies canâ€™t produce them on their own) as part of photosynthesis. Seeds contain more of another essential fatty acid: omega-6. Without delving too deeply into the biochemistry, the two fats perform very different functions, in the plant as well as the plant eater. Omega-3s appear to play an important role in neurological development and processing, the permeability of cell walls, the metabolism of glucose and the calming of inflammation. Omega-6s are involved in fat storage (which is what they do for the plant), the rigidity of cell walls, clotting and the inflammation response. (Think of omega-3s as fleet and flexible, omega-6s as sturdy and slow.) Since the two lipids compete with each other for the attention of important enzymes, the ratio between omega-3s and omega-6s may matter more than the absolute quantity of either fat. Thus too much omega-6 may be just as much a problem as too little omega-3.,And that might well be a problem for people eating a Western diet. As weâ€™ve shifted from leaves to seeds, the ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s in our bodies has shifted, too. At the same time, modern food-production practices have further diminished the omega-3s in our diet. Omega-3s, being less stable than omega-6s, spoil more readily, so we have selected for plants that produce fewer of them; further, when we partly hydrogenate oils to render them more stable, omega-3s are eliminated. Industrial meat, raised on seeds rather than leaves, has fewer omega-3s and more omega-6s than preindustrial meat used to have. And official dietary advice since the 1970s has promoted the consumption of polyunsaturated vegetable oils, most of which are high in omega-6s (corn and soy, especially). Thus, without realizing what we were doing, we significantly altered the ratio of these two essential fats in our diets and bodies, with the result that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the typical American today stands at more than 10 to 1; before the widespread introduction of seed oils at the turn of the last century, it was closer to 1 to 1.,The role of these lipids is not completely understood, but many researchers say that these historically low levels of omega-3 (or, conversely, high levels of omega-6) bear responsibility for many of the chronic diseases associated with the Western diet, especially heart disease and diabetes. (Some researchers implicate omega-3 deficiency in rising rates of depression and learning disabilities as well.) To remedy this deficiency, nutritionism classically argues for taking omega-3 supplements or fortifying food products, but because of the complex, competitive relationship between omega-3 and omega-6, adding more omega-3s to the diet may not do much good unless you also reduce your intake of omega-6.,From Food Culture to Food Science. The last important change wrought by the Western diet is not, strictly speaking, ecological. But the industrialization of our food that we call the Western diet is systematically destroying traditional food cultures. Before the modern food era â€” and before nutritionism â€” people relied for guidance about what to eat on their national or ethnic or regional cultures. We think of culture as a set of beliefs and practices to help mediate our relationship to other people, but of course culture (at least before the rise of science) has also played a critical role in helping mediate peopleâ€™s relationship to nature. Eating being a big part of that relationship, cultures have had a great deal to say about what and how and why and when and how much we should eat. Of course when it comes to food, culture is really just a fancy word for Mom, the figure who typically passes on the food ways of the group â€” food ways that, although they were never â€œdesignedâ€ù to optimize health (we have many reasons to eat the way we do), would not have endured if they did not keep eaters alive and well.,The sheer novelty and glamour of the Western diet, with its 17,000 new food products introduced every year, and the marketing muscle used to sell these products, has overwhelmed the force of tradition and left us where we now find ourselves: relying on science and journalism and marketing to help us decide questions about what to eat. Nutritionism, which arose to help us better deal with the problems of the Western diet, has largely been co-opted by it, used by the industry to sell more food and to undermine the authority of traditional ways of eating. You would not have read this far into this article if your food culture were intact and healthy; you would simply eat the way your parents and grandparents and great-grandparents taught you to eat. The question is, Are we better off with these new authorities than we were with the traditional authorities they supplanted? The answer by now should be clear.,It might be argued that, at this point in history, we should simply accept that fast food is our food culture. Over time, people will get used to eating this way and our health will improve. But for natural selection to help populations adapt to the Western diet, weâ€™d have to be prepared to let those whom it sickens die. Thatâ€™s not what weâ€™re doing. Rather, weâ€™re turning to the health-care industry to help us â€œadapt.â€ù Medicine is learning how to keep alive the people whom the Western diet is making sick. Itâ€™s gotten good at extending the lives of people with heart disease, and now itâ€™s working on obesity and diabetes. Capitalism is itself marvelously adaptive, able to turn the problems it creates into lucrative business opportunities: diet pills, heart-bypass operations, insulin pumps, bariatric surgery. But while fast food may be good business for the health-care industry, surely the cost to society â€” estimated at more than $200 billion a year in diet-related health-care costs â€” is unsustainable.,BEYOND NUTRITIONISM,To medicalize the diet problem is of course perfectly consistent with nutritionism. So what might a more ecological or cultural approach to the problem recommend? How might we plot our escape from nutritionism and, in turn, from the deleterious effects of the modern diet? In theory nothing could be simpler â€” stop thinking and eating that way â€” but this is somewhat harder to do in practice, given the food environment we now inhabit and the loss of sharp cultural tools to guide us through it. Still, I do think escape is possible, to which end I can now revisit â€” and elaborate on, but just a little â€” the simple principles of healthy eating I proposed at the beginning of this essay, several thousand words ago. So try these few (flagrantly unscientific) rules of thumb, collected in the course of my nutritional odyssey, and see if they donâ€™t at least point us in the right direction.,1. Eat food. Though in our current state of confusion, this is much easier said than done. So try this: Donâ€™t eat anything your great-great-grandmother wouldnâ€™t recognize as food. (Sorry, but at this point Moms are as confused as the rest of us, which is why we have to go back a couple of generations, to a time before the advent of modern food products.) There are a great many foodlike items in the supermarket your ancestors wouldnâ€™t recognize as food (Go-Gurt? Breakfast-cereal bars? Nondairy creamer?); stay away from these.,2. Avoid even those food products that come bearing health claims. Theyâ€™re apt to be heavily processed, and the claims are often dubious at best. Donâ€™t forget that margarine, one of the first industrial foods to claim that it was more healthful than the traditional food it replaced, turned out to give people heart attacks. When Kelloggâ€™s can boast about its Healthy Heart Strawberry Vanilla cereal bars, health claims have become hopelessly compromised. (The American Heart Association charges food makers for their endorsement.) Donâ€™t take the silence of the yams as a sign that they have nothing valuable to say about health.,3. Especially avoid food products containing ingredients that are a) unfamiliar, b) unpronounceable c) more than five in number â€” or that contain high-fructose corn syrup.None of these characteristics are necessarily harmful in and of themselves, but all of them are reliable markers for foods that have been highly processed.,4. Get out of the supermarket whenever possible. You wonâ€™t find any high-fructose corn syrup at the farmerâ€™s market; you also wonâ€™t find food harvested long ago and far away. What you will find are fresh whole foods picked at the peak of nutritional quality. Precisely the kind of food your great-great-grandmother would have recognized as food.,5. Pay more, eat less. The American food system has for a century devoted its energies and policies to increasing quantity and reducing price, not to improving quality. Thereâ€™s no escaping the fact that better food â€” measured by taste or nutritional quality (which often correspond) â€” costs more, because it has been grown or raised less intensively and with more care. Not everyone can afford to eat well in America, which is shameful, but most of us can: Americans spend, on average, less than 10 percent of their income on food, down from 24 percent in 1947, and less than the citizens of any other nation. And those of us who can afford to eat well should. Paying more for food well grown in good soils â€” whether certified organic or not â€” will contribute not only to your health (by reducing exposure to pesticides) but also to the health of others who might not themselves be able to afford that sort of food: the people who grow it and the people who live downstream, and downwind, of the farms where it is grown.,â€œEat lessâ€ù is the most unwelcome advice of all, but in fact the scientific case for eating a lot less than we currently do is compelling. â€œCalorie restrictionâ€ù has repeatedly been shown to slow aging in animals, and many researchers (including Walter Willett, the Harvard epidemiologist) believe it offers the single strongest link between diet and cancer prevention. Food abundance is a problem, but culture has helped here, too, by promoting the idea of moderation. Once one of the longest-lived people on earth, the Okinawans practiced a principle they called â€œHara Hachi Buâ€ù: eat until you are 80 percent full. To make the â€œeat lessâ€ù message a bit more palatable, consider that quality may have a bearing on quantity: I donâ€™t know about you, but the better the quality of the food I eat, the less of it I need to feel satisfied. All tomatoes are not created equal.,6. Eat mostly plants, especially leaves. Scientists may disagree on whatâ€™s so good about plants â€” the antioxidants? Fiber? Omega-3s? â€” but they do agree that theyâ€™re probably really good for you and certainly canâ€™t hurt. Also, by eating a plant-based diet, youâ€™ll be consuming far fewer calories, since plant foods (except seeds) are typically less â€œenergy denseâ€ù than the other things you might eat. Vegetarians are healthier than carnivores, but near vegetarians (â€œflexitariansâ€ù) are as healthy as vegetarians. Thomas Jefferson was on to something when he advised treating meat more as a flavoring than a food.,7. Eat more like the French. Or the Japanese. Or the Italians. Or the Greeks. Confounding factors aside, people who eat according to the rules of a traditional food culture are generally healthier than we are. Any traditional diet will do: if it werenâ€™t a healthy diet, the people who follow it wouldnâ€™t still be around. True, food cultures are embedded in societies and economies and ecologies, and some of them travel better than others: Inuit not so well as Italian. In borrowing from a food culture, pay attention to how a culture eats, as well as to what it eats. In the case of the French paradox, it may not be the dietary nutrients that keep the French healthy (lots of saturated fat and alcohol?!) so much as the dietary habits: small portions, no seconds or snacking, communal meals â€” and the serious pleasure taken in eating. (Worrying about diet canâ€™t possibly be good for you.) Let culture be your guide, not science.,8. Cook. And if you can, plant a garden. To take part in the intricate and endlessly interesting processes of providing for our sustenance is the surest way to escape the culture of fast food and the values implicit in it: that food should be cheap and easy; that food is fuel and not communion. The culture of the kitchen, as embodied in those enduring traditions we call cuisines, contains more wisdom about diet and health than you are apt to find in any nutrition journal or journalism. Plus, the food you grow yourself contributes to your health long before you sit down to eat it. So you might want to think about putting down this article now and picking up a spatula or hoe.,9. Eat like an omnivore. Try to add new species, not just new foods, to your diet. The greater the diversity of species you eat, the more likely you are to cover all your nutritional bases. That of course is an argument from nutritionism, but there is a better one, one that takes a broader view of â€œhealth.â€ù Biodiversity in the diet means less monoculture in the fields. What does that have to do with your health? Everything. The vast monocultures that now feed us require tremendous amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to keep from collapsing. Diversifying those fields will mean fewer chemicals, healthier soils, healthier plants and animals and, in turn, healthier people. Itâ€™s all connected, which is another way of saying that your health isnâ€™t bordered by your body and that whatâ€™s good for the soil is probably good for you," too.""",MICHAEL POLLAN,"JAN. 28, 2007",Unhappy Meals,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html
"One of the sturdy clichÃ©s of contemporary brand-building is the importance of avoiding an image thatâ€™s too â€œcrunchyâ€ù or, worse, too â€œgranola-y.â€ù Thatâ€™s particularly true â€” and maybe particularly challenging â€” for businesses that want to transcend green or health-conscious consumer niches. But itâ€™s really challenging if what youâ€™re selling is, in point of fact, granola.,The founders of Bear Naked were conscious of this when they started selling their product in 2002. It was â€œan enormous issue,â€ù Brendan Synnott says, and for the first two and half years of the brandâ€™s existence, he and Kelly Flatley didnâ€™t even put the word on their packaging. â€œI used to hate being called granola,â€ù he says. â€œYou hear â€˜granola,â€™ and you think hairy legs and Birkenstocks. That was the reputation.â€ù Flatley had less of a problem with the word â€œgranola,â€ù partly because she likes granola and partly because thatâ€™s what Bear Naked is. In fact, itâ€™s the top-selling granola brand in natural-foods stores, as ranked by SPINS, a data collector, and the No. 2 branded manufacturer in conventional stores, including places like Target and Costco, according to Bear Naked, which gets its data from ACNielsen.,Flatley, a healthful-living, outdoorsy type, liked to make her own granola while in college and later began to sell it at some local markets in Darien, Conn., her hometown. Around this time, she happened to reconnect with Synnott, a high-school friend who had done stints at an Austin software firm and on the staff of â€œSaturday Night Live.â€ù They decided to go into business together.,They did stick with the name Bear Naked, which had â€œpersonality,â€ù as Flatley puts it: â€œa playful, youthful, vibrant, athletic company.â€ù Personality was important, since, strictly speaking, there isnâ€™t a whole lot to granola. Itâ€™s a mix of oats, nuts, honey and perhaps other stuff like dried fruit, all of it baked. Even Synnott describes Bear Naked as â€œingredients that you could basically get out of your cabinet.â€ù Getting people to pay $5 for a 12-ounce bag of it seems like enough of a challenge without the hairy-leg problem.,Part of their strategy to bring some â€œinnovationâ€ù to the category involved packaging: apart from eliminating the word â€œgranola,â€ù they also banished actual bear imagery and any graphics that resembled oats or connoted nature (too crunchy) in favor of a more minimalist design featuring three slashes suggesting claw marks. Instead of a box (granola is positioned as cereal in most stores), they opted for a stand-up pouch with a transparent panel, so people could see the ingredients and squeeze the package. And instead of health and nutrition boasts, the pouch text played up the youthful, â€œactive lifestyleâ€ù-loving founders. (Thatâ€™s even more true on the companyâ€™s Web site, which includes pictures of them in high school and in the great outdoors, along with repeated reminders that they are in their 20s.),Beyond that, their main marketing tactic has been in-store sampling. After a breakthrough placement in Stew Leonardâ€™s, a grocery chain based in Norwalk, Conn., in 2003, the brand found its way into Whole Foods and then into more mass-market retail stores across the country, and expanded into hot cereals. More recently, Bear Naked has tried new tactics, like a promotion with Stonyfield Farm yogurt, and is pondering radio ads, distribution in convenience stores and new product categories that can, Synnott says, â€œleverage that granola equity that weâ€™ve built.â€ù,Granola equity! This bit of business-speak sounds like an oxymoron, but of course Bear Naked has been helped along the way by steadily growing consumer interest in more healthful foods. Bridget Goldschmidt, managing editor of Progressive Grocer, a trade publication, notes that the granola category has grown steadily over the past two years. Kashi (owned by Kellogg) and other brands with more overtly health-oriented images have also raised their profiles. But as Goldshmidt points out, plenty of consumers seem particularly interested in things that are â€œnot just healthy, but that they think are going to be good-tasting and fun, youthful. Not like old hippies.â€ù,Flatley figures that Bear Nakedâ€™s more approachable image is exactly what positions it to benefit from the broader eat-better trend: a not-so-granola-y granola serves as an easy bridge to a more healthful lifestyle, or at least the impression of such a lifestyle. She also figures lots of people are still looking for that bridge, and not just in places like Whole Foods but also in the not-so-rarefied contexts of big-box stores or even the gas-station snack aisle. Thatâ€™s why she and Synnott insist that a granola brand can have, of all things, â€œmass appeal.â€ù",ROB WALKER,"JAN. 28, 2007",Decrunched,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28wwln_consumed.t.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He runs a free tasting every Saturday from 5 to 8 p.m. The rest of the night, he appears to be connected to an alarm that sounds when a patron opens  to the single-malt section of the  menu.,You can't smoke inside the Brandy Library, though it will sell you a cigar. But those for whom Scotch and cigars go together like beer and pretzels need not fear New York City's smoking ban: several places were grandfathered in and specialize in just such a lung-and-liver-damage combination.,At , on the Upper East Side, you can puff on a long list of cigars and choose from about 50 single malts. Smoking a cigar with your Scotch does come with a risk: the ash of your cigar falling into your Scotch glass might add a few new (and unwanted) smoky notes to your 12-year Laphroaig.,Macanudo has just relaxed its no-jeans dress code (still no sneakers), but other places can be more annoying. Lexington Bar & Books, also on the Upper East Side, sticks to its blue-blood neighborhood pedigree by sticking hard to the dress code posted at the entrance. (Dress shirts tucked in, no sneakers, jacket preferred.) What's it like inside? Um, couldn't tell you.,At least at its sister location, you don't have to dress up. , is worthy of the West Village, and its 50 or so single-malt options worthy of a visit. But there is a two-drink minimum on weekends that might not work for those participating in a Scotch hop.,Those interested in the full Scottish experience should head to , in Midtown, where the bartenders wear kilts. Saturdays from 9 p.m. to midnight the pub has live Celtic music in the bar area. The menu has some Scottish flair, with items like haggis â€” ground sheep organs served at St. Andrews with mashed potatoes and turnips. (Don't worry, there are plenty of non-Scottish items, too.) The waiters and waitresses are trained in Scotch awareness, and your server would be happy to put together a three-Scotch flight for the reasonable price of $15.,One place where the old-school dÃ©cor oozes Scotch (alas, not literally) is the bar at , near Herald Square, the perfect place for your post-, single malt. A crowd diverse in age and dress helps diffuse any stuffiness, as do the trivia questions posed on the chalkboard. Even if you insist on Japanese whiskey over all others, Keens can still accommodate you.,KEENS even posts a list of whiskey's positive properties. It was written in the 16th century, so the medical science behind it might be bit outdated. Among the curative properties? It helps digestion, eliminates lisping, prevents the heart from swelling and, most important, keeps the mouth from snafflying. (Snafflying? The Scotch Whisky Association in Edinburgh says the document is probably suggesting that whiskey is good for clearing the throat.),Still, if you ask John Hansell, publisher and editor of  Malt Advocate, a quarterly magazine for whiskey enthusiasts that's based in Pennsylvania, what his favorite Scotch spot in New York City is, you won't get one of these places with leather seating, an air of sophistication or an upscale clientele.,He goes for ,, an East Village bar that is just a step above being a dive and is probably better known for its mind-boggling, if not mind-altering,  beer selection. But its Scotch collection is no slouch, and Mr. Hansell recommends testing d.b.a.'s stock of well-regarded whiskeys from defunct distilleries like Port Ellen while you still have a chance. The only disadvantage is that on weekends it might become too hectic to get sound Scotch advice.,Those who catch the Scotch bug have nine months to tune their palates before the 10th annual WhiskyFest New York, at the Marriott Marquis on Oct. 30. There will be about 200 kinds of whiskey available to test your expertise, including plenty of single-malt and blended Scotch. If it turns out that you still can't tell Cutty Sark from Glenlivet, no problem: Halloween is the next day, and you can at least masquerade as a Scotch connoisseur., 25 North Moore Street (Hudson and Varick Streets), (212) 226-5545., 26 East 63rd Street (Madison and Park Avenues), (212) 752-8200., 41 First Avenue (Second and Third Streets), (212) 475-5097., 636 Hudson Street (Horatio and Jane Streets), (212) 229-2642., 72 West 36th Street (Fifth and Sixth Avenues; sign reads â€œKeen's Chophouseâ€ù), (212) 947-3636., 1020 Lexington Avenue (73rd Street), (212) 717-3902., 120 West 44th Street (Broadway and Sixth Avenue), (212) 840-8413.",SETH KUGEL,"JAN. 28, 2007",Lift a Wee Dram All Over Town,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/travel/28weekend.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IT happens all the time. In 2005 Till Fellner, an Austrian pianist then rising quickly, canceled an appearance in the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center because of illness. A cold? The flu? A sprained finger?,This time the matter was not so simple. Mr. Fellner had  developed tinnitus, an ear affliction that rendered him extremely uncomfortable.,â€œI couldnâ€™t play because everything â€” traffic, people talking â€” seemed much too loud to me,â€ù Mr. Fellner said recently from his home in Vienna. â€œI couldnâ€™t bear listening to anything, so even teaching wasnâ€™t possible.â€ù,Tinnitus can be caused by exposure to sounds that damage the delicate hair cells in  the inner ear, said Dr. Neil Cherian, a neurologist and the director of the Center for Performance Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. One result can be a persistent ringing, hissing or buzzing.,What causes the condition is not always obvious, nor is it necessarily clear what allows normal ear function to return. â€œThere is no consistent  method to help this,â€ù Dr. Cherian said, noting that many tinnitus sufferers recover simply by avoiding reinjury and allowing their ears time to heal.,Ear ailments are well known in classical music. The most famous sufferer was Beethoven, whose decline into deafness has been recounted not only in books and monographs but also in plays and movies â€” recently, â€œCopying Beethoven,â€ù with Ed Harris.,Schumann too endured an ear affliction at least for a time. In the book â€œSchumann: The Inner Voices of a Musical Genius,â€ù Peter Ostwald quotes Schumannâ€™s wife, Clara, describing her husbandâ€™s troubles as a â€œconstant singing and rushing in his ears.â€ù,As for Mr. Fellner, the ailment disappeared with treatment after an agonizing three months, and he resumed his career without making the matter public.,â€œNormally I donâ€™t talk about it,â€ù he said. â€œIn Europe nobody knows about it.â€ù,Now after an absence of more than two years from New York, Mr. Fellner is set to return, playing a program of Bach, Beethoven and Schubert at the Metropolitan Museum on Feb. 8.,â€œI enjoy playing even more than before,â€ù Mr. Fellner said. â€œThere was a lot of thinking going on, but I realized how important it is to me, playing the piano. So Iâ€™m very happy I could continue.â€ù,Mr. Fellner, 34 and a native of Vienna, first performed in the United States in 1995, then appeared regularly in New York and with major orchestras like the Chicago Symphony and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Still he has yet to achieve the fame of other pianists of his generation like Leif Ove Andsnes and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Grimaud.,Part of the reason may be his self-effacing manner. He has been compared to  Tobey Maguire, the star of the Spider-Man films, though he does not so much resemble Mr. Maguire as embody his typical on-screen persona: the awkward boy next door, lanky, a bit goofy and unfailingly earnest. Still there is nothing tentative about Mr. Fellnerâ€™s playing. It is assured, fluid and musical.,â€œTo my mind he has all the ingredients to be on the top,â€ù Alfred Brendel, the elder statesman among Austrian pianists and Mr. Fellnerâ€™s best-known teacher, said from his home in London. â€œIt has impressed me how ambitiously he has developed his repertory from Bach to the present, being equally at home in solo and concerto repertoire, chamber music and lieder.â€ù,The conductor Kent Nagano, who has worked with Mr. Fellner steadily since 1997, is also an admirer. â€œWhen you perform with him, you share the feeling of music as a language beyond technical expression,â€ù Mr. Nagano wrote in an e-mail message. â€œFor me, his music-making has a special kind of truth and natural character.â€ù,Mr. Fellnerâ€™s big break, if the term applies, came three years ago, with the release of his recording of Book 1 of Bachâ€™s â€œWell-Tempered Clavierâ€ù by ECM. The praise from critics was almost universal. Anthony Tommasini, in The New York Times, called the album â€œa major achievementâ€ù and later listed it among the best classical CDs of 2004: â€œone of the most substantive and rewarding recordings of the year.â€ù (Mr. Fellner has yet to follow up that success, though he is scheduled to record Bachâ€™s Two- and Three-Part Inventions for ECM in July.),In addition to Bach, Mr. Fellner performs many Classical and Romantic standards, Mozartâ€™s concertos prominently among them, and continues to expand his range. He recently performed Chopinâ€™s F minor Concerto for the first time, and Beethoven will soon fill his days. He plans to present complete cycles of the Beethoven sonatas in Vienna and London over two seasons, beginning next year.,He also plays less familiar music, including Schoenbergâ€™s solo pieces and the demanding sonata of Julius Reubke, a talented pupil of Liszt who died young. He is especially fond of the music of Gyorgy Kurtag, the contemporary Hungarian composer. â€œExcept for Anton Webern, he is the only composer who can express himself in so few notes,â€ù Mr. Fellner said.,Mr. Fellner has played other contemporary music as well. In 2002 he and the cellist Heinrich Schiff gave the first performance of â€œMumienâ€ù by the Austrian composer Thomas Larcher. And last summer Mr. Fellner and Adrian Brendel, a cellist and Alfred Brendelâ€™s son, performed â€œLied,â€ù a short work by the British composer Harrison Birtwistle written in honor of the elder Mr. Brendelâ€™s 75th birthday. Mr. Fellner is scheduled for premieres by both composers this year.,â€œHis choice of repertory will seem highbrow to some people,â€ù Mr. Brendel said, â€œbut I applaud him for it. And donâ€™t mistake him for a predominantly intellectual player. I heard him do the best live performance of Lisztâ€™s â€˜AnnÃ©es de PÃ¨lerinage.â€™ â€ù,Mr. Brendel and Mr. Fellner met in 1990, when Mr. Fellner, then 20, was studying at the Vienna Conservatory.,â€œI listened to Till, and he sounded promising,â€ù Mr. Brendel said. â€œIt was evident that he was very intelligent.â€ù They have since met two or three times a year, discussing repertory and playing on two pianos.,â€œHeâ€™s a wonderful teacher,â€ù Mr. Fellner said. â€œNormally he demonstrates a lot. On one hand, heâ€™s looking for all the details. But on the other, he gives you a view over the whole piece. What he says is always very precise, very concrete.â€ù,For his part Mr. Brendel said: â€œIt is really a matter of a very valuable friendship. I like to share my experience with young concert pianists who are able to help themselves, and to check them out once in a while, to see whether they remain on course.â€ù,Mr. Fellner, having overcome  a  physical setback, seems to have done just that.",DAVID MERMELSTEIN,"JAN. 28, 2007",Hearing Things.

"POOR ,. Stuck in the middle of Spain, the city has long been perceived as the provincial, sleepy sister to Barcelona. Even today, you can see little girls dressed exactly as their mothers were, in 1940s-style dresses and matching topcoats. But that is precisely Madrid's charm. As the city fast-forwards into the 21st century â€” with designer hotels that rival any international city's, a sleek new airport terminal designed by Antonio Lamela and Richard Rogers and non-tapas bars that flirt with minimalist dÃ©cor â€” Madrid is still the country's political and cultural capital. It remains, as Ernest Hemingway wrote, â€œthe most Spanish of all cities.â€ù,Grab a caÃ±a, or small beer, at the Plaza de Chueca, one of the city's best squares for people watching. It's quite a show: tiny old ladies in knee-length wool coats, young MadrileÃ±os in skin-tight jeans and mullets, and cross-dressing men who look like Amazonian extras in a Pedro AlmodÃ_var film â€” all rushing between the 19th-century town houses, skipping nimbly between piles of dog waste and clutching tiny packages. Sierra (Calle GrÃ¡vina, 11; 34-91-531-0126) is a friendly bar to take in the scene.,There is more to Madrid's booming art scene than the ,. For temporary exhibitions of big-name artists like Roy Lichtenstein without the crowds, check out the smaller museums like the , (Calle CastellÃ_, 77; 34-91-435-4240; ,), the FundaciÃ_n Caja Madrid (Plaza San MartÃ_n, 1; 34-91-379-2349; ,) and the larger but often overlooked , (Paseo del Prado, 8; 34-91-369-0151; ,).,Tapas are a Madrid institution and are served in nearly every bar for just a few euros apiece, so you can spread your dinner across the city. The most traditional and popular tapas restaurants line Calle Cava Baja, a curving street just south of ,. Start at Casa Lucas (Calle Cava Baja, 30; 34-91-365-0804), a homey spot for a slice of tortilla espaÃ±ola (potato omelet), then move up the street for seafood pintxos, the intricate Basque version of tapas, at Txakoli (Calle Cava Baja, 26; 34-91-366-4877). Be warned: these places get more crowded as the night wears on. If balancing plates and shouting doesn't sound like fun, head to ,, a quieter  spot in Salamanca (Calle General DÃ_az Porlier, 91; 34-91-401-4345) for pintxos supplemented by a full Basque menu. For a global twist on tapas, there is a newcomer called , near Plaza Santa Ana (Calle del Prado, 15; 34-91-429-3659) that swaps the Spanish roster for a Scandinavian smorgasbord. Five sandwiches and five shots of vodka to share, for example, are 22 euros, or $28 at $1.29 to the euro. The stark white Belvedere Vodka Lounge downstairs has a D.J. and stays open until 2:30 a.m.,MadrileÃ±os believe that night is the most important time of day. To party like a local, head to the multistory tavern ,, or the Traveler (Plaza Cebada, 11; 34-91-366-9064), which draws everyone from women in their 20s in â€œFlashdanceâ€ù off-the-shoulder sweatshirts to men in business suits. The roof deck offers unobstructed views of the magnificently illuminated BasÃ_lica de San Francisco el Grande.,It's still early in Madrid, so jump over to La Via Lactea, or the Milky Way (Calle Velarde, 18; 34-91-446-7581), an old-school rock 'n' roll bar that is decorated with three decades of concert posters. The bar opened in 1979 at the height of the Movida, the orgiastic explosion of sex and drugs that followed Franco's death. The clientele may have changed since those days, but the vibe is the same.,Have a cortado â€” a shot of espresso topped with milk â€” at trendy , (Calle San Marcos, 37; 34-91-522-0009; ,), an airy loftlike coffee shop with Wi-Fi, fresh muffins and croissants in the heart of the gay-friendly Chueca neighborhood. Once you're awake, take a shopping break among the area's small boutiques. Check out Caligae (Calle Augusto Figueroa, 18; 34-91-532-0240) for boots and shoes from Spanish designers like Chie Mihara, or Ã“ptica Toscana (Calle Hortaleza, 70; 34-91-360-5007; ,), a perfectly preserved 19th-century shop, for quirky eyeglasses.,Downtown Madrid is dotted with historic buildings that allow visitors a peek into the past. The Centro Conde Duque was built in the 18th century as military barracks; today it is a cultural center (Calle Conde Duque, 11, 34-91-588-5834; ,) with a small but excellent collection of modern art. Classical concerts are held Saturday evenings in the large internal courtyard; in the summer, string quartets are replaced by jazz, folk and world music singers like Erykah Badu and Cesaria Evora.,The ,, or Monastery of Barefoot Royals (Plaza de las Descalzas, 34-91-454-8800; ,), is an imposing convent of Franciscan nuns built in the 16th century. The nuns maintain a remarkable collection of 15th-  to 19th-century religious art, including works from Titian and Rubens, some depicting rather gruesome crucifixion scenes. Admission, including a tour, is 5 euros.,5:30 p.m.,Skip the Madison Avenue luxury brands on Calle Serrano, and head one block east where shops like Bazaar (Calle Claudio Coello, 88; 34-91-426-0585) and Scooter (CallejÃ_n de Jorge Juan, 12; 34-91-576-4749) carry of-the-moment French designers like Vanessa Bruno and Tara Jarmon. Nearby, Carmen Kaiser (Calle Claudio Coello, 69 bis; 34-91-576-7496) peddles fancy candles by European labels like Diptyque (41 euros). For post-punk streetwear, head to , (Calle Fuencarral, 45; 34-91-521-4152; ,), a three-story market filled with tiny boutiques like Sentido (34-91-521-5373), which sells funky printed T-shirts (18 euros).,10:30 p.m.,Rub elbows with the Gucci-clad crÃ¨me of Madrid society at , (Calle Jorge Juan, 20; 34-91-436-1100; ,), a restaurant run by the acclaimed chef Alberto Chicote. The clean and bold design is straight out of Elle Decor: a wall of glass opens onto a reflecting pool illuminated by three big light boxes. Indulge in an appetizer of paper-thin eggplant kissed by olive oil and nestled in delicate hummus (10.50 euros), and then tuck into the poached snapper with crisp baby veggies (20 euros). Reservations are mandatory. For a more traditional but no less happening spot, try , (Calle Cava Baja, 35; 34-91-365-8217; ,), a royal family favorite for 30 years. House specialties include huevos estrellados (broken eggs), served over fries (9.60 euros) and solomillo, a sizzling steak served in a scorching hot pan (21 euros). Paulina Rubio, the Mexican pop star, had waiters swooning on a recent visit.,For a bit of green relief, get lost in Retiro, a 330-acre park in the city's center. Rent a bike (By Bike, Avenida MenÃ©ndez Pelayo, 35; 34-902-876-483, ,; 4 euros an hour) or just take a Sunday stroll alongside baby carriages and street performers by the artificial lake.,The big-name museums are free on Sundays, so it's your chance to dip into the Prado (Paseo del Prado; 34-91-330-2800; ,) to see masterpieces like VelÃ¡zquez's â€œMeninasâ€ù or Reina Sofia (Calle Santa Isabel, 52; 34-91-774-1000; ,) for a look at Picasso's â€œGuernica.â€ù,Chances are, you lingered a bit at the Prado. Rest your tired feet at , (Calle Atocha, 14; 34-902-333-334; ,), an authentic Turkish hammam in the heart of Madrid. The hushed terra-cotta subterranean rooms have hot, cold and tepid pools, along with a sultry steam sauna. Take a 90-minute dip (23 euros) and throw in an aromatherapy massage (from 35.50 euros). It's a side of Madrid that Hemingway wouldn't recognize, except that everyone lights up a cigarette as they leave. This is still Spain, after all.,Continental Airlines flies to , from Newark Airport; Iberia and American fly from Kennedy Airport. A Web search found round-trip fares starting around $500 in February. A taxi from Barajas airport to the city center takes  30 to 45 minutes, and costs about 20 euros, or $25.50 at $1.29 to the euro. The city's Metro (Line 8) takes about 30 minutes and costs 1 euro (,).,A number of boutique hotels have opened in downtown Madrid in recent years. ,(Calle Gran Via, 11; 34-91-523-7980; ,) is a stylish hotel in a 19th-century town house between Chueca and Puerta del Sol. Rooms start at 140 euros., (Calle Alfonso XII, 14; 34-91-523-7460; ,) offers sleek design that appeals to tourists and business travelers alike. Housed in a well-preserved 20th-century mansion, many of the 50 rooms offer views of Retiro Park. Rooms start at 268 euros.,(TravesÃ_a de Trujillos, 3; 34-91-701-1670; ,) offers futuristic design at a comfortable price, around the corner from the Monasterio de Descalzas Reales convent.

"THOUGH the regions of Mexico retain their very distinct cuisines, , acts like a food processor, purÃ©eing ingredients until you can't tell what went into the final mix. There are places like ,, a classic old-style, semiformal restaurant, and the wonderfully authentic El Bajio, now with four outposts, considered by many to have the best food in Mexico City; both pick and choose favorite dishes from around the country. Then there is Izote, which features Patricia Quintana's fabulous, decidedly modern and slightly internationalized cuisine. There are scores of brightly colored restaurants serving food so oriented to tourists' palates that they might as well be north of the border. And then there are literally hundreds of places with cheap, good and rarely distinguished food.,But on this trip I was looking for restaurants that shouted of their homelands, and the ones I've selected here have character, promise, good and sometimes incredible food, and distinction. They will not be mistaken for one another, nor for anything else. (They all also have full bars, real service and comfort; you can spend a couple of hours in each, happily.),This is the culinary traveler's dream, a real find, one no visitor to Mexico City should miss. In a working-class neighborhood not far from the historic center, Casa Merlos manages to be lovely, unpretentious and unusual. The space is altogether pleasant, with a high ceiling, stone arches, a marble floor, stucco walls and large windows overlooking a little mezzanine. Almost everyone is a local, and almost everyone knows one another.,It's a family operation; as a stranger, I was introduced to three members, and a fourth â€” the father â€” lingered in the background. The mother and one of the daughters sat at various tables chatting; my evident interest in food, and the fact that one of my companions was a local chef, brought them to ours too.,The food is from Puebla (which makes it poblano), and includes some odd items like chapulines, which I ordered largely because I had never heard of them. As it turns out, I was told they're fried insects,  which didn't keep me from eating them. Their sweet, smoky, bitter and intriguing flavor, combined with their pure crunch, didn't even give me pause; I was enjoying them too much.   Another local specialty you don't see too often is the excellent chalupas, open small tortillas with very fatty pork, best eaten at the beginning of the meal when your appetite is still revved. (They reminded me of the lardo di Colonnata served in New York these days, at 10 times the price.),So beguiling you could eat it when you have no appetite at all is the fresh, relatively mild chipotle, made from a jalapeÃ±o native to Oaxaca, stuffed with goat cheese, stewed pork, nuts, and raisins. The pepper is fried, then sauced with a deep, not-hot chili mixture. The famous mole poblano, served with chicken or pork, is equally delicious. Mole is often disappointing, but for those who still question whether the best Mexican dishes can vie with those from anywhere, this is the answer.,After the meal, I asked how the mole was made, and the mother-daughter team brought me a plate of the ground mixture of sun-dried chilies, almonds, chocolate, tortilla and who knows what else (it's got to be more than 20 ingredients) that make up the basic mix: It's sweet and savory, it's bitter, and it's got a kind of depth that can be achieved only by people who really understand chilies.,There are at least a couple of other worthwhile dishes: Manchamanteles (or tablecloth stainers, because they're so juicy), which are stews of meat and fruit. Mine contained chicken with ripe plantain, pear and apple, but they vary from season to season. And totopostles, which were delicious and reminded me of the Turkish kofte: meat (in this case pork) pounded with garlic and cumin, then shaped into a steak and grilled.,Casa Merlos has several rotating ""festivals,"" celebrations of seasonal dishes. March features loads of manchamanteles; in April, you'll see pumpkin flowers stuffed with various mixtures; and in October 10 moles appear on the menu.,This restaurant started in a poor neighborhood but has a new place in ritzy Las Palmas in Las Lomas de Chapultepec This is the one I visited â€” a beautiful space filled with ladies who lunch (or breakfast) and men in ties â€” and I'll head for the original next time I'm in town.,Start with the creamy, extraordinarily satisfying hot chocolate, poured from a jug. Or try one of the many jugos. I especially liked the mandarina and the guanabana (soursop), sweet, tart and not at all watery. One drinks jugos of all types in Mexico, and they can be thin and weak; these are anything but.,The sweet pastries, made with butter and probably lard, are irresistible: fig and coconut, an anise bun and the simple pan dulce are all supremely tender and tasty. If you get them served with nata â€” the equivalent of clotted cream â€” and you've had hot chocolate, you may be full. And happy.,But press on: The food shows strong influences from the state of Hidalgo, most notably the tortilla (omelet) con escamoles. These are the larvae of ants, but before you get too carried away with revulsion, let me remind you of caviar, which is also a weird little egg and is pretty good. So are these: white, small, with a soft but ""poppy"" texture and a subtle flavor that has hints of vanilla. In fact, in eggs it is too subtle, so you might, as I did, ask for a separate spoonful, simply cooked in butter, to really appreciate the stuff. There are other intriguing omelets, but you're not going to find this stuff at Zabar's, so why not give it a shot?,In any case, you must try the chilaquiles, which are the best I've ever eaten, perfectly cooked taco chips â€” still with some crispness, but tending toward tenderness, a difficult state to achieve â€” with onion, tomatillo, crumbled cheese, some spice and a lot of lime. The black beans with mozzarella-like cheese are also delicious.,The room is modern and tasteful, large and airy, with rust-colored walls and wood-and-leather chairs that match. Sun streams through windows facing the avenue, and there are windows on the other two sides,  a courtyard and a small park. There is no better place in town â€” maybe in the hemisphere â€” to spend a good portion of the morning eating so much you need to take a nap.,Just as visitors unavoidably find themselves on Fifth Avenue during the course of a few days in Manhattan, you will find yourself in Polanco if you're in Mexico City for more than a day or two; in fact, your hotel will probably be there. And there's at least one place (in addition to Izote and the new El Bajio) that's worth stopping in: That's D.O., short for denominacion de origen, the Spanish designation for distinctive regional foods. I wondered about including it here, because it's a stretch to call Spain a region of Mexico, and the chef, Bruna Oteiza, is a friend of mine. But for a drink and a few real tapas â€” the likes of which you'd have a hard time finding in the United States â€” it's fantastic.,You can get Jabugo ham here, the world's best, and some other classics: rabo de toro (bull's tail), a deep, dark, rich stew; various croquettes; little canapÃ©s of lomo (ham made of pork tenderloin) and piquillo peppers; or Camembert and anchovy (unusual and delicious). I like sitting at the bar, though  the dining room is appealing, with big windows and an elegant, informal, black-and-white dÃ©cor, and the main menu is alluring.,But the bar is of frosted orange glass, lighted internally, with a modern look and high-backed white chairs and old-fashioned chandeliers. And it's a bargain (some tapas are a buck) and, for some reason â€” at least on the nights I was there â€” not crowded, despite being among the most stylish places in the neighborhood.,I had two dreadful experiences trying to eat cuisine of the YucatÃ¡n before settling in at Xel-Ha the night before I left town. Lunch was at a downtown restaurant and entered the books as the worst meal of 2006; I'll spare you the details. An early dinner took place at a charming Yucatecan restaurant where the service was so bad we were forced to leave, though not until the server used the most novel excuse in history: ""The chef just died,"" he told us, placidly. (I'm almost positive this was a lie.),So on this night, McDonald's might have seemed terrific, and I thought of settling for tacos de carbÃ_n at a place I knew to be good. But from the minute I approached Xel-Ha I liked it, and I never stopped. First of all, it's in the heart of Condesa, which you might call the Lower East Side of Mexico City (though I'm quite sure I've never seen people juggling with fire at stoplights on Avenue B). Secondly, it's lively and, if not exactly gorgeous, unpretentious and cheery.,It was the tostado of turkey that made my evening, though: when a restaurant can produce turkey this juicy and delicious, there's someone in the kitchen who knows how to cook. Sopa de lima â€” lime soup â€” was rich chicken broth loaded with lime, some heat and tortilla chips; it was soothing. This was followed by some tacos with cochinita de pibil, the slow-roasted pork of the YucatÃ¡n (you're supposed to cook it in the ground, but I doubt they do that in Condesa); relleno negro, the classic pÃ¢tÃ©-like dish with black sauce, beautifully executed; and panucho cazÃ_n, essentially a shark sandwich. Suddenly I was liking Yucatecan food again. That's a good enough reason for me.,Prices are a rough average for a meal for two people with beverages.,, Victoriano Zepeda 80, Obsevatorio; (52-55) 5277-4360. 250 pesos, or about $23 at 11 pesos to the dollar.,Avenida de las Palmas 215, Lomas de Chapultepec; (52-55) 2623-0402.

"â€œI hope you know this is a rehearsal,â€ù said , near the close of her first set at the Stone on Saturday night. â€œNo, seriously,â€ù she added. â€œWe just got together today.â€ù,If that disclosure took people  by surprise, they didnâ€™t show it. Most of the audience had stood in line outside for an hour or longer to hear Ms. Wilson sing in this austere and intimate setting. She was working with musicians convened by the alto saxophonist and composer Steve Coleman, with whom she recorded her first few albums some 20 years ago. The experimental thrust of the evening was largely the point.,There was a deeper point too. Mr. Coleman and Ms. Wilson had agreed on a conceptual framework for their reunion: the West African system of divination known as Ifa, a central feature of Yoruba religious practice. Beside the stage, a posterboard diagram depicted the systemâ€™s 16 principal Odu, or stations of the human condition. The group had conceived music for four of them, Ms. Wilson said.,The first one began with a rustling rubato of hand-held shakers and drums and a self-assured invocation by the percussionist Pedro Martinez. Gradually a pulse emerged â€” four beats, then two, with a polyrhythmic clave pattern running underneath â€” as Mr. Coleman played one melodic fragment, and the pianist Jason Moran offered another. It was hazy and hypnotic: hardly the standard accompaniment for a jazz singer.,And when Ms. Wilson made her entrance, she was speaking, not singing. â€œOdu Eji Ogbe,â€ù she pronounced, in a ceremonial cadence. What followed was a regal recitation: â€œVictory over enemies/Spiritual awakenings/Long life/And peace of mind.â€ù Then came a scrap of song, sung in a deep drawl, as the band swirled around her.,Ms. Wilson seemed deeply happy to be nestled within the ensemble. She traded a few improvised lines with another vocalist, the less commanding but agile Jen Shyu, and occasionally turned around to engage directly with the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the drummer Dafnis Prieto. The apparent ideal was collective polyphony, rather than an arrangement of accompanists behind a lead.,There were a few bracing solos along the way nonetheless: by the guitarist Marvin Sewell and the tenor saxophonist Yosvany Terry, as well as by Mr. Coleman. And Ms. Wilson ventured some surefooted scat choruses over a rhythmically complex groove halfway through â€œOyeku,â€ù a song that she connected lyrically to the blues.,By the end of the set the group had pushed itself toward a churning cohesion. Ms. Wilson was smiling broadly, as was Mr. Coleman. They had pulled off an uneven but impressively exploratory performance, or â€” perhaps more accurately â€” a deeply promising rehearsal. The only remaining question is where that preparation will lead.",NATE CHINEN,"JAN. 29, 2007",West African Religion Lends a Spiritual Framework to a Jazz Exploration,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/arts/music/29wils.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WHETHER you arrive in Calcata by car or by one of the  buses from ,, it is impossible to remain unfazed when the village first comes into sight. Perched high atop a cake-shaped stump of tan volcanic rock â€” studded with a diminutive chess-piece castle and fringed by a dense forest â€” the fortified village plays on the travelersâ€™ collective myth of the quintessential Italian hill town.,But navigate the S-shaped passageway to the marble bench-lined piazza in the middle of this bewitching village, about 30 miles north of Rome, and something might seem amiss. Maybe itâ€™s the fresco of Jimi Hendrix painted on the wall of an 18th-century building. Or the ponytailed locals, some of whom might be milling about in Indian-style saris. Or the absurd number of art galleries tucked away in the tangle of cobblestone alleyways. Whatever it is, it doesnâ€™t take long to figure out that Calcata is not your everyday Italian hill town.,This may be the grooviest village in Italy, home to a wacky community of about 100 artists, bohemians, aging hippies and New Age types. Its offbeat roots began in the 1930s, when the government condemned the medieval village for fear that the craggy cliffs it sits on were crumbling. Calcataâ€™s inhabitants relocated a half mile up the road to a newly built town, Calcata Nuova, and except for a clutch of feral cats and a few holdouts, the old hilltop village lay deserted, awaiting a government wrecking crew.,Then, in the late â€™60s and early â€™70s, artists and bohemians began gravitating to the village, drawn by its rugged beauty and a mythical energy that  some say emanates from Calcataâ€™s 150-foot-high volcanic stump. (The Faliscans, a pre-Roman people, used the mountain as a sacred ritual site, and some transplants say they can still feel the spiritual force.),The new artsy inhabitants squatted in the abandoned stone houses before buying them (the original owners were happy to sell). They patched up potholes in the cobblestone alleys and transformed many of the caves under the village into subterranean homes. They opened art galleries, restaurants and cafes. And, finally, they successfully lobbied to have Calcataâ€™s death sentence rescinded, convincing the government that the earlier assessment was wrong.,â€œWe saved Calcata by moving here,â€ù said Athon Veggi, an artist and Egyptologist who moved to the village in the 1970s and now lives in two adjacent caves: one for her art work, the other she shares with a dozen crows. â€œPeople like myself came here because itâ€™s a powerful place and because weâ€™re free to do what we want.â€ù,In truth, Calcata has had its share of the bizarre long before the bohemians arrived. Shortly after the Sack of Rome in 1527, when the city was plundered by the armies of Emperor Charles V, a German soldier showed up in Calcata carrying a souvenir he had stolen during the raid: the supposed foreskin of Jesus. The soldier was captured, and the Holy Foreskin was confiscated, permanently placing Calcata on the weird relics map.,The Holy Foreskin, however, mysteriously disappeared in 1983 (locals swear the Vatican took it). Since then, pilgrims have been replaced by gallery-hopping day-trippers, who come to gawk instead at Calcataâ€™s medieval architecture and the paese di fricchettoni, or village of freaks.,â€œThat almost all the inhabitants are from somewhere else â€” either in Italy or other parts of the world â€” makes Calcata unique,â€ù said Pancho Garrison, a former choreographer from Texas who runs Grotta dei Germogli, a nouvelle Italian restaurant in a mosaic-lined cave (Rupe San Giovanni; 39-761-588-003; ,). â€œBut what really inspires me is that everyone you encounter here has a creative bent.â€ù,Take, for example, Marijcke van der Maden, a Dutch puppet-maker, who came here in the early  â€™80s and now organizes jam sessions with local musicians, classical music concerts, lectures and exhibitions in the Granarone (Via di Porta Segreta, 8; 39-0761-587-855; , ), a spacious hall with an earthy cafe that serves as the villageâ€™s de facto visitorsâ€™ center. Or the painter Giancarlo Croce, who runs a subterranean gallery, Studio dâ€™Arte Porta Segreta (Via Porta Segreta, 15; 39-761-587-563), that carries the works of the local sculptor Costantino Morosin, who is known throughout Italy for his sculptures made of a volcanic rock, tufo, including the three Etruscan-style thrones that grace Calcataâ€™s square. Or the flamboyant Gianni Macchia, an actor from 1970s B-movies, who loves showing off his coffee house, Caffe Kafir (Via Garibaldi 12-14; 39-338-172-5339), and the mural-filled palace that houses it.,The artistic inspiration has spread outside the village. Just below Calcata, a sprawling patch of forest has been turned into a rambling art gallery, the Opera Bosco (LocalitÃ  Colle; 39-761-588-048; ,). A pleasant 20-minute walk from town, it has sculptures and art installations created from local materials like tufo, wooden branches and dirt.,But not everyone is attracted to Calcata for its artistic vibe, spiritual energy or relics. The physical aesthetic of Calcata â€”  one of the best preserved medieval hill towns in Italy,  is reason enough to draw people like Prince Stefano Massimo, who hails from one of the oldest noble families in Europe (and whose family owned Calcata in the 19th century). He lives part-time in a mansion that sprawls along the southeastern half of the village, and is composed of five homes that were combined and refashioned by a local architect, Patrizia Crisanti.,â€œI try to come here as much as possible,â€ù Mr. Massimo said. â€œNot for the energy that people speak about, or for the artists who are living here, but because where else could you find a place that looks this beautiful.â€ù,Calcata is also charmingly backward. There are many places to get a tarot card reading or a box of incense, but to withdraw money from an A.T.M., mail a letter or other modern conveniences, you have to drive to Calcata Nuova or three miles to Faleria.,Still, for most Calcata residents, itâ€™s a fair trade-off. â€œYou could walk around here in your pajamas holding a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, and no one is going to judge you because youâ€™re not tied to the proper Italian way of doing things,â€ù said Mr. Garrison. â€œThat says a lot about the place.â€ù,Although the village is a popular day-trip destination, spending the night is the best way to get a real sense of Calcata. I Sensi della Terra (Via San Giovanni 1, 39-0761-587-733; ,) rents rooms and apartments scattered throughout the village. The rooms start at 20 euros, $38, at $1.29 to the euro. And if the villagers are having one of their potluck pasta dinners on the square, they may invite you to join them. Just make sure you donâ€™t have any plans in the morning.,For a place that isnâ€™t stereotypically Italy, it can be pretty Italian after all.,Driving is the easiest way to get to Calcata. From ,, it is a 30-mile trip on highway Cassia Bis (SS2); exit at Sette Vene and follow signs for Calcata. You can also reach Calcata  by bus. Take one of the light-rail trains from the Ferrovia Nord station in Rome to the Saxa Rubra bus terminal (a 20-minute ride that costs 1 euro, or $1.29) and switch to a blue Cotral bus (,) that stops at Calcata. Buses leave almost every hour, and the ride takes about 45 minutes. Tickets are sold at the snack bar, Bar Saxa; a one-way ticket is 2 euros.",DAVID FARLEY,"JAN. 28, 2007","Calcata, Italy: Where Newcomers Gave an Old Town a Second Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/travel/28dayout.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IT'S a warm weekend evening and it looks as if a hipster convention has descended upon Culver City. On La Cienega, the sidewalk teems with the spillover from the opening of a video installation at the LAXart gallery. At Mandrake, a bar a few doors down, the D.J. plays the White Stripes while artists in distressed denim ignore the Werner Herzog movie playing in the background.,Meanwhile, in the center of town, Ford's Filling Station is crammed with executive types from the Sony Pictures Studios lot who have come for a happy hour hefeweizen, and coiffed couples are wolfing down their smoked trout salad in order to make it across the street to the Kirk Douglas Theater before the curtain goes up.,Ask a resident of Culver City what this , neighborhood was like just a few years ago, and you'll hear a list of depressing descriptors: â€œa wasteland,â€ù â€œrough,â€ù â€œold and rundown.â€ù â€œIt was desolation boulevard,â€ù says Timothy Blum, whose Blum & Poe gallery opened here in 2003. â€œIt was devoid of any kind of life â€” it was mostly known as Wheel Alley, a place where people came to get tires.â€ù,Clearly, things have changed. Culver City, once considered a place to drive by on your way to somewhere else, has become Los Angeles's newest stylish neighborhood, a magnet for lovers of the arts, good food and culture. One part Hollywood nostalgia, one part modern design, the city-within-a-city now inspires expressions like â€œnascent Chelseaâ€ù and â€œL.A.'s new restaurant mecca.â€ù,Culver City's primary appeal has always been that it's close to everything else: just east of Santa Monica and Venice, just south of Beverly Hills, just north of the Los Angeles airport. The only thing actually in Culver City, historically, was movie studios: the grandly colonnaded Ince Studios (which soon became MGM, and then, 70 years later, Sony) moved in not long after the city was founded by a developer in 1913. The Munchkins and bootleggers came next: â€œThe Wizard of Ozâ€ù was filmed here in the 1930s, back when the area was still known for its gambling dens and Prohibition-era nightclubs.,But by the 1970s the city had gone into decline and vanished off the Los Angeles cultural map: a home to middle-class families, car dealerships and low-rent factories. It wasn't until the late 1990s, when a citywide redevelopment push began, that things turned around. Today, Culver City boasts kitschy new 1950s-style signs, which match the vintage architecture of downtown; the brand-new Kirk Douglas Theater and the Actor's Gang (Tim Robbins was a co-founder) are drawing significant plays; and even the historic Culver Hotel, where the Munchkins once slept, has had a makeover.,At the center of Culver City's turnaround is the Helms Furniture District â€” a blocklong Moderne monolith, once the famous Helms bakery, now (thanks to the developer Walter N. Marks III) home to a dozen furniture and design stores, a jazz club and two restaurants. At one end of the building is the acclaimed Asian-fusion small-plates restaurant ,; at the other is H. D. Buttercup, a 100,000-square-foot depot crammed with designer furnishings. Here, you can buy an antique Balinese Buddha, a Blu Dot storage console and a reproduction of Mies van der Rohe's famous Barcelona chairs in one dizzying go, and recover with a plate of moules mariniÃ¨res at Le Dijonaise, the bistro next door.,A few blocks away, where Washington Boulevard meets La Cienega, visitors can find the other reason for Culver City's renaissance: more than two dozen contemporary art galleries, every one of which has opened in the last four years. The respected Blum & Poe gallery was the first to arrive here, drawn by the airy (and inexpensive) old brick warehouses, and was quickly followed by galleries like Anna Helwing, sixspace and LAXart. The area has supplanted , and , as Los Angeles's center for cutting-edge and conceptual art; on weekends, the funky-spectacle crowd comes for the Sam Durant and Sharon Lockhart openings, and stays for drinks at Mandrake.,For years Culver City was on the culinary map only as the home of Surfas, the legendary restaurant supply store. But since 2004, nearly a dozen restaurants â€” most with an eye toward organic and casual fine cuisine â€” have opened in a neighborhood once known as a culinary no man's land.,At Ford's Filling Station, an industrial brick gastropub, the chef Benjamin Ford (son of Harrison) serves high-end pub fare like steak sandwiches and flatbread pizza with grilled shrimp and white bean hummus. Tender Greens, right next door, is a high-concept salad stop where the market greens are so fresh you can practically taste photosynthesis in action. Beacon and Wilson anchor the expensive end of the dining spectrum, and, to wash it all down, there's BottleRock, a wine bar and shop with a mind-boggling list of 800 vintages, a well-edited menu of charcuterie and small plates, and a clientele that packs the chrome stools every night of the week.,Down the road, there's even an affordable cooking school: the New School of Cooking, which offers instruction in everything from essential knife skills to Burmese cuisine. And a half-dozen new restaurants and wine bars â€” including an outpost of the Santa Monica burger institution Father's Office â€” are due to open in the coming year.,â€œRestaurants are spilling into Culver City because there's nowhere else to go,â€ù says the chef Michael Wilson. He chose Culver City as the location of his new restaurant Wilson â€” Culver City's most ambitious endeavor, serving dishes like truffled pasta and slow-roasted pork with cherry sauce â€” over the tonier (and more crowded, competitive and pricey) neighborhoods of Beverly Hills or Santa Monica. â€œThe rents are a lot lower so you can really get away without charging astronomical prices for good food,â€ù he said. â€œIn five or six years you won't even recognize Washington Boulevard â€” it will be the new little restaurant row.â€ù,Wilson is wedged into the corner of Washington Boulevard's new MODAA building, a glowing, Lego-like yellow and gray box that houses live-work lofts, a design museum and an architecture firm. Architecture has quickly become another of Culver City's new calling cards: Some of Los Angeles's best-known architects, such as Pugh + Scarpa, are based here. South of Washington Boulevard, the Hayden Tract is perhaps the most unusual clutch of avant-garde buildings in all Los Angeles: a formerly derelict strip turned into eye-popping offices by the deconstructivist architect Eric Owen Moss, now housing advertising firms, a dance studio and the photography studio Smashbox Studios (home to Los Angeles's fashion week).,Despite the new growth, though, Culver City still doesn't feel much like a city: the boulevards are wide and the buildings low, streets are often empty of traffic (both car and pedestrian), and even on Friday night the restaurants stop seating at 10 p.m. If you're looking for a party, in other words, look elsewhere.,But that, say the new locals, is exactly why they are moving here. â€œThere is a feeling of openness here,â€ù says the New School of Cooking owner Anne Smith, a seven-year resident. â€œIt's still a city on the verge. It still has character, which is what makes Culver City great. My personal hope is that it doesn't ever become Santa Monica.â€ù,8631 Washington Boulevard, (310) 287-2093; ,.

"The traveling sideshow of  â€œPagliacciâ€ù added a strongman act to its clowns, acrobats and derailed theatrical entertainments on Friday night. Salvatore Licitra was scheduled to sing Leoncavalloâ€™s Canio at the ,, while Frank Porretta would be Mascagniâ€™s Turiddu in â€œCavalleria Rusticana.â€ù On Thursday Mr. Porretta reported in sick. Rather than let a cover singer be called for, Mr. Licitra said he would sing both operas.,Given the flat-out vocal and emotional muscle each part requires, not to mention the Metâ€™s vast acoustical space needing to be filled, pitching tenorial woo at both ends of a doubleheader is not unheard of, but it is to be remarked on when it happens. Going 9 innings is the normal aim, 18 a rarity these days.,Mr. Licitraâ€™s only uneasy moments came oddly at the beginning, during his curtain-raising offstage aria in â€œCavalleria.â€ù He has a clear sound and a musical sense that is mostly enlightened if betrayed occasionally by small crudenesses of attack. He  has developed the top of his voice carefully, but he can be wary of it, wisely turning down the flame when trouble threatens. On the other hand, when either opera needed full commitment, nothing was withheld. Tough evenings like this require management of resources.,With only a day to orient himself, Mr. Licitra seemed comfortable on Franco Zeffirelliâ€™s venerable set for â€œCavalleria.â€ù In the pre-duel spat with Alfio (Mark Delavan) his teeth found his opponentâ€™s ear with perfect aim. The shutting of church doors in Santuzzaâ€™s face also had a nice theatrical flourish to it. Mr. Licitra runs a lot in both operas, which helps keep things moving.,Marco Armiliato conducted, as he did earlier in the season. The appealing Dolora Zajick was a blast furnace of a Santuzza; with her and Mr. Licitra on either side, Mr. Delavan sounded a little underpowered.,In â€œPagliacciâ€ù I very much admired the vocal completeness of Krassimiraâ€™s Stoyanovaâ€™s Nedda.

"In a city known for bakeries, bread and breakfasts, the scene just continues to get better. For whatever reason â€” gold miners ate big breakfasts? the hills build morning appetites? the sea air? â€” , has always had breakfast food worth traveling for. (The corned beef hash at Campton Place about 20 years ago was as interesting as any dinner entree served locally at the time.),That breakfasts here are, or should be, the envy of every place else in the country strikes me as practically inarguable. It's not the sourdough bread (an overrated local aberration, one of the gold miners' true legacies), but the good dairy products  (Sonoma still produces them) and the love and respect for tender baked goods, whether sweet, savory or in combination.,San Francisco now has one of the best French-style bakeries as well â€” run by, no less, a transplanted New Yorker named Elizabeth  Pruitt. The place is ,, and it is â€” like many things new and exciting â€” in the Mission District.,I first fell in love with Tartine's scones last spring, when I was in town reporting a story, and several people insisted I get myself over there. Logically, Tartine's scones  shouldn't be any better than anyone else's, because the recipe is pretty much standard: a ton of butter, some flour and sugar, not much else.,It could be that other bakeries don't use as much butter as they should, or it could be that Tartine's ingredients are better: Ms. Pruitt and her husband, Chad Robertson â€” who works mostly on the bread side â€” insist they determinedly rely on local suppliers for nearly everything, and use organic ingredients whenever possible. In any case, the scones are tender (Ms. Pruitt knows enough not to overhandle the dough, of course), they're crumbly, they're just sweet enough.,And moving beyond them: The croissant is the best I've had on the West Coast â€” flaky, buttery, crisp, greasy. (Yes. A croissant should leave you licking your fingers. It is butter fragilely encased in flour.),And then there are the sandwiches, made with Mr. Robertson's exceptional bread, notable because it's a slow-fermented yeast bread in very French style that is a welcome change from the ubiquitous sourdough.,The sweets are right up there with the croissant and scones. The French classics like the layered opera cake and crunchy frangipane tart are awesome, but I crave the very American lemon meringue cake, brought to the point of overkill with a layer of caramel. I don't know the reason â€” the quality (or quantity) of the butter? Ms. Pruitt's touch? the beguiling nature of The City, as they call it? â€” but this is my favorite bakery in the United States.,Tartine Bakery, 600 Guerrero Street at 18th, (415) 487-2600; ,.",MARK BITTMAN,"JAN. 28, 2007",San Francisco: Tartine Bakery,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/travel/28Bite.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WITH its brightly painted houses and Muslim melting pot, the Bo Kaap neighborhood of , may not seem like a foodie's delight. It was settled in the 17th century by slaves from India, Malaysia and other southeast Asian countries, who became known as Cape Malays. And their food, odd fusion dishes like bobotie (curried beef with egg custard) and sosatie (a Mediterranean-style kebab marinated with Indian curry), was largely regarded as working-class fare.,But with the Cape Malays' sweet and spicy mix of Asian, European and Mediterranean flavors now showing up at haute restaurants around Cape Town and beyond, that is starting to change.,Take, for starters, the biriyani at the , (10 Hospital Street, 27-21-421-4682; ,), a chic new restaurant opened by a top chef, Bruce Robertson, who once worked with Gordon Ramsay in London. Instead of the traditional spices and yogurt that make up this aromatic Indian dish, Mr. Robertson adheres to an old Cape Malay recipe and uses fennel, a soft-boiled quail egg and lentils, albeit with a more refined touch.,â€œCape Malay is a mature taste,â€ù Mr. Robertson said in explaining the cuisine's newfound appeal. â€œIt's genuine food, proper food, and it's South Africa's home cooking.â€ù,Another tastemaker, Craig Paterson, the chef at onewaterfront, a modern restaurant with harbor views (West Quay, V & A Waterfront, 27-21-410-7100), has turned his kitchen into a kind of Cape Malay laboratory, coaxing new flavors out of old ingredients.,â€œWherever possible, I have tried to incorporate the influence of Malay spices,â€ù said Mr. Paterson, whose restaurant is inside the elegant Cape Grace Hotel, which counts Bill Clinton and BeyoncÃ© among its famous guests. The current menu includes a duck bobotie, a coriander-encrusted kingklip and a biryani-style saffron seafood risotto.,The dishes may be nouvelle, but they are very much in keeping with the Cape Malays' origins. The southeast Asian slaves, who were brought to Cape Town by the Dutch East India Company, found themselves without access to their favorite ingredients like coconut milk (a staple of Malay cooking) and tamarind (a favorite spice of South Indians).,So they began adapting their recipes and invented a new style of cooking.

"Impatience is a virtue, and an organizing principle, for Deerhoof, the San Francisco band that headlined at Irving Plaza on Friday night.,Nothing lingers overtime in a Deerhoof song. Satomi Matsuzaki, on bass, sings bright, poppy tunes full of nonsense syllables in a piping voice, only to stop suddenly and join Greg Saunier on drums and John Dieterich on guitar in a burly hard-rock riff, which sputters into stop-start drumming, which switches to odd-meter funk, which might surge back into a pop tune or come to a crashing halt. The only guarantee is that something dynamically different will show up within seconds, as the songs whipsaw from delicacy to brute force without warning.,Deerhoofâ€™s music compresses the elaborate structures of progressive rock for the attention span and sample-happy aesthetics of hip-hop. Itâ€™s a pastiche that can, at various moments, suggest any of the last four decades, and thereâ€™s often a utopian longing in the lyrics that recalls the 1960s: â€œWe will go reeling/seekers of a world to be,â€ù Ms. Matsuzaki sang in â€œThe Galaxist,â€ù a song from Deerhoofâ€™s new album, â€œFriend Opportunityâ€ù (Kill Rock Stars/5 Rue Christine).,But the constant swerves and jolts are contemporary. Deerhoofâ€™s continuing challenge is to keep them from becoming predictable: not just alternating loud and soft, but constantly reshuffling tempos and textures, annexing new idioms and, especially in more recent songs, letting melodies breathe before demolishing them, so the music isnâ€™t simply a feat of memory and execution. After four years as a quartet, Deerhoof returned last year to the same trio lineup it had in 2002, but without sacrificing variety onstage. On Friday night, Deerhoof played for the length of a punk-rock or hip-hop set â€” only about an hour â€” but delivered enough ideas to leave both band and audience satiated and buzzing.,Busdriver, an underground rapper from Los Angeles, shared the bill and presented his own kind of overload: rhymes in tricky accelerating and decelerating meters that often shifted into triple and quadruple speed. His D.J. supplied stark electronic beats, often close to techno and drum-and-bass.,Within the barrage of syllables were inventive rhymes â€” â€œrecreational paranoiaâ€ù and â€œkill your employerâ€ù â€” and complex commentary on politics and culture, not shying away from vocabulary like â€œoligarchy.â€ù But as Busdriver switched between speed-rapping and an occasional mocking pop croon, he put the songs across with as much comedy as self-righteousness.,Proton Proton, a Brooklyn band, opened the show with lean, hard-riffing, changeable rockers driven by an unusual instrument: the gass, a combination of guitar and bass.",JON PARELES,"JAN. 29, 2007",Restless Quick-Draw McGraws,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/arts/music/29deer.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28 â€”  The orange and blue neon lights of the Castro Theater shone blurrily on the damp asphalt beneath the crisscrossing catenary wires of the streetcars. The words on the marquee in the Friday night gloom, read: â€œMarsha Hunt: In Person.â€ù,Ms. Hunt made more than 50 movies before her career was wrecked in 1950 by the Hollywood  blacklist. One of them, a 1948 crime melodrama called , has gone on to an unlikely second life as a favorite of the cultish devotees of film noir. On Friday it opened the fifth annual Noir City film festival here, and Ms. Hunt, 89, was on hand to watch its dreamlike silvery hues make a rare appearance on a big â€”  very big   â€” screen.,Lithe and glowing, Ms. Hunt took the stage after the film   and said she was surprised not only that this dark little B movie had found fans nearly 60 years after its release, but that so many of them were here, nearly filling the Castroâ€™s more than 1,400 seats. The crowd was a mix of young and old, polished and scruffy, with only a few fedoras in sight.,â€œI canâ€™t get over this,â€ù Ms. Hunt said as the film festivalâ€™s founder and organizer, Eddie Muller, genially interviewed her at the foot of the stage. â€œIt was a strange sort of film,â€ù she added,  â€œabout as negative as you can get. They hadnâ€™t coined the term â€˜noirâ€™ yet.â€ù,Sheâ€™s right. Itâ€™s hard to imagine a darker film,  literally or figuratively, than â€œRaw Deal.â€ù Consisting almost entirely of luminescent day-for-night photography, itâ€™s the story of an escaped con (played by Dennis Oâ€™Keefe) and the two women who love him (Ms. Hunt was one; Claire Trevor was the other), and features, among other pitch-black set pieces, a villain (Raymond Burr) who disfigures his girlfriend with a flaming dessert, and a furious midnight brawl in a seaside taxidermy shop. At the end everyone is either ruined, dead or under arrest.,And that darkness was just fine with the moviegoers here, which applauded vigorously as the closing titles rolled, just as they had at the beginning when the credit for the filmâ€™s director of photography, John Alton, the master of all that darkness, appeared on screen.,Mr. Muller, an author and film noir aficionado, dreamed up the film festival five years ago as a way to  increase visibility for the Film Noir Foundation he runs, which works to restore the movies, and to promote his own books. (He most recently  helped write  Tab Hunterâ€™s autobiography.) The Castro, built in 1922 and recently refurbished, had some dead time in January, and the festival (which runs this year through Feb. 4)  was born â€” with a bang. The first double bill in 2003, , and , â€” two seminal San Francisco noirs â€” sold out.,â€œIt was huge right out of the gate,â€ù he said. â€ùIt totally threw me.â€ù In the years since, heâ€™s sold an average of 880 seats a night.,Of course  subject matter and city are well matched. San Francisco has a noir pedigree rivaling that of New York or Los Angeles, its fog, slanting streets, circa-1940â€™s office buildings and dank narrow streets creating untold scores of blind alleys for characters unlucky enough to be trapped in them. Several  noirs, including â€œRaw Deal,â€ù  have been set here.,On Friday the weather didnâ€™t disappoint, with a steady rain falling much of the day. The sun made a half-hearted attempt to appear around noon, then gave up and went back to bed.,The Noir City festival may not be Sundance, but it too has its celebrities and scenes. Before â€œRaw Dealâ€ù on Friday the Castroâ€™s balcony was crammed for a reception, with an open bar, a jazz band and Ms. Hunt signing copies of her book, â€œThe Way We Wore: Styles of the 1930s and â€™40s and Our World Since Thenâ€ù (Fallbrook, 1993).,Among those on hand was Richard Erdman, 81, a character actor whose face is as recognizable â€” his credits include , and , â€” as his name is unknown. He had a supporting role in , the first film on Saturday nightâ€™s double bill, and looked so familiar standing there at the reception that it was almost impossible not to run up to him and say, â€œHavenâ€™t we met before?â€ù,Like Ms. Hunt, Mr. Erdman seemed  a little puzzled  as to why exactly, so many years later, these movies are finding a new following. Asked for a theory, he thought for a moment and said: â€œI really have no idea. Iâ€™m not putting it down, I just donâ€™t understand it.â€ù,He heaped praise on Mr. Muller and his crew of volunteers for running a high-class operation. â€œTheyâ€™re not chintzy,â€ù he said, sipping a glass of white wine.,Film noir is enjoying something of a second golden age at the moment. In addition to the San Francisco festival, the Film Forum in New York City offered a major noir series last year, and studios like Warner Brothers and Fox have ratcheted up their noir reissues to such an extent that many films that never made it out on VHS are  appearing on DVD. Just last  week Warner  Home Video released 1952â€™s , starring Robert Mitchum, which had only been available on foreign or pirated VHS tapes. Mr. Muller provides the commentary track.,â€œWith film noir, if you show it to a group of 20-year-olds, theyâ€™ll find something to get hooked on,â€ù said George Feltenstein, Warner Home Videoâ€™s  voluble senior vice president for marketing for  its classic catalog. â€œThere is a sexiness to it, there is a mystery took it. These are very seductive movies, they are not cookie-cutter.â€ù,Warner Brothers has released three noir box sets. The first, which came out in 2004 and featured titles like  , and , hit No. 1 on Amazon.comâ€™s DVD list.  This year Warnerâ€™s fourth noir set will include 10 rather than 5 movies. Hereâ€™s a scoop for noir fans: Two will star Mr. Mitchum.,Whatever the machinations of the DVD business, here at the Noir City festival, everyone was in a pretty good mood by the time the second title of opening night, , a super-rarity from 1942, rolled to its conclusion. This one had a  happier ending, with Ms. Hunt getting a marriage proposal, delivered beneath a  microscope, from a skinny and surprisingly big-haired Van Heflin.,Coats and fedoras went back on, and the crowd headed for the exits.  Ms. Hunt stood by the door, shaking hands and signing autographs, as her new legions of fans emerged onto the shiny street and headed off into the night.",WENDELL JAMIESON,"JAN. 29, 2007","Beyond a Shadow of a Doubt, Nights Are Noir in Fog City",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/movies/29noir.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NEWARK, Jan. 26 â€” When an obscure Russian company comes to town for a one-off performance of a classical ballet, you never know what to expect. The latest example was the State Ballet Theater of Russia, the touring name of the Voronezh State Theater of Opera and Ballet, a group formed in 1961. Its presentation of Vladimir Vasilievâ€™s â€œCinderellaâ€ù at the ,  departed liberally from the programâ€™s synopsis, based on Nikolai Volkovâ€™s 1940s libretto.,A sampling of the characters and props missing from the stage included Cinderellaâ€™s father, the portrait of her mother, a broom with which she is meant to dance a tender pas de deux, dragonflies in a magic forest, the pumpkin and a jester at the princeâ€™s palace. The most bewildering tactic surely had to be when the curtain fell intentionally to signal intermission â€” smack dab in the middle of the second-act ball.,Yet for all its awkward moments, as an overall production â€œCinderellaâ€ù was full of enchantment. Along with a live orchestra performing Prokofievâ€™s score, lovely scenery by Viktor Volsky and graceful costumes that worked within a vibrant and pastel color scheme by Rafail Volsky,  this fairy tale came to life.,There was nothing confusing about the appeal of Svetlana Noskova as Cinderella. With her exquisite feet and gracious performance quality, Ms. Noskova grasped the sweet sincerity of her role. As her attentive, handsome prince, Ivan Alexeev was the archetype of youthful nobility. And Ekaterina Liubikhâ€™s Enchantress â€” otherwise known as the fairy godmother â€” was all refinement.,The rest of the young cast, including the fairies, lacked sufficient strength and stage presence to pull off their variations with the poise of the balletâ€™s leads. Tatiana Sidorova and Alina Taranzhina played the spoiled stepsisters, but as Cinderellaâ€™s stepmother, Vladislav Ivanov, bronzed and redheaded, was overly broad.,The gnomes, more in keeping with Snow Whiteâ€™s seven dwarfs (there were 9 or 10 depending on the scene, but there should have been 12 to represent the hands of a clock), were distractingly thuggish. Here and throughout the ballet Mr. Vasilievâ€™s fussy choreography frequently seemed at odds with the music.,But especially for the dozens of attentive, Cinderella-obsessed young ladies in the audience, including one who turned to flash an ecstatic grin when it was over, the ballet was deliverance. Their girl got the guy in the end and looked pretty doing it. And that counts.",GIA KOURLAS,"JAN. 29, 2007","No Pumpkin and No Dancing Broom, but Cinderella Still Finds Love",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/arts/dance/29cind.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Players in duplicate tournaments win only master points, no prizes. And they strive to attain the rank of life master. You must gain 300 points, at least 50 being silver points, which can be won only in sectional tournaments. Earlier this month the Greater New York Bridge Association ran a â€œSTaCâ€ù â€”  for Sectional Tournaments at Clubs â€” week. These pair events were played simultaneously in the clubs across the city.,The diagramed deal was played Jan. 18, and it helped Justine Cushing and Barry Rigal of New York to second place behind Joan Hight and Phyllis Young, also of New York.,When you uncover a good fit with your partner, the strength of your hand increases. There are two commonly used methods of evaluation. First, you can add points for short suits. Here each doubleton is worth one point, giving North a total of nine. This would suggest raising to two spades, with the intention of accepting a game-try by partner, or of competing to three spades if the opponents enter the auction.,Second, you can use the Losing Trick Count. You look at no more than the first three cards in every suit, counting one loser for each top honor missing. The North hand has eight losers: three spades, two hearts, one diamond and two clubs. This makes the hand worth a game-invitational raise to three spades, which was the bid chosen by Cushing. (Perhaps the best approach with a borderline hand is to underbid slightly in a pair event, where you do not push for thin games, but to overbid in a team event or Chicago, where you bid game with any excuse.),A club, heart or high-spade start would have defeated four spades, but West had a natural diamond lead. (She was using Rusinow leads, so selected the jack, the second-highest of touching honors.),Declarer immediately discarded two heart losers on dummyâ€™s top diamonds, then called for a club. East went up with his ace, cashed the heart ace and continued with the heart king. South ruffed, took his top trumps and club king, ruffed a club on the board (West discarded a diamond) and trumped a diamond in his hand to give this unusual finish:,When did you last see four singleton queens in a three-card end position?,South led his club jack, leaving West with no winning play. If she had ruffed, declarer would have crossruffed the last two tricks. If West had thrown the heart queen, declarer would have ruffed the club jack on the board and trumped a diamond in his hand. And when West pitched her diamond queen, South ruffed on the board and discarded his last club on the high diamond nine.",PHILLIP ALDER,"JAN. 29, 2007","In the Buzz of Club Activity, a Cluster of Singleton Queens",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/crosswords/bridge/29card.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"THIRTY percent of Internet users still do not trust technology enough to buy something online. But will they use the Web to buy security software?,The Internet service provider EarthLink hopes that they will. The company said it would announce new security services today, to be available to both EarthLink users and others, aimed at thwarting new hacking techniques that specialists regard as particularly insidious. The new services could also help EarthLink fortify its flagging bottom line and reduce customer service calls from users afflicted by computer viruses.,â€œThe whole axis of the world is moving toward an Internet-based economy,â€ù said Craig Forman, an EarthLink executive vice president, who, among other things, oversees sales of security services. â€œSecurity is a critical portion of the success of that economy.â€ù,The new feature, called Attack Shield, is a premium offering intended to complement the companyâ€™s Protection Control Center security service, which EarthLink subscribers receive free. Attack Shield will cost EarthLink subscribers $24 annually, or $3 a month. Those who are not members, but who pay $36 annually or $4 monthly for the Protection Control Center service, will receive Attack Shield at no added cost.,Attack Shield relies on technology from Sana Security, a software vendor based in San Mateo, Calif.,  that specializes in what is known as behavior-based intrusion detection methods. Such programs essentially watch a personal computer for suspicious-looking software  â€” for instance, applications  hidden in remote areas of the computer that then replicate themselves, or programs that load themselves onto a PC unbidden.,Antivirus software companies like McAfee, Symantec and others, using conventional Internet security methods, find a copy of such a malicious program, identify a signature string of computer code unique to it, then circulate to customers a software application to block programs with that signature.,The signature-based approach, though, does little for those who are victimized by a new attack before security companies have had a chance to obtain the programâ€™s signature and circulate an antidote. And because many hackers now are sophisticated financial criminals, rather than the rascals  of old, their programs are more likely to mutate so quickly that the signature they leave on one personâ€™s computer could look nothing like the signature left on someone elseâ€™s machine.,These new â€œmalwareâ€ù programs, as they are known in the computer security field, are the most popular distribution method for programs that have turned an estimated 11 percent of the worldâ€™s computers into â€œzombieâ€ù machines used in fraud, spam distribution and online identity theft.,By opening a new front in cyber crime, hackers have also opened a new market for security companies. This month, Symantec announced a  behavior-based detection technology, called Sonar, to thwart malware intrusions, and analysts said other  companies were working hard to introduce competing technology or refine what they already have.,EarthLink has offered Attack Shield on a trial basis since early in the month, according to Mr. Forman, who declined to say how many customers the service had.,â€œMost of the users are EarthLink customers, but weâ€™re very happy with its progress among those who arenâ€™t EarthLink customers,â€ù he said. â€œThis is part of our strategy to widen out the potential universe of folks who EarthLink can reach. And security is a huge part of why our existing members are loyal to EarthLink.â€ù,He said the security service was also an important way for EarthLink to increase revenue as it tries to persuade Attack Shield users to become full EarthLink subscribers. The company lost $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2006, the latest quarter for which EarthLink has reported financial results. Revenue increased 4.5 percent over the 2005 quarter, to $331.3 million.,EarthLink, like AOL,  has struggled to grow amid heavy competition from cable Internet providers and phone companies. It has had to glean revenue from its 5.3 million existing customers by selling them more services like Internet telephony and online video subscriptions.,Such efforts have paid dividends, Mr. Forman said, as well as the companyâ€™s emphasis on selling security services. â€œSecurity is very much a moneymaker for us,â€ù he said.,According to Andrew Jacquith, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm based in Boston, the Attack Shield effort is likely to appeal to a small percentage of the market at first, even though he said it was â€œa step aheadâ€ù of other security services in effectiveness and simplicity.,â€œA certain amount of education needs to happen before customers figure out that this is what theyâ€™ll want to have,â€ù Mr. Jacquith said. â€œSo having companies like EarthLink behind it will help a lot.â€ù He added that other Internet providers would offer similar services to their customers in the coming months, accelerating the process.,The consumer market for security software, which the research firm IDC said reached $1.6 billion last year, has increasingly moved online in recent years, as vendors like McAfee and CA align themselves with Internet service providers to gain market share.,Selling software to consumers online is much more efficient than selling through retail stores. But analysts have criticized security vendors for distributing their software through Internet providers. As good as such deals are for gaining new customers, they yield far less revenue for each subscriber  â€” as little as $3 a customer, by some estimates  â€” compared with the $30 they can make by selling through a retailer.,Sana has no such concerns, because it has traditionally sold to businesses, not consumers. Sanaâ€™s revenue was under $20 million last year, according to Timothy Eades, its senior vice president for marketing, though last yearâ€™s sales were five times  in  2005.,Symantec, one of the biggest security software vendors, also distributes its software through Internet providers, but Erin Hintz, the vice president for  worldwide consumer marketing, said the company had been careful not to give its products away too cheaply.,â€œWeâ€™ve been pretty good about striking partnerships where itâ€™s beneficial for both parties, while some of our competitors havenâ€™t,â€ù Ms. Hintz said. Over all, though, consumers have â€œabsolutely shifted more and more online as their preferred buying channel,â€ù she said, as banks and other financial services companies joined Internet providers in selling security software to their customers.,Try as they may, such efforts will do little to attract the nearly one-third of consumers who, according to Forrester Research, are still leery of buying anything online.,â€œThatâ€™s why people will often purchase for the first time in a retail store,â€ù Ms. Hintz said. â€œThen when they renew their subscription, theyâ€™re more comfortable doing the transaction online.â€ù",BOB TEDESCHI,"JAN. 29, 2007",Harnessing the Web to Sell Online Security,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/technology/29ecom.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When a court-appointed special master last year rejected the claim of an Alabama couple that their daughter had suffered seizures after a vaccination, she explained her decision in part by referring to material from articles in Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia.,The reaction from the court above her, the United States Court of Federal Claims, was direct: the materials â€œculled from the Internet do not â€” at least on their face â€” meetâ€ù standards of reliability. The court reversed her decision.,Oddly, to cite the â€œpervasive, and for our purposes, disturbing series of disclaimersâ€ù concerning the siteâ€™s accuracy, the same Court of Federal Claims relied on an article called â€œResearching With Wikipediaâ€ù found â€” where else? â€” on  Wikipedia. (The family has reached a settlement, their lawyer said.),A simple search of published court decisions shows that Wikipedia is frequently cited by judges around the country, involving serious issues and the bizarre â€” such as a 2005 tax case before the Tennessee Court of Appeals concerning the definition of â€œbeverageâ€ù that involved hundreds of thousands of dollars, and, just this week, a case in Federal District Court in Florida that involved the term â€œbooty musicâ€ù as played during a wet T-shirt contest.,More than 100 judicial rulings have relied on Wikipedia, beginning in 2004, including 13 from circuit courts of appeal, one step below the Supreme Court. (The Supreme Court thus far has never cited Wikipedia.),â€œWikipedia is a terrific resource,â€ù said Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. â€œPartly because it so convenient, it often has been updated recently and is very accurate.â€ù But, he added: â€œIt wouldnâ€™t be right to use it in a critical issue. If the safety of a product is at issue, you wouldnâ€™t look it up in Wikipedia.â€ù,Judge Posner recently cited a Wikipedia article on Andrew Golota, whom he called the â€œworldâ€™s most colorful boxer,â€ù about a drug case involving the fighterâ€™s former trainer, a tangent with no connection to the issues before his court. He did so despite his own experience with Wikipedia, which included an erroneous mention of Ann Coulter, a conservative lightning rod, as being a former clerk of his.,â€œI have never met Ann Coulter,â€ù he said, but added that he was heartened that the friend who spotted the error could fix it then and there.,That friend was Cass R. Sunstein, currently a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. â€œI love Wikipedia, but I donâ€™t think it is yet time to cite it in judicial decisions,â€ù he said, adding that â€œit doesnâ€™t have quality controlâ€ù He said he feared that â€œif judges use Wikipedia you might introduce opportunistic editingâ€ù to create articles  that could influence the outcome of cases.,He added, however, that he could not fault  a use like Judge Posnerâ€™s, which â€œseems too innocuous for a basis of criticism.â€ù,Many citations by judges, often in footnotes, are like Judge Posnerâ€™s, beside the main judicial point, appear intended to show how hip and contemporary the judge is, reflecting Professor Sunsteinâ€™s suspicion, â€œthat law clerks are using Wikipedia a great deal.â€ù,The Supreme Court of Iowa cites Wikipedia to explain that â€œjungle juiceâ€ù is â€œthe name given to a mix of liquor that is usually served for the sole purpose of becoming intoxicated.â€ù In the Florida case, the court noted that booty  music has â€œa slightly higher dance tempo and occasional sexually explicit lyrical content.â€ù,As opposed to these tangential references, Wikipedia has also been used for more significant facts.,Such cases include a Brooklyn surrogate courtâ€™s definition of the Jewish marriage ceremony and the Iowa Court of Appealsâ€™ declaration that French is the official language of the Republic of Guinea. In 2004, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Georgia, referred to a Wikipedia entry of the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s threat levels in a ruling concerning magnetometer searches of antiwar protesters.,In a recent letter to The New York Law Journal, Kenneth H. Ryesky, a tax lawyer who teaches at Queens College and Yeshiva University, took exception to the practice, writing that â€œcitation of an inherently unstable source such as Wikipedia can undermine the foundation not only of the judicial opinion in which Wikipedia is cited, but of the future briefs and judicial opinions which in turn use that judicial opinion as authority.â€ù,Recognizing that concern, Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law School who frequently writes about technology, said that he favored a system that captures in time online sources like Wikipedia, so that a reader sees the same material that the writer saw.,He said he used , for the online citations in his amicus brief to the Supreme Court in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios v. Grokster Ltd., which â€œmakes the particular reference a stable reference, and something someone can evaluate.â€ù,Wikipedia is increasingly becoming the default reference for the curious. According to comScore Media Metrix, there were more than 38 million unique visitors to Wikipedia sites in December in the United States, making it the 13th most popular destination.,Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University Law School, saw this as crucial: â€œThe most critical fact is public acceptance, including the litigants,â€ù he said. â€œA judge should not use Wikipedia when the public is not prepared to accept it as authority.â€ù,For now, Professor Gillers said, Wikipedia is best used for â€œsoft factsâ€ù that are not central to the reasoning of a decision. All of which leads to the question, if a fact isnâ€™t central to a judgeâ€™s ruling, why include it?,â€œBecause you want your opinion to be readable,â€ù said Professor Gillers. â€œYou want to apply context. Judges will try to set the stage. There are background facts. You donâ€™t have to include them. They are not determinitive. But they help the reader appreciate the context.â€ù,He added, â€œThe higher the court the more you want to do it. Why do judges cite Shakespeare or Kafka?â€ù",NOAM COHEN,"JAN. 29, 2007","Courts Turn to Wikipedia, but Selectively",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/technology/29wikipedia.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BEYOND its fulfillment of a constitutional requirement, the presidentâ€™s annual State of the Union address has come to provide much pomp. Itâ€™s a prime-time gala where Washingtonâ€™s best and brightest gather for an evening in the media spotlight, and where the nation tunes in with varying degrees of interest, cynicism or boredom at the bloated spectacle of it all.,Oh, sure, thereâ€™s the actual speech itself. But generally speaking, the odds for climactic elements â€” for truly earth-moving, unexpected locutions â€” are so low as to be negligible.,Copies of the speech are customarily distributed to members of the news media ahead of time â€” on the condition, of course, that they not be published until after the president begins his delivery. But in the age of the Internet, even that handshake agreement between the press and president has broken down: Copies of the speech could be found at sites like the Drudge Report and , well before President Bush began his address shortly after 9 p.m. last Tuesday.,â€œWeâ€™ll start respecting White House embargoes when they start telling the truth,â€ù wrote the editors at Think Progress.,It is perhaps no surprise, then, that Web gremlins would chuckle as the cameras panned the chamber Oscar-style last week and alighted on what appeared to be Senator , of Arizona, a presumed candidate for the Republican nomination for president, in an unguarded moment of slumber.,It is, perhaps, also no surprise in the age of YouTube â€” where unscripted video clips have become political Molotov cocktails â€” that a â€œMcCain sleepingâ€ù snippet was uploaded to the Internet and was being discussed and linked in short order.,Whether the original intent was political sabotage or simple humor is  hard to say, but either way the clip went straight for Mr. McCainâ€™s Achillesâ€™ heel: his age.

By 2008, if elected, he would be the oldest president to move into the White House.,So a video of the elderly statesman appearing to doze during the presidentâ€™s speech â€” and particularly during a portion of the speech where terrorism was being discussed â€” seemed to put questions of his fitness for office in stark relief.,And in that sense, the video brouhaha â€” a short-lived and misguided brouhaha, considering that he wasnâ€™t sleeping after all â€” constitutes one of the first â€œmacaca momentsâ€ù of the 2008 campaign. It is also a sign that Mr. McCain â€” and every candidate who has, or will, throw a hat into the ring â€” will have a very, very long road ahead.,Now, for those who have been living under a rock, it was former Senator George Allen of Virginia who was caught on video last August referring to an opposition aide â€” who was of Indian descent â€” as â€œmacaca,â€ù a racial slur obscure to many Americans, but potent enough to have caused a media frenzy when the video hit the Internet. Mr. Allen was not re-elected.,Reasonable people can disagree on the extent to which that single incident was to blame for Mr. Allenâ€™s defeat, but there was no question in anyoneâ€™s mind that the YouTube culture â€” in which every public moment can be clipped, cropped and distributed instantly across the globe by anyone at any time â€” had changed the rules of the game. As with the broken embargo on the State of the Union speech, there is no longer the default expectation that exposure can be managed. All bets are off.,The theory of Mr. McCainâ€™s supposed nap got an early boost from Tucker Carlson of MSNBC, who was blogging the speech live at ,.,â€œIf youâ€™re McCain, who will be over 70 by 2008, youâ€™ll want to make doubly sure to demonstrate your alertness and vigor,â€ù Mr. Carlson wrote just after 10 p.m. Tuesday. â€œYou definitely wonâ€™t want to slump in your seat, out cold, when Bush starts talking about Iraq. And yet thatâ€™s exactly what McCain did tonight, napping on camera for 10 agonizing seconds.â€ù,On Wednesday morning, the Drudge Report carried the headline â€œMcCain Eyes Wide Shut During Bush Speech,â€ù along with a link to a â€œSleepy Senator John McCainâ€ù video clip that had been uploaded to YouTube (and is still available of this writing: ,). It shows Mr. McCain in a straight-on shot, sitting in the crowded chamber, chin to chest, with eyes that appear to be closed.,David All, who runs the David All Group, a Washington firm focusing on developing new-media strategies for Republican campaigns, theorized at his Web site, ,, that the original uploader â€” a user going by the sobriquet monzsca â€” was not likely a political operative himself, but rather someone who simply thought the clip was funny. Mr. All suggests, however, that others seeking to damage Mr. McCain saw an opportunity.,â€œThough the clip was not created by an opposing campaign, it was probably identified by at least one of those campaigns as a tool to swipe at McCain to help make the argument that McCain is â€˜too oldâ€™ to be president, and passed it along to Drudge,â€ù Mr. All wrote on Thursday, in a deconstruction of the â€œSleepy Johnâ€ù affair.,â€œWhether he meant to or not, the YouTube user created a video that went viral, amplified by a coveted Drudge link,â€ù he wrote, â€œand is now getting a lot of front page treatment on a popular Web community, YouTube.â€ù,From Drudge, the clip and the discussion bounced around the blog circuit (including the Screens blog here at The Times as well as my own Times blog, The Lede), as did a swell of countervailing evidence, which ultimately won the day: it seems that Mr. McCain was, like just about everyone else in attendance that night, simply glancing down at his copy of the speech and reading along.,Mr. All gives high praise to swift action by McCain operatives, who uploaded a separate YouTube video showing a perky Senator McCain applauding heartily during the speech (,). They also pointed bloggers to links of a video montage â€” prepared by the folks at The Hotlineâ€™s On Call blog â€” demonstrating that others who were gathered in the House chamber that night, while clearly reading something in their laps, also appeared to be napping if shot at some angles  (,).,It was good political gamesmanship, and the thrust and parry provide an object lesson in the power of Internet video, particularly in the political arena. A candidate, an elected official, even a journalist who remains ignorant of this weapon â€” how to handle it, how to know when it has been unleashed and from what direction â€” proceeds at a certain peril.,Of course, even oneâ€™s best efforts at damage control may go unappreciated.,Said one commenter at Mr. Allâ€™s site: â€œAsleep or not, McCain et al. forgot one of the maxims of modern politics: When cameras are in the room, keep your head up and smile.â€ù",TOM ZELLER Jr.,"JAN. 29, 2007","In Politics, the Camera Never Blinks (or Nods)",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/technology/29link.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the last few years, as newspaper Web sites have started to maintain blogs, there have been plenty of setbacks. A Washington Post blog was shut down last January after commenters flooded it with vitriol, and the author of a Los Angeles Times blog was caught commenting  on his own posts under a pseudonym.,But there is no sign that newspapers are turning back: just last Wednesday, The Washington Post announced that it would be adding three new blogs.,Numbers recently released by Nielsen/NetRatings, the Internet traffic measurement firm, suggest that such blogs are picking up readers. NetRatings said that traffic to newspaper blogs had more than tripled over the last year, reaching 3.8 million in December. (The total unique visitors to newspaper Web sites in December was 29.9 million.) Slightly more men than women read online newspapers, and that trend is more pronounced on newspaper blogs, 66 percent of whose readers are male.,â€œNews and information is generally a male-skewing appetite,â€ù said Carolyn Creekmore, senior director of media analytics for NetRatings, â€œand blogs are really getting a lot of the most engaged consumers.â€ù ALEX MINDLIN",ALEX MINDLIN,"JAN. 29, 2007","Blog Traffic Grows, and Itâ€™s Mostly Male",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/technology/29drill.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two young girls are best, best friends. They grow up, grow apart, then rediscover their friendship as adults. Oh, and one of them is ,.,This is the basis of Tamar Rogoffâ€™s â€œEdith & Jenny,â€ù a well-intentioned but thin duo for her daughter, Ariel Rogoff Flavin, and Ms. Danes, childhood friends who grew apart, and â€” well, you know the rest. And it is mostly Ms. Danesâ€™s compelling physical presence and fame that add some fillip to the biographical premise of the piece, presented at Performance Space 122.,Ms. Rogoff pads her choreographic meditations on girlish friendship with extracts from two films, made in 1989 by Jeff Mueller, and featuring, separately, Ms. Flavin and Ms. Danes at age 11. Their charactersâ€™ names are Edith (Ms. Danes) and Jenny (Ms. Flavin), both emotionally scarred by their dysfunctional families. As the adult Ms. Danes and Ms. Flavin walk hand in hand, rock gently back and forth across each otherâ€™s bodies and watch their old films while cuddling on a chair, the suggestion seems to be that, as adults, they can offer each other the kind of comfort that will redress the isolation and pain of their past.,â€œEdith & Jennyâ€ù is handsomely presented, with a triptych of screens (the set design is by Michael Casselli)  on which the films and shifting images are projected. This forms the backdrop to the dance, as does an unobtrusive electronic score by Cebello Morales, punctuated by snatches from â€œA Chorus Lineâ€ù and Janacekâ€™s String Quartet No. 2. But its themes feel theoretical and rather vague, and the simple movements given to the women donâ€™t confer any personality or resonance on their characters. (And yes, Ms. Danes can dance, as she proved in her well-received collaboration in 2005 with Ms. Rogoff: â€œChristina Olson: American Model.â€ù),Ms. Rogoff seems oddly reticent about using Ms. Danesâ€™s dramatic abilities. At one moment, when the women re-enact a scene from one film, we do get a flash of that possibility. And the ambiguous eroticism of the friendship remains oddly flat, although on Saturday night Ms. Danesâ€™s performance did hint at a suppressed emotional maelstrom.,Such hints are smoothed over by the coy, happy-ever-after ending, with the women creating the illusion of a single body before the credits roll on screen. Female friendship is  a fine thing â€” but we knew that.",ROSLYN SULCAS,"JAN. 29, 2007","Girlsâ€™ Friendship, Renewed Choreographically",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/arts/dance/29rogo.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has been said that there would have been no , without Lincoln Kirstein. On Saturday night the company presented â€œTribute to Kirstein,â€ù a prelude of sorts to its season-long homage in the spring, on the centenary of his birth.,The programâ€™s three ballets â€” â€œEpisodes,â€ù â€œTributeâ€ù and â€œVienna Waltzesâ€ù â€”  didnâ€™t have any special connection to Kirstein. It was business as usual, as was the Saturday matinee, which included the seasonâ€™s first performance of ,â€™s â€œCarousel (A Dance)â€ù and role debuts in ,â€™s â€œIâ€™m Old Fashioned.â€ù But the extraordinary range of the repertory and outpourings of fresh young talent spoke to Kirsteinâ€™s achievement.,A man of imposing stature and intellectual brilliance, Kirstein, who died in 1996, coaxed , to the United States in 1933.  Though autocratic and self-doubting, Kirstein was a knowledgeable advocate and patron of American art, writing, photography and architecture as well as classical ballet. Many of his visions for an American ballet were unwieldy and impractical. But he and Balanchine made the improbable happen, Kirstein said, â€œby behaving as if it would happen.â€ù,One of Kirsteinâ€™s most beloved projects was the company-affiliated ,, which he directed from its inception until 1989. Christopher dâ€™Amboiseâ€™s â€œTribute,â€ù created for the school workshop performances in 2005, pays slightly academic homage to that love and to the traditions of classical ballet. Set to Bach, conducted by FayÃ§al Karoui with Susan Walters as piano soloist, the piece unfolds in eight flowing sections that give City Balletâ€™s youngest dancers many chances to shine.,Kirsteinâ€™s spirit hovered over the proceedings. The balletâ€™s lyrical opening solo, performed with luminous authority by Devin Alberda, would probably have delighted Kirstein, who followed the development of the schoolâ€™s gifted male students with special interest. The nibbling bourrÃ©es of the Allegro that followed, performed by Tiler Peck, Robert Fairchild and eight female corps dancers, recalled Kirsteinâ€™s habitual reference to the students as mice. Ms. Peckâ€™s attack, like a colt let out at last from the starting gate, suggested the potential for physical daring and openness that Balanchine saw in American dancers. Quotations from Balanchine classics are embedded in the rest of the ballet,  whose principals included Ashley Bouder, Tyler Angle, Megan LeCrone, Gretchen Smith and Adrian Danchig-Waring.,The two worlds created by Balanchine in â€œEpisodesâ€ù and â€œVienna Waltzes,â€ù repertory standards that opened and closed the evening program, could not be more different. The atmosphere is serene yet spare in â€œEpisodes,â€ù whose performers included Ask la Cour in a quietly authoritative role debut dancing with Teresa Reichlen in the Five Pieces pas de deux. The presence of Albert Evans, the black principal partnering Wendy Whelan in the Concerto pas de deux, recalls Kirsteinâ€™s championing of black dancers.,Kirstein also saw the point of spectacle. And Balanchineâ€™s 1977 â€œVienna Waltzesâ€ù shows off how far the company had come in terms of sumptuous resources, with its wondrously imaginative set designs by Rouben Ter-Arutunian and luscious dancing. Kyra Nichols was haunting in the closing waltz, performed with Philip Neal. Sterling Hyltin was an amusing scamp in a well-danced role debut, partnering Adam Hendrickson, in the Explosions Polka, with Miranda Weese and Benjamin Millepied pulling out the stops in the FrÃ_hlingsstimmen waltz.,In the afternoon program, Mr. Wheeldon avoided references to the dark narrative of the musical â€œCarousel,â€ù choosing instead to spool out dancing to match the scoreâ€™s hum-along sweep. Ms. Peck made a strongly danced, appropriately demure role debut, with Damian Woetzel as a nicely cocky partner. Sara Mearns created a full character in a well-danced, expressive role debut as the woman in blue in â€œIâ€™m Old Fashioned.â€ù Ellen Bar swept through a less central role as a new woman in yellow.",JENNIFER DUNNING,"JAN. 29, 2007","Kirstein, Youth and All Those Mice Who Made Good",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/arts/dance/29caro.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 28 â€” Here in the Swiss mountains at the ,, the annual conclave of world leaders, concerns over a growing digital divide this year have taken a back seat to the challenge of ,.,Being out of the limelight, however, has not dimmed passions over what  the best way is to deploy computers in the developing world. The controversy boiled over on Saturday at a breakfast meeting here where Craig R. Barrett, the chairman of Intel, squared off with Nicholas P. Negroponte, the former director of the M.I.T. Media Laboratory, whose nonprofit organization One Laptop Per Child is trying to develop a low-cost computer for the 1.2 billion children in the developing world. His prototype XO computer is designed to sell for $100 by the end of 2008.,Intel has also contributed significant resources to the cause, including its own design for an inexpensive laptop computer, albeit one that is currently more expensive than Mr. Negroponteâ€™s.,On Saturday, Mr. Barrett, speaking about Intelâ€™s efforts to train teachers to use personal computers, said that it is impressive to see what students â€œare able to accomplish with some help from a teacher,â€ù adding, â€œYou can literally change peopleâ€™s lives.â€ù,But Mr. Negroponte suggested that Intel executives had engaged in a campaign to discourage world leaders from committing to purchasing his laptop systems. Mr. Negroponte also accused Intel of marketing its strategy to the developing world.,â€œCraig and I sometimes argue, and he called our thing a â€˜gadget,â€™ â€ù Mr. Negroponte  said, referring to the XO. â€œIâ€™m glad to see heâ€™s got his own gadget now. Craig has to look at this as a market, and I look at this as a mission.â€ù,Other executives suggested the dispute was doing little to forge a common strategy to use computing to advance economic and educational development.,â€œI do hear marketing going back and forth between you,â€ù said Michael J. Long, a senior vice president at Arrow Electronics, an industry components supplier. â€œWe ought to concentrate on how we can help. The question is what can I do when I leave this room.â€ù,The dispute between Mr. Negroponte and Mr. Barrett, who was formerly Intelâ€™s chief executive and who is now chairman of the United Nations Global Alliance for Information and Communications Technologies and  Development, covered both substance and philosophy at the annual digital divide meeting, which has been presented for  three years by  David Kirkpatrick, a columnist for Fortune magazine.,Also present at the meeting was Michael S. Dell, chairman of Dell Inc.,  as well as top executives from Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices.,Mr. Negroponte, who has quarreled publicly with both Microsoft and Intel executives in his quest to give simple portable machines to hundreds of millions of children, has long been known for his iconoclastic positions on economic development and education.,Recently at the Digital, Life, Design conference  in Munich, he introduced himself as the â€œgood bin Ladenâ€ù â€” a reference to the notion that his low-cost laptop is terrorizing some companies in the computer industry because of the possibility that it will transform markets for personal computers in the developing world.,At the Davos session, Mr. Barrett sketched out a four-point program for getting involvement from emerging economies including affordable hardware, low-cost data communications, local curriculum and educators.,In contrast, Mr. Negroponte offered a vision based on working through  children. He attacked projects that instruct teachers and students how to use programs like Microsoft Office.,â€œI think they should be making music and playing and communicating,â€ù he said. â€œIt has to be a seamless part of their lives.â€ù,Despite initially trying to persuade Intel to back his project, Mr. Negroponte has chosen to use a low-power processor from Advanced Micro in his laptop, which was being exhibited here at a hotel near the conference center where the annual World Economic Forum is held.,It is still not certain whether Mr. Negroponte will succeed in his crusade. At the meeting, he said he now has eight handshake agreements with heads of state, including the recent additions of  Rwanda and Uruguay.,However, he has also said that he will not begin  manufacturing  the laptop in volume unless he has firm commitments from one country each in Asia, South America and Africa. Other countries that have expressed interest include Brazil, Argentina, Libya, Nigeria, Thailand, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Mexico.,During an interview here, he said  he now expects firm commitments  by  March and for manufacturing to begin in April.,Despite his publicly combative stance with respect to Intel, Mr. Negroponte has apparently moved to patch up his disagreements with Microsoft, and a version of Windows may be available from governments that chose that software instead of the Linux that the One Laptop Per Child organization is developing.,One Laptop officials said that the computer might cost $10 to $20 more to run Windows, because of  hardware support.,Separately at the meeting on Saturday, John Gage, the chief researcher at Sun Microsystems, proposed an industry plan to deploy advanced data networks in developing economies with contributions of engineering staff time of 1 percent.,Mr. Gage, who headed the NetDay project for connecting American  schools to the Internet, said that rural areas in the developing world would cost as little as a $1,000 a kilometer, compared with $1 million to deploy a network over the same distance in New York City.",JOHN MARKOFF,"JAN. 29, 2007","At Davos, the Squabble Resumes on How to Wire the Third World",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/business/worldbusiness/29cheap.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28 â€” After five years of job losses, Silicon Valley is hiring again. The turnaround coincides with a huge increase of investment in the emerging category of clean environment technology.,â€œWeâ€™re looking at a tremendous market opportunity,â€ù said David Pearce, founder and chief executive of Mirasole, a manufacturer of solar cell technology in Santa Clara, Calif. â€œSupply is the only constraint.â€ù,Mr. Pearce founded the company in 2001, but it was not until the middle of 2006 that Mirasole embarked on an ambitious plan to grow from 25 people a year ago, to at least 300 employees by the end of 2007. Today, Mirasole has 95 employees, most of them engineers and scientists.,Mr. Pearceâ€™s company may serve as a harbinger  in this region. For Mirasole, which in October closed a $35 million round of venture financing, the time is finally right for quantity sales of the solar cell product it has spent the last few years designing.,In Silicon Valley, investment in clean technology â€” from alternative energy products, like solar panels and hybrid cars, to the use of nanotechnology to solve environmental problems â€” went from $34 million in the first quarter of 2006 to $290 million in the third quarter, according to an annual report released Sunday by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a research organization in San Jose, Calif.,â€œItâ€™s the hottest area of investment right now,â€ù said Tom Werner, chief executive of SunPower, a solar technology company.,Russell Hancock, chief executive of Joint Venture, said the emerging need for clean technology is a good fit with the skills and companies already in the area. â€œA new cluster is emerging in Silicon Valley that provides leadership around global ,,â€ù Mr. Hancock said.,Clean technology crosses many industries, with nearly a quarter of the venture capital in clean technology going to software companies, followed by 15 percent going to semiconductor companies. While it is unclear precisely how many jobs were added in the field, the increase is substantial.,But Silicon Valleyâ€™s job gains are not limited to clean technology. Overall nonfarm employment in Silicon Valley, a region sprawling across 1,500 square miles over four counties,  grew by more than 33,000 from the second quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2006, an increase of nearly 3 percent. Overall venture capital investment in Silicon Valley was $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $4.6 billion in the same period in 2005.,While the job growth is still far from what the area enjoyed during the boom years of the late 1990s, it is a major reversal. After the dot-com bubble burst six years ago, thousands of engineers and technology workers were unemployed, with suddenly little demand for their skills. In 2002 alone, Silicon Valley lost more than 10 percent of its jobs. During the downturn, it had a net loss of 220,000 jobs.,Stephen Levy, an economist with the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, said the growing demand for clean technologies might well make this emerging boom cycle a lasting trend. Developments on the legislative front may help stimulate that growth. In September, California lawmakers set a goal of cutting the stateâ€™s greenhouse emissions  25 percent by 2020.,â€œEvery time thereâ€™s a new technology, Silicon Valley does pretty well,â€ù he said. â€œThatâ€™s beginning to happen again.â€ù,The region first started to show a reversal in late 2005, Mr. Levy said, a trend he attributed to an increase in worldwide demand for technology products. â€œSilicon Valley sells more to international markets than any other region, so we can grow as the international market grows, even if the U.S. market isnâ€™t growing,â€ù he said.,These days, signs of a recovery in Silicon Valley are widespread. Office vacancy rates are declining, while road traffic, an unofficial barometer of employment in California, is noticeably increasing.,Median household income in Santa Clara County, the largest county of Silicon Valley, was up in 2005 for the first time since the downturn. It reached $76,300 in 2005, the most recent year for which figures are available, compared with $72,000 in 2004, the lowest point since the downturn.,Mr. Hancock points out that Silicon Valley has been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles for decades. Industries based on military contracting, personal computing and electronic commerce have thrived and then were followed by a period of contraction. Now, almost everyone agrees that Silicon Valley is coming back again.,â€œThese waves are nothing new,â€ù Mr. Hancock said. â€œBut the last one was full of hype and excess, and we had to go through a powerful period of readjustment. This time the investing feels more sober and well thought out.â€ù,Besides clean technology, the region is seeing an increase of jobs in the creative sector, a trend that Mr. Hancock attributes to the growing needs of new-media companies. Much of the job growth is in small companies. More Silicon Valley companies have offices overseas, the study says, and there has been a sharp rise in the joint patents with foreign companies.,Despite the surge in jobs, Silicon Valley faces considerable challenges. According to the report, the percentage of first-time home buyers who can afford a median-priced home declined to 26 percent, from 31 percent in 2005. The high school graduation rate is down, while the crime rate is up.,â€œWe face all the same challenge we did before,â€ù Mr. Levy said. â€œWe can add jobs, but we still have a lot to do to make this a place where people want to live.â€ù",LAURIE J.

"The standing ovation came before a note of music had been sung. The Marilyn Horne Foundationâ€™s annual gala recital is supposed to focus on song, but it also focuses on Marilyn Horne. Looking radiant in gold lace, apparently undaunted by a yearâ€™s struggle with cancer, she played host to Friday eveningâ€™s event at Zankel Hall, a night after giving a master class there, with every bit of her star flair. And at her first entrance the audience stood, with applause and shouts of â€œBrava,â€ù to greet her.,Strange to say, the main attractions of the Horne Foundationâ€™s four-day event (now in its 13th year), of which the gala was the culmination, do the least singing. This year master classes led by Ms. Horne, Barbara Cook and Evelyn Lear rather overshadowed two duo recitals by young singers.,Customarily the gala also features a guest artist in a cameo star turn. This year it was Marcello Giordani, who offered three Italian songs that had little to do with the programâ€™s title, â€œGypsy in My Soul.â€ù For a man acknowledged as one of todayâ€™s leading tenors, three songs are a walk in the park, and Mr. Giordani tossed them off, with plenty of high notes. One is often aware, listening to him, of his hectic schedule; he seems to be in too much of a hurry to caress any one note fully, though you, and he, know that he could if he wanted to.,The bulk of the program was left to four able beneficiaries of the foundation: Leonardo Capalbo, a tenor; Sasha Cooke, a mezzo; Erica Strauss, a soprano; and Andrew Garland, a baritone. The tricky thing about these recitals is that they spotlight young artists performing music that may be new to them. Certainly Mr. Capalbo, who has a nice baritonal heft, didnâ€™t sound completely at home in â€œTres Poemasâ€ù by JoaquÃ_n Turina: he sang strongly but also often flat. Ms. Cooke, who has a smooth, grounded mezzo, and Ms. Strauss, who seems a little overeager to establish the strength of a good-size voice that needed a little more filling out, alternated in Dvorakâ€™s â€œCiganske Melodieâ€ù (â€œGypsy Songsâ€ù).,The sandy-voiced Mr. Garland got to deliver the eveningâ€™s world premiere: two of three songs by Gabriela Lena Frank, settings of the Nicaraguan poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra. (The third song was composed during the workshop for composers and singers led by John Harbison andDawn Upshaw at Carnegie in 2004.) The three songs were effective though a little similar in their dramaturgy: in each, a thick piano part welled around the voice, then pulled back to leave him singing softly, a capella, or even speaking at climactic moments, after which the piano commented with plucked chords like the strumming of a guitar. Donna Loewy was the competent accompanist.,The other accompanists were Jonathan Kelly; the sparkling Vlad Iftinca; Jerome Tan; and a star in his field, Warren Jones. After the four singers had concluded the evening with a batch of rather messy Brahms â€œZigeunerliederâ€ù quartets, Mr. Jones buoyed them in a rendition of â€œEverythingâ€™s Coming Up Rosesâ€ù that was happily puppylike in its enthusiasm.",ANNE MIDGETTE,"JAN. 29, 2007",Marilyn Horne Puts Her ProtÃ©gÃ©s on Parade in Song,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/arts/music/29song.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, was linked to the search â€œwaffles,â€ù while other Google bombs have been elaborate jokes or personal vendettas.,Writing on the Google blog, Matt Cutts, the head of the Googleâ€™s Webspam team,  said that Google bombs had not â€œbeen a very high priority for us.â€ù But he added: â€œOver time, weâ€™ve seen more people assume that they are Googleâ€™s opinion, or that Google has hand-coded  the results for these Google-bombed queries. Thatâ€™s not true, and it seemed like it was worth trying to correct that misperception.â€ù,Mr. Cutts was not available on Friday to expand on his blog, a Google spokeswoman said. A White House spokesman had no comment on the issue.,Despite the changes by Google, some other Google bombs are still operative. A search for â€œFrench military victoriesâ€ù still produces a first result that says, â€œYour search  â€”  French military victories  â€”  did not match any documents.â€ù Click there and your find a mockup of a Google search page asking the question â€œDid you mean: French military defeats.â€ù,The organizer of the â€œmiserable failureâ€ù Google bomb was George Johnston, a political activist and software programmer in Bellevue, Wash.,What began as a prank become something more after Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Johnston said. In September 2005, he said he noticed a renewed interest in the â€œmiserable failureâ€ù prank; he believes â€œpeople were in shock over New Orleansâ€ù and began typing â€œfailureâ€ù into their searches. Mr. Johnston said he considered Googleâ€™s decision politically motivated, even if was not done by hand, and noted that the company had agreed to censor results in China. â€œI believe them that they tweaked the algorithm, but it is such weasel words,â€ù he said. â€œThe fact that some Google bombs still work makes me think they have a blacklist essentially of ways of tweaking results.â€ù,He hasnâ€™t given up the fight, he said, and remains unhappy with Googleâ€™s tweak. â€œThey say they fixed it. I think they broke it,â€ù he said.

"Part of the news mediaâ€™s job is to make information from people in high places more accessible to the masses. Now one newspaper has decided to restrict access to its own content, and it hopes to make some money by doing so.,The Sacramento Bee, which is owned by the McClatchy Company, announced on Wednesday that it was introducing a new Web site focused on California government and state politics. Membership to The Beeâ€™s Capitol Alert costs $499 a year, although lower rates are available for offices or organizations that buy several memberships at once.,In addition to the extra content that is now a fixture of paid-registration newspaper Web sites (exclusive blogs, expanded columns, e-mail updates), Capitol Alert will also allow subscribers to enjoy early access to some articles scheduled to appear in the next dayâ€™s paper. Most of the paperâ€™s articles are currently uploaded to the Beeâ€™s Web site around midnight; Capitol Alert will have articles and editorials focusing on politics available at 8 p.m. the night before.,Many newspapers, including The New York Times, have placed at least some of their content behind paid-registration walls, in attempts to generate more online revenue as print subscribers decline.  (Registration to The Beeâ€™s main Web site, ,, will remain free.),According to Joyce Terhaar, The Beeâ€™s managing editor, the Capitol Alert content is intended for a niche audience, such as lobbyists or political insiders. She added that breaking news would still be posted on the paperâ€™s main Web site during the day.,â€œWeâ€™re looking at three different publishing platforms and making news judgments,â€ù Ms. Terhaar said, adding that Capitol Alert will provide content that would not be â€œof broad interestâ€ù to the main Web siteâ€™s readers or that would not necessarily make it into the paper. â€œWeâ€™re also practicing, so we could kind of figure out through the course of the day whatâ€™s nicheâ€ù and what should go into the paper.,Ms. Terhaar said that the paper has not yet received any complaints or criticism about the early access to the articles. And Kelly McBride, the ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute, a journalism organization, said that she did not see any ethical problem with The Beeâ€™s venture.,â€œEssentially what theyâ€™re doing is giving people an added bonus rather than penalizing the public,â€ù she said, comparing The Beeâ€™s two levels of news access to the difference between first class and coach seats on airplanes. â€œIâ€™m not going to be critical of them, because weâ€™re in a point in time where newspapers will have to be creative and innovative with how theyâ€™re going to use their online content to generate revenue.â€ù MARIA ASPAN",MARIA ASPAN,"JAN. 29, 2007",One Paper Hopes Fans of Politics Will Pay Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/business/media/29bee.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It seems strange, so many decades after the postwar avant-garde first gathered in Darmstadt,  Germany, how often the words unabashedly and tonal are still linked. Given that composers now enthusiastically write in wildly diverse idioms, calling a piece â€œunabashedly tonalâ€ù seems almost as odd as referring to a work as â€œbashfully dissonant.â€ù,The recent orchestral works of the popular Philadelphia composer Jennifer Higdon are certainly primarily tonal, as well as imaginative, richly orchestrated and accessible, which presumably  explains why â€œBlue Cathedralâ€ù is one of the most frequently performed new works in the United States. The Oberlin Conservatory Symphony Orchestra gave a dynamic reading of the piece during its concert on Friday night at ,, led by  ,.,Mr. Spano, the enthusiastic music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, is a 1983 Oberlin Conservatory graduate and now associate professor of conducting there. He has championed Ms. Higdonâ€™s works (in performance and on recordings) and transmitted his excitement to the young musicians. They played â€œBlue Cathedralâ€ù (written in 1999 during the first anniversary of the death of the composerâ€™s brother) with skill and understanding, vividly illuminating the Coplandesque swaths of color that build to an intense, optimistic climax.,A performance of Mozartâ€™s Piano Concerto No. 25 in C (K. 503), which followed on the program, was more tentative. The workâ€™s architecture wasnâ€™t quite coherent, and textures were muddy, although the soloist, the pianist Pedja Muzijevic (not an Oberlin graduate), gave a competent, tastefully ornamented rendition. He ably played an unusually elaborate cadenza by Philipp Karl Hoffmann, Mozartâ€™s contemporary.,But the uncertainty the musicians seemed to feel during the Mozart disappeared during a stellar performance of Bartokâ€™s Concerto for Orchestra, which concluded the concert. The contrasting moods of the five movements were probingly explored, and there was no weak link in the band. The fiery, polished strings and excellent woodwinds and brass all confidently enjoyed their chance to shine in Bartokâ€™s egalitarian concerto.,Before the concert Oberlinâ€™s dean, David H. Stull, pointed out that New York is the primary destination for Oberlin graduates.

"Tonight a show about disappointment begins just right.,â€œBoulevard of Broken Dreams,â€ù the latest schadenfreude jamboree, fails to live up to the simplest expectation that it  feature â€œBoulevard of Broken Dreams,â€ù the appropriate Green Day anthem of self-pity, as a theme song. Would E! Entertainment Television  not spring for the rights? In any case the show, which had its debut last week, starts with stupid chords instead.  Whatever. Itâ€™s too bad.,E!â€™s â€œBoulevard of Broken Dreamsâ€ù is the MySpacerâ€™s apparent answer to VH1â€™s grand old warhorse, â€œBehind the Music,â€ù which used to offer parables of musical careers gone wrong. â€œBoulevard,â€ù however, seems to be cultivating amnesia about its esteemed predecessor, even as it revisits the same cautionary tales that VH1 exploited first and better.,Consider E!â€™s perfunctory gloss of Leif Garrettâ€™s surrender of his teenage fame to heroin addiction, for example. He entered rehab a year ago, and according to those interviewed in the segment,  only his mother seems to believe heâ€™ll recover this time. This tepid rehash made me crave another look at VH1â€™s pioneering 1999 episode on that fallen star.,Back then Mr. Garrettâ€™s stagey reunion with Roland Winkler, an estranged friend he left paralyzed after driving on Quaaludes in 1979, tore at the heart. Mr. Winkler seemed at peace; Mr. Garrett, who was professing sobriety for the cameras but would go on to more drug-related arrests, seemed tormented. Mr. Winkler does not appear on E!â€™s show, nor do any of the affecting VH1 interviews.,Too bad, again, that E! hasnâ€™t more closely studied the â€œBehind the Musicâ€ù playbook. It fails to take a respectful tone, make use of cultural history or (so far) arrange reunions.,Come to think of it, what an achievement that old series was. You knew at the top of any â€œBTMâ€ù that after gold records, gardening accidents and Angel Dust canâ€™t be far behind, and the pattern of rise and fall became almost comforting,  proof that at least you were right not to have gone into rock â€™nâ€™ roll instead of tax law or journalism.,At its best the VH1 series was able to connect pain, music and history in meaningful ways. It came to serve as an odd form of cultural redemption â€” for the â€™60s and â€™70s in particular â€” as well as the birthplace of the nostalgia for musical oddities that still determines a percentage of iTunes downloads.,â€œBoulevard of Broken Dreamsâ€ù is unlikely to leave such a legacy. Where â€œBehind the Music,â€ù because it appeared on Viacomâ€™s VH1, had access to music and music videos, â€œBoulevard of Broken Dreamsâ€ù has to content itself with crumbs from the tables of stars desperate to get airtime. And where â€œBTM,â€ù as a brand-new concept,  operated without the collaboration of the principal figures in its episodes â€” and thus told stories using history and archival material â€” â€œBoulevardâ€ù is determined to get as much access as possible, and thus ends up telling the stories of comebacks as much as downfalls.,On tonightâ€™s  episode, for instance, the cast-off members of Destinyâ€™s Child â€” LeToya Luckett, Farrah Franklin and LaTavia Roberson  â€” complain about their ill treatment by Matthew Knowles, BeyoncÃ©â€™s father. But they donâ€™t dwell nearly enough on old resentments. Before you know it, theyâ€™re plugging their new projects as if they were cruising down the Highway of Happy Hopes.,Ms. Luckett is even talking about her solo album, which was No. 1 on the Billboard 200 less than six months ago. By the end itâ€™s hard to see this lively, bright-smiling young superstar ever for a minute trudging along what Green Day calls â€œthis empty street ... where the city sleeps ... Iâ€™m the only one and I walk alone.â€ù,Similarly, in the first episode, Niki Taylor,  the fashion model whose sister, Krissy, died  and who herself suffered injuries  in a  car accident, was stalwart about her return to modeling and now boutique-operating. (Ms. Luckett also owns a boutique.) Ms. Taylor appears fully recovered from the accident, which, weâ€™re told, caused some internal problems.  Neither Ms. Luckett nor Ms. Taylor could quite deliver this show. For starters, neither  seemed like a match for  Leif Garrett, whose life  seems tailor-made for this boulevard.

"In the old days, presidential races were one-year events. John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy on Jan. 2, 1960, and was elected that November. Earlier this month, would-be candidates who were still deciding whether to run in 2008 were being accused of reckless delay. Presidential campaign pundits were saying that if Senator Hillary Clinton had waited another minute to announce,  Senator Barack Obama would have locked up every New Hampshire county committee member and hedge fund billionaire.,This really is an election on hyperspeed.,Part of this is due to the peculiarities of the race. President Bush is so unpopular that a power vacuum is opening up in Washington and, for the first time in many election cycles, both partiesâ€™ nominations are wide open. The Internet is also fueling the overdrive, with â€œnetroots primaries,â€ù in which the voting has already begun.,The biggest factors, though, are money and an ever-compressed schedule. California, Illinois, Florida and New Jersey are all maneuvering to move up their primaries to next February. That has candidates rushing to lock up the big donors â€” and bypassing the public finance system. Senator Clinton has already made clear that she will be opting out for both the primary and the general election. Senator John McCain, a major supporter of campaign finance reform who is no longer sponsoring a big reform bill that  once bore his name, seems likely to do the same, with many candidates to follow. The problem with the 23-month campaign is not just the fatigue it will inspire, but the effect on democracy. Bundlers â€” master fund-raisers who package individual contributions into big ones â€” will have even more power. There is no way to stop candidates from hurling their hats into the ring so early. But there are things that can, and should, be done.,The national parties should stop the statesâ€™ mad race to have first-in-the-nation primaries. They should adopt a schedule that reformers have been proposing for years: regional primaries that rotate, so that voters in every state eventually have a turn to be among the first to vote. Congress should fix the broken public financing system, which has not been significantly updated since it was adopted in 1974. Spending limits need to be raised, to keep pace with ever-rising costs. More money needs to be put in the fund, and there should be more flexibility to help candidates who accept public financing compete against big-money candidates who opt out.,If Hillary vs. Obama vs. Rudy vs. McCain is already starting to feel old, remember that there are more than 600  days to go. We will never return to the time when presidential campaigns unfolded handshake by handshake in New Hampshire â€” and we shouldnâ€™t â€” but Congress and the national parties can set a more thoughtful 21st-century pace.",,"JAN. 29, 2007",23-Month Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/opinion/29mon1.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"DAVENPORT, ,, Jan. 28 â€” Senator , was in a Cedar Rapids living room crammed with Iowa voters on Saturday night when a voice from the back asked why the Clintons were such polarizing figures in American politics. The room grew still, except for the crackle of the fireplace.,â€œI could give you a flip answer that, you know, some people are going to like me, and some people are not,â€ù Mrs. Clinton said, smiling and sipping from a cup of water. â€œBut I think itâ€™s bigger and deeper than that.â€ù,For the next few minutes, Mrs. Clinton spoke about why she thought she incited such strong emotions â€” because she was part of an unconventional, high-profile couple, â€œstanding my groundâ€ù on controversial issues â€” and how she could overcome them in a presidential race.,â€œI was part of a political couple that was very much committed to progressive political policies,â€ù she said. â€œIn a perverse form of flattery, people who opposed us took us seriously and decided that it was important to go after us, and I understand that and I accept that.â€ù,The last time Mrs. Clinton was on a journey like this, as a Democratic candidate for the Senate on a â€œlistening tourâ€ù in New York in 1999, she almost certainly would have resorted to a flip answer, a nervous joke or a cautious evasion.,But by the time she was done with her inaugural two-day trip as a presidential hopeful on Sunday evening, it was clear that the candidate who trudged across New York almost seven years ago did not show up in Iowa this weekend.,This candidate Clinton did a lot more talking than listening. She offered an assertive case against the Bush administration and for her own qualifications to be president. She discussed easily the intricacies of American policy in Israel and in Iran, and, less easily, in Iraq, as she called on President Bush to â€œextricate our countryâ€ù from Iraq by the time he leaves office in 2009.,She dealt, with self-deprecatory answers and at some length, with questions she used to avoid with a nervous shrug. Again and again, without a whisper of the hesitancy she showed when she began her 2000 campaign, Mrs. Clinton embraced her status as a woman seeking a high office, with all its attendant benefits and risks.,Some of her answers could arguably be described as self-serving, including the one in Cedar Rapids on Saturday night about her place in American politics. She still skipped away from the specifics on tough issues. While she called for universal health coverage far more forcefully this weekend than she did in 2000 â€” â€œI am committed to universal health care,â€ù she said Saturday to roars of approval in Des Moines â€” she said she was not prepared to lay out what form that should take.,At a news conference on Sunday afternoon, she repeatedly dodged a query about whom she had had in mind, at a town hall meeting earlier in the day, when she slowly and theatrically repeated back a question â€” â€œWhat, in my background, equips me to deal with evil and bad men?â€ù â€” with a conspiratorial smile. The question referred to foreign leaders; the audience, which responded with a roar of laughter, clearly thought Mrs. Clinton had been thinking of tormentors on the domestic front.,To a certain extent, the change in Mrs. Clinton on display this weekend reflected an adaptation to a far different political challenge in Iowa than she faced in New York. But it was also evidence of her evolution as a candidate, displaying what two campaigns and six years in the Senate have done for her political skills. It showed how she was responding to an intensely competitive field and to persistent doubts about her initial support for the war in Iraq and her electability.,From the start, Mrs. Clinton said she would approach her campaign in Iowa, the state that is supposed to have the first nominating contest for the 2008 race, as she did her 2000 Senate campaign in New York: methodically and exhaustively, with intimate chats where she would listen to voter concerns and permit Iowans to get to know her.,â€œThis is what I like to do best; itâ€™s what I did in New York when I started running,â€ù Mrs. Clinton said.,But for all her effort to restage the 2000 campaign here â€” â€œLet the conversation begin!â€ù read the banner at her town hall meeting â€” this is a very different year and a very different campaign.,The central goal of the New York listening tour was to address accusations that Mrs. Clinton, a native of Chicago, was a carpetbagger. Iowans, however, expect their presidential candidates to represent different parts of the nationâ€™s geography and culture.,And after this weekend, it seemed fair to say that a dutiful schedule of stops at churches and diners, which worked when Mrs. Clinton had a full year to devote to such visits in New York, would not work here.,An estimated 1,000 people turned out to see her at the town hall event on Sunday morning, prompting organizers to move it from a restaurant to an exhibit hall at the state fairgrounds. Mrs. Clinton spent an hour taking questions and lingered for nearly another hour talking to anyone who could push through the crowd. An intimate chat it was not.,Even more striking was the shift in Mrs. Clinton. In 1999, the listening tour was aptly named: Mrs. Clinton would go for hours saying barely a word, just nodding and asking questions. Her aides, concerned that she was viewed as too polarizing, were delighted at any day that passed without her saying anything that made big news; it was a campaign that succeeded because it was bland.,But in Iowa, over the course of two days, Mrs. Clinton attacked the Bush administration for policies that she said favored the rich, for destroying what she said was a balanced world and financial order left by her husband, and for pursuing policies that she said encouraged ,.,â€œOur leadership in Washington, in particular from our president and vice president, has been undermining the progress our country made during the 20th century,â€ù she said in Cedar Rapids. â€œWhen I first got to the United States Senate, I realized this new administration wanted to undo everything my husband had done. And I admit, I take that rather personally.â€ù,Mrs. Clinton took issue with Mr. Bushâ€™s suggestion that the war in Iraq would spill into the administration of the next president.,â€œI think itâ€™s the height of irresponsibility, and I really resent it,â€ù she said. â€œThis was his decision to go to war, he went with an ill-conceived plan, an incompetently executed strategy, and we should expect him to extricate our country from this before he leaves office.â€ù,Whatever the confusion at the news conference over her remarks about â€œevil and bad men,â€ù her audience of voters â€” Iowans who had not flown in for the day â€” ate it up, breaking out in long laughter, a reaction Mrs. Clinton seldom saw in her Senate campaign, at least in the early days of the tour. As for her audience of reporters, Mrs. Clinton lifted an eyebrow and said no when someone asked if she had had another person named Clinton in mind.,â€œYou guys!â€ù she chuckled after the third question from a reporter on the topic. â€œI thought I was funny. You guys keep telling me, lighten up, be fun. Now I get a little funny, and Iâ€™m being psychoanalyzed.â€ù",ADAM NAGOURNEY,"JAN. 29, 2007","In Iowa, Candidate Clinton Takes a New Tack, and Talks",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/us/politics/29clinton.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 â€” Some women were struck by the politics of maternity practiced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in recent weeks, the imagery and stagecraft that highlighted their roles as mothers and/or grandmothers.,For some, the issues were complicated: Is this a throwback, or a step forward? Is it politically smart?,For a long time women seeking high office, particularly executive office, were advised to play down their softer, domestic side, and play up their strength and qualifications. Focus groups often found voters questioning  whether women were strong enough, tough enough, to lead.,Emilyâ€™s List, the Democratic womenâ€™s group, warned in an internal memo in 1988 that women must â€œfight throughout their campaigns to establish their qualifications, power, toughness and capacity to win.â€ù,Breakthrough candidates like Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who campaigned unsuccessfully for governor under the slogan â€œtough and caringâ€ù in 1990, worked hard to ease those doubts.,Some women embraced their outsider status. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, campaigned in 1992 as â€œjust a mom in tennis shoes,â€ù capitalizing on a dismissive comment once directed her way by a male politician. But the reservations of many voters were real 15 or 20 years ago.,Today, many political strategists say women no longer have to be so defensive. Voters have grown more accustomed to women in powerful positions. And women like Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton, whatever other problems they may have, have been on the public scene long enough and are familiar enough players in the architecture of power that they no longer have to prove their strength day in and day out.,In fact, strong leadership was seen as one of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s core attributes in a CBS News Poll, conducted Jan. 18-21. Sixty-four percent of the men surveyed, and 75 percent of the women,  said Mrs. Clinton had strong qualities of leadership.,â€œItâ€™s a whole different world,â€ù said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist and a longtime Feinstein adviser. And the stereotypes are weakening as younger generations come along, Mr. Carrick added.,What this means, strategists say,  is that motherhood and a focus on children can become one more political asset to be showcased  â€” a way of humanizing a candidate and connecting with voters, especially other women.,Ms. Pelosi took the speakerâ€™s gavel, ordinarily a moment of raw legislative power, in a carefully structured tableau filled with children, some of them her own grandchildren. Mrs. Clinton held the first event of her presidential campaign surrounded by children at a health care clinic, where she announced her support for expanded health coverage for children.,Aides to both women object to the idea that this is in any way contrived. Ms. Pelosi did, in fact, raise five children before she ran for office, and Mrs. Clinton raised one and has been an advocate on childrenâ€™s issues since her days in law school.,But candidates decide how to tell their story â€” George W. Bush highlighted his bipartisan friendships and alliances when he ran  in 2000 â€” and there are good political reasons for Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton to highlight the maternal.,For Ms. Pelosi, relentlessly caricatured by the Republicans last year as a hard-edged, tax-raising liberal, the image of mother and grandmother takes the edge off the ideological cartoon. As Karen Oâ€™Connor, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University, puts it, â€œFor Nancy Pelosi, it becomes, â€˜O.K., am I going to be the San Francisco liberal, or the woman who relates to all voting women, because Iâ€™ve raised five kids, I have several wonderful grandchildren and I can also run your House.â€™ â€ù,Kate Oâ€™Beirne, Washington editor of National Review and a conservative analyst, said she believed Ms. Pelosiâ€™s imagery â€œwas probably effective.â€ù (Although she quickly added, â€œI donâ€™t see that as a welcome development.â€ù) Ms. Oâ€™Beirne said that â€œthe opticsâ€ù of a speaker assuming power surrounded by children signaled â€œa kinder, gentler, softer approachâ€ù to voters, particularly women, who are weary of a long and difficult war and the intense partisanship in Washington in recent years.,â€œI definitely think thatâ€™s calculated,â€ù she said.,For Mrs. Clinton, highlighting the maternal is a way of building on what polls and strategists suggest are her clear advantages, like strength and intelligence, while compensating for what are widely considered her liabilities: a coolness, an excess of caution and a capacity to so polarize the electorate that many voters question her ability to win.,Several analysts said this softer approach also allowed Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton to offer a clear contrast with the leadership style of  President  Bush  , which Democrats have asserted was a  â€œmy way or the highwayâ€ù approach to governing.,Mrs. Clinton seemed to be underscoring that contrast in the video in which she announced her candidacy, delivered from an overstuffed chintz sofa. Mrs. Clinton, leaning against a needlepoint pillow, called for the start of â€œa dialogue about your ideas and mine. Because the conversation in Washington has been just a little one-sided lately, donâ€™t you think?â€ù,Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and the author of â€œYou Just Donâ€™t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation,â€ù said a â€œlistening tourâ€ù was a classic way to communicate with (and among) women.,Democrats also seem less worried these days about the old charge of being the â€œmommy party,â€ù dedicated to domestic concerns while the Republicans, â€œthe daddy party,â€ù are trusted with national security. Democratic women were often warned over the years that the stereotypes of party and sex reinforced each other.,National security remains a threshold issue for voters but is no longer such an automatic advantage for the Republicans because they have lost so much support on the war in Iraq, the polls suggest. And neither Ms. Pelosi nor Mrs. Clinton is neglecting these issues. On the campaign trail in Iowa on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton argued that all of this â€” security, maternity, affordable health care â€” was part of her potential-first-woman-president package.,â€œIâ€™m going to be asking people to vote for me based on my entire life and experience,â€ù she said. â€œThe fact that Iâ€™m a woman, the fact that Iâ€™m a mom, is part of who I am.â€ù,But there has been some debate in recent weeks about the uses of motherhood, on the left and the right. After Ms. Pelosi assumed the speakership, in a week of events that repeatedly highlighted children, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation, wrote on her blog, â€œI wonder why Pelosi, a woman I admire, seemed so keen to use her first day as speaker to portray herself as a traditional, family-first kind of woman.â€ù,Ms. vanden Heuvel added, â€œMany of the women I spoke to worry that the photo fed into the image of woman as one-dimensional.â€ù,The question flared anew in a recent exchange between Senator Barbara Boxer, also a California Democrat, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Ms. Boxer noted in a hearing that members of her own family were either too old or too young for military service, and so she would not pay a personal price for the Iraq war. She added, of Ms. Rice, â€œYouâ€™re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, with an immediate family.â€ù,Ms. Rice shot back later, â€œI thought you could still make good decisions on behalf of the country if you were single and didnâ€™t have children.â€ù",ROBIN TONER,"JAN. 29, 2007",Women Feeling Freer to Suggest â€˜Vote for Momâ€™,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/us/politics/29women.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 â€” Jeffrey T. Kuhner, whose Web site published the first anonymous smear of the 2008 presidential race, is hardly the only editor who will not reveal his reportersâ€™ sources. What sets him apart is that he will not even disclose the names of his reporters.,But their anonymity has not stopped them from making an impact. In the last two weeks, Mr. Kuhnerâ€™s Web site, Insight, the last remnant of a defunct conservative print magazine owned by the  Unification Church led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, was able to set off a wave of television commentary, talk-radio chatter, official denials, investigations by journalists around the globe and news media self-analysis that has lasted 11 days and counting.,The controversy started with a quickly discredited Jan. 17 article on the Insight Web site asserting that the presidential campaign of Senator , was preparing an accusation that her rival, ,, had covered up a brief period he had spent in an Islamic religious school in Indonesia when he was 6.,(Other news organizations have confirmed Mr. Obamaâ€™s descriptions of the school as a secular public school. Both senators have denounced the report, and there is no evidence that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign planned to spread those accusations.),In an interview Sunday, Mr. Kuhner, 37, said he still considered the article, which he said was meant to focus on the thinking of the Clinton campaign, to be â€œsolid as solid can be.â€ù But he declined to say whether he had learned the identity of his reporterâ€™s sources, and so perhaps only that reporter knows the origin of the articleâ€™s anonymous quotes and assertions. Its assertions about Mr. Obama resemble rumors passed on without evidence in e-mail messages that have been widely circulated over the last several weeks.,The Clinton-Obama article followed a series of inaccurate or hard-to-verify articles on Insight and its predecessor magazine about politics, the Iraq war or the Bush administration, including a widely discussed report on the Insight Web site that President Bushâ€™s relationship with his father was so strained that they were no longer speaking to each other about politics.,The Washington Times, which is also owned by the Unification Church, but operates separately from the Web site, quickly disavowed the article. Its national editor sent an e-mail message to staff members under the heading â€œInsight Strikes Againâ€ù telling them to â€œmake sure that no mention of any Insight storyâ€ù appeared in the paper, and another e-mail message to its Congressional correspondent instructing him to clarify to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama that The Washington Times had nothing to do with the article on the Web site.,â€œSome of the editors here get annoyed when Insight is identified as a publication of The Washington Times,â€ù said Wesley Pruden, editor in chief of The Washington Times.,And in an interview, John Moody, a senior vice president at Fox News, said its commentators had erred by citing the Clinton-Obama report. â€œThe hosts violated one of our general rules, which is know what you are talking about,â€ù Mr. Moody said. â€œThey reported information from a publication whose accuracy we didnâ€™t know.â€ù,Mr. Kuhnerâ€™s ability to ignite a news media brush fire nonetheless illustrates how easily dubious and politically charged information can spread through the constant chatter of cable news commentary, talk radio programs and political Web sites. And at the start of a campaign with perhaps a dozen candidates hiring â€œresearch directorsâ€ù to examine one another, the Insight episode may be a sign of what is to come.,To most journalists, the notion of anonymous reporters relying on anonymous sources is a red flag. â€œIf you want to talk about a business model that is designed to manufacture mischief in large volume, that would be it,â€ù said Ralph Whitehead Jr., a professor of journalism at the University of Massachusetts.,With so much anonymity, â€œHow do we know that Insight magazine actually exists?â€ù Professor Whitehead added. â€œIt could be performance art.â€ù,But hosts of morning television programs and an evening commentator on the Fox News Network nevertheless devoted extensive discussion to Insightâ€™s Clinton-Obama article, as did Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk radio hosts.,And the Fox News rival MSNBC has picked up several of Insightâ€™s other recent anonymous  â€œscoops.â€ù Among them: that Mr. Bush was afraid to fire his adviser Karl Rove because â€œhe knows too muchâ€ù; that there is a rift between President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over the presidentâ€™s support for Israel; and that Mr. Bush spent the months before the midterm elections in a bunker-mentality focused on the Iraq war and the elections to the exclusion of all else. Mr. Kuhner has appeared as a guest on both networks.,A spokesman for MSNBC declined to comment. Representatives of News World Communications, the arm of the Unification Church that owns Insight, could not be reached for comment on Sunday night.,Mr. Kuhner said, â€œOur report on this opposition research activity is completely accurate,â€ù and he argued that all major news organizations relied  on anonymous sources. Mr. Kuhner, in an editorâ€™s note on Insight, said the Web site could not afford to â€œsend correspondents to places like Jakarta to check out every fact in a story.â€ù The Web site pays up to $800 for an article.,Mr. Kuhner said he was not yet convinced by reports from officials of the elementary school that Mr. Obama attended in Indonesia about its secular history. â€œTo simply take the word of a deputy headmaster about what was the religious curriculum of a school 35 years ago does not satisfy our standards for aggressive investigative reporting,â€ù he wrote.,Insight was founded two decades ago as a conservative print magazine called Insight on the News. It started the career of the journalist David Brock, who became famous for writing sensational magazine articles and books about Anita Hill and later Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Brock later recanted much of what he had written, and now runs a liberal media group dedicated to countering what it considers be conservative bias in the news media.,Insight had thousands of subscribers, but its reputation was checkered by its false reports, which included  an assertion that President Bill Clinton was selling plots at Arlington National Cemetery to Democratic campaign donors, and,  during the Bush administration, that Saddam Husseinâ€™s purported weapons of mass destruction might have been found.,Officials of the Unification Church closed the print magazine about a year and a half ago, and tapped Mr. Kuhner to run it as a stand-alone Web site. He worked for three years, from 2000 through 2003, as an assistant national editor at The Washington Times. Before that, he was a history professor, but did not finish his dissertation. After leaving The Washington Times, he worked for a Republican policy group.,Mr. Kuhner said he insisted on editorial independence, reporting only to the board of New World Communications. Under his tenure, Insightâ€™s Web site has claimed a series of anonymous scoops, many centered on the White House. In addition to the article about Mr.  Bushâ€™s feud with his father, there was also a January 2006 report that the United States was preparing for a covert attack on Iran and a February 2006 report that Vice President Dick Cheney would step down after the midterm elections.,Mr. Kuhner said Insight stopped using bylines to encourage contributions from reporters for major news organizations.  He said such contributors could not  write what they knew under their own names for their main employers, either for fear of alienating powerful sources or because of editorsâ€™ biases.,â€œReporters in Washington know a whole lot of what is going on and feel themselves shackled and prevented from reporting what they know is going on,â€ù Mr. Kuhner said. Insight, he said, â€œis almost like an outlet, an escape valve where they can come out with this information.â€ù,â€œThe team I have has some of the most seasoned, experienced reporters in this town, so I know the material I am getting is rock-solid.â€ù he said. â€œThe reporter has to give his or her word that, â€˜It is solid, Jeff,â€™ â€ù Mr. Kuhner said.,During an interview, he invited this reporter to moonlight for Insight. â€œI will take a look at your work,â€ù he said. â€œI will do a background check. You may get a call from me.â€ù He declined to say where the contributor who offered the Clinton-Obama story worked.,â€œI said, â€˜That is a sexy story, if you can confirm it,â€™ â€ù Mr. Kuhner recalled. After Insight posted the article on Jan. 17, Mr. Kuhner said, he was disappointed to see that the Drudge Report did not link to it on its Web site as it has done with other Insight articles. So, as usual, he e-mailed the article to producers at Fox News and MSNBC.",DAVID D.

" â€” It was â€œthe golden age of foreign correspondents,â€ù  the historian Hugh Thomas wrote, a period in the late 1930s when the literary elite descended on , armed with a lust for adventure and belief in a cause.,The lure was the Spanish Civil War. In February 1936 Spanish voters elected, by a small plurality, a center-left coalition of Socialists, Communists, Republicans and Anarchists. Then in July, Gen. Francisco Franco led an uprising against the five-year-old Spanish Republic that plunged the country into civil war.,Mussolini and Hitler supported Franco, while Stalin sent advisers and arms to his opponents. The United States, Britain and France sat on the sidelines.,The writers and foreign correspondents who came to Spain invented a new kind of war journalism, reporting in first-person, eyewitness accounts the brutal feel of the battlefield.,Their two-and-a-half-year chronicle became something more, an intimate encounter with the great ideological battles of the time: between church and state; rich and poor; the aristocracy and the classless; democracy and fascism.,A traveling exhibition organized for the inauguration of the new headquarters of the Cervantes Institute in Madrid commemorates that journalism with original news clippings from publications as different as Esquire and Pravda. Titled â€œCorrespondents in the Spanish Civil War 1936-1939,â€ù it is part of a vast soul-searching throughout Spain over  the terror of the 1936 uprising and civil war that brought General Franco to power and kept his dictatorship in place until his death in 1975. The exhibition, which runs until Feb. 25 in Madrid, was shown last year at the instituteâ€™s New York offices and in Lisbon. It will travel next to three cities in France, two cities in Poland and one each in Stockholm and Moscow.,â€œThe best writers came to tell the world what was happening in Spain,â€ù said the exhibitionâ€™s curator, Carlos Garcia Santa Cecilia, a former journalist. â€œThey felt a compulsion to be here, to bear witness, to fight for their beliefs. It was the first time journalists said, â€˜I must write what I see, what I feel.â€™ â€ù,The aviator and author Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry flew in on his own plane. George Orwell took his pen to the battlefield and nearly died when he was shot through the neck. Arthur Koestler was locked up by Franco supporters.,Kim Philby, The Times of London correspondent, was already a Soviet agent gathering information under the cover of his job as a reporter. Ernest Hemingway posed for one report for The New Republic holding a rifle while lying on the battlefield.,In recent years Spain has begun to shake off the collective amnesia that had gripped it since Francoâ€™s death. Books, exhibitions, documentaries, television series and films have given stark, eloquent testimony to the Francoâ€™s silent victims.,A project to locate and dig up the hundreds of mass graves left by the firing squads of Franco rule is actively under way. Parliament is locked in a contentious debate over legislation to recognize the suffering of the victims.,The exhibition captures the power of the written word in telling the stories. â€œThis is the most painful story it has ever been my lot to handle,â€ù The Chicago Tribuneâ€™s Jay Allen wrote at the start of his report on the massacre in Badajoz in August 1936. â€œI write it at four in the morning, sick at heart and in body in the stinking patio of the pension central.â€ù,Badajoz was one of the first big towns to fall to Francoâ€™s offensive from the south, and Mr. Allen managed to find an alternate way to send his story after it was blocked by government censor. â€œThey are burning bodies,â€ù he wrote. â€œFour thousand men and women have died at Badajoz since Gen. Francisco Francoâ€™s rebel Foreign Legionnaires and Moors climbed over the bodies of their own dead through its many times blood-drenched walls.â€ù,A two-page exclusive interview with Franco by Felix Correia for Diario de Lisboa, in Portugal, in August 1936, a month after the civil war began, revealed the rebel leaderâ€™s plans for a dictatorship that would protect the Roman Catholic Church and private property.,In her dispatches Barbro  Alving, a Swedish foreign correspondent known as Bang, described how schools and hospitals struggled to stay open during the war. Martha Gellhorn, Hemingwayâ€™s lover and his future (third) wife, chronicled daily life in Madrid in a four-page article in Collierâ€™s in 1937 that established her as a serious journalist.,Not all the correspondents took the Republican side. Harold Cardozo of The Daily Mail, a Franco supporter, traveled with him.,Three journalists â€” Edward J. Neil of The Associated Press, Richard Sheepshanks of Reuters and Bradish Johnson of Newsweek â€” died near Teruel in northern Spain after their car was hit by Republican fire while they tried to report from Francoâ€™s side. Mr. Philby, who was also in the car, survived. Franco gave him a medal.,In a two-part series headlined â€œSpilling the Spanish Beansâ€ù in The New English Weekly in July 1937, Orwell laid bare the divide among anti-Franco republicans between the workers he defines as true revolutionaries and the counterrevolutionary Communists he accused of selling out to â€œbourgeois reformism.â€ù,His complex, often ambiguous analysis won him the vitriol of both the left and the right. It also formed the basis for his book â€œHomage to Catalonia,â€ù in which he wrote, â€œAs for the newspaper talk about this being a â€˜war for democracy,â€™ it was plain eyewash.â€ù,Langston Hughes, the American poet, playwright and novelist, came  to Spain â€œto write for the colored press,â€ù he wrote in The Afro American newspaper. â€œI knew that Spain had once belonged to the Moors, a colored people ranging from light dark to dark white.â€ù He described the importation of Moorish soldiers from Spanish Morocco and their slaughter on the front lines on the side of the Franco offensive.,The exhibition captures the high-stakes international diplomacy of the war. The German aerial bombing that destroyed the Basque village of Guernica in 1937 was the worst atrocity of the war, the first blitzkrieg; it also may have been the most sensitive military operation.,The Times of London buried George L. Steerâ€™s powerful eyewitness account â€” alerting the world that Hitler was helping the Spanish Fascists â€” in a single column on Page 17; The New York Times ran it at the top of the front page. â€œBritain didnâ€™t want to upset the Germans,â€ù Mr. Garcia Santa Cecilia said.,Most of the journalists took refuge in Madrid at  the  Hotel Florida, which was shelled regularly. It is now the site of a department store.,John Dos Passos wrote an article  for Esquire in 1938 from there, â€œRoom and Bath at the Hotel Florida,â€ù that included the line â€œWhen the shells keep coming in, a man somehow feels safer to be shaving and sniffing the familiar odor of the soap.â€ù,It was here that Hemingway, whose connections with both the Spanish government and the Russians kept him stocked with food and brandy, would have breakfast prepared for him every morning. It was also here that he romanced Ms. Gellhorn.,â€œThere was not one journalist in Spain who spoke well of Hemingwayâ€ù  Mr. Garcia Santa Cecilia said. â€œHe betrayed his friends. He was arrogant. He hoarded food. He was the only one with a car â€” and gasoline.â€ù,The hotel was close to the Telefonica building, where journalists had to submit their articles to an official censor before dictating them back home. The exhibition has reconstructed the operatorâ€™s desk, with one telephone headset for the journalist and another one for the censor.,It took 18 months to locate the photographs and articles â€” most of them originals â€” for the exhibition. Along the way the researchers tracked down Geoffrey Cox, who was then 26 covering local news when The  News Chronicle of Britain sent him to Madrid. He is now 96 and living in a British nursing home.,â€œI had no doubt that I was reporting on an event of capital historical importance,â€ù  Mr. Cox said in an interview included in the exhibition catalog. â€œFor the first time a force rising from the people was capable of resisting fascism.â€ù,Spain, he added, â€œwas our story.â€ù",ELAINE SCIOLINO,"JAN. 30, 2007",When Reporters Chose Sides: Spain Looks Back at Its Civil War,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/arts/design/30cerv.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Warning: Your reading of this newspaper may be hazardous to someoneâ€™s health. (Donâ€™t worry â€” not yours.) Equally fraught with danger is the casual reach for that morning coffee, the purchase of a new pashmina, a night out at the theater.,In â€œThe Fever,â€ù his corrosive exercise in theatrical conscience-baiting, , argues that virtually every transaction undertaken by an American city-dweller rests on a sturdy foundation of moral turpitude. Going about our everyday business â€” hailing a taxi, scoring a reservation at a hot restaurant, taking a nice write-off for a donation to the opera â€” we are condemning unseen victims in violence-ridden third world countries to lives of want and suffering.,So put down that venti latte, for heavenâ€™s sake.,Mr. Shawn previously performed this 90-minute monologue in private readings, beginning in 1990. Although it later moved on to less exclusive runs at various theaters in New York and abroad, â€œThe Feverâ€ù essentially and inevitably became a high-end cultural product in its own right, much as Mr. Shawnâ€™s similarly themed â€œDesignated Mournerâ€ù did a decade later in London and New York.,Mr. Shawn has amusingly chosen to acknowledge this paradox in the new production that opened last night at the Acorn Theater, directed by Scott Elliott for the New Group. The evening begins with a Champagne reception (Pommery, no less) held on the stage a half-hour before showtime. Mr. Shawn can be seen mingling with hoi polloi, the dome of his bald head bobbing genially as he exchanges chitchat with audience members. (At the reviewed performance, not-so-hoi polloi gathering onstage included the novelist William Kennedy, the playwright Tina Howe and the actor Ethan Hawke.),Think twice before you reach for that flute, however, since Mr. Shawnâ€™s aim is to make you regret every sip by inducing a bout of moral indigestion. â€œThe Feverâ€ù offers an intimate tour of the tortured consciousness of an angst-ridden, well-to-do American, but Mr. Shawnâ€™s real goal is to hold an unflattering mirror up to his well-meaning, liberally inclined audience. Itâ€™s sort of like Joseph Conradâ€™s â€œHeart of Darkness,â€ù with you, dear viewer, cast in the distasteful role of Kurtz.,But Mr. Shawnâ€™s literary models are more likely Kafka and Dostoyevsky, and at its best, â€œThe Feverâ€ù does achieve the hypnotic force of those explorers of the uncanny. The hallucinatory narrative circles back to a traumatic night spent in a hotel room in an unnamed country riven by civil war. Racked with fever, the narrator replays in his mindâ€™s eye a disturbing reel of memories from his past life. Shivering on the floor of the bathroom, as scary bugs crawl around him, he is drawn into an anguished recognition of the interior drives â€” and the brutal economic order â€” that have supported his obliviously contented, guilt-free existence. His diagnosis: a severe case of self-interest abetted by self-justification, with a smidgen of self-delusion  on top.,Mr. Shawn recounts this tale from a cozy berth in a comfortable armchair, a setting that neatly telegraphs the ultimate destination of this moral adventurer. He is framed by a truncated slice of a handsome apartment (the set is by Derek McLane), and as the monologue shifts tones, from aggrieved to inquisitive to angered, Jennifer Tiptonâ€™s lighting moves across its own spectrum, from stark to shadowy to cozy. Mr. Shawnâ€™s distinctive voice â€” it is as if a clogged sinus is speaking directly to us â€” also ranges in tone, from soft, babyish lament to a choked cry of outrage.,For the narrator of â€œThe Feverâ€ù doesnâ€™t travel a smooth path from benighted indifference to human suffering toward committed engagement in fighting the good fights. He eventually shifts from spasms of contrition for his part in the worldâ€™s injustices to coolly logical arguments for maintaining the status quo. Regarding the violence and squalor of the countries he visits, he wavers between sympathy and discomfort, compassion and repulsion.,The strength of â€œThe Feverâ€ù lies in the slippery grasp the narrator has on his own convictions, as Mr. Shawn captures with impish wit the tortuous reasoning of a mind trying to find its way back to acceptance of a state of affairs  it has discovered to be morally untenable. Mr. Shawn exposes the contradictions and compromises of the urban liberal mind with a mercilessness that is sly and at times hilarious.,Despite the density and richness of its language, however, â€œThe Feverâ€ù doesnâ€™t go very deep in its analysis of the fundamental causes of the worldâ€™s inequities or posit any rational ideas about how they could be eased. Mr. Shawn is limited by the scope of the narratorâ€™s experience, of course â€” an economist or political scientist he is not â€” but  the resulting narrative   circles around a few basic conclusions that seem thinner and more obvious the more they are illustrated or simply repeated.,â€œMy feeling in my heart a sympathy for the poor does not change the life of the poor,â€ù our narrator unsurprisingly says toward the playâ€™s conclusion. At least Mr. Shawn displays a self-knowledge to match his narratorâ€™s when he has him continue, â€œAnd artists who create works of art that inspire sympathy and good values donâ€™t change the life of the poor.â€ù,The playâ€™s damning conclusion â€” that only blood spilled on their doorsteps will bring the complacent rich to change their selfish ways â€” allows no wiggle room for incremental but steady progress in alleviating the worldâ€™s grievous economic imbalances. Its simple finger-pointing at the egoism and materialism of the complacent bourgeoisie seems reductive.,More to the point, I think Mr. Shawn overestimates his audienceâ€™s taste for self-flagellation by a good half-hour. â€œThe Feverâ€ù would cut deeper into the consciousness if it were shorter. He should know that a 90-minute monologue gives too much rein for straying thoughts about dinner plans and how best to catch a taxi after the performance.,And perhaps â€” who knows? â€” a few audience members might put that half-hour to better use, studying or working for gradual improvements in the lives of others rather than lamenting their own egoism over glasses of Champagne.,By ,; directed by Scott Elliott; sets by Derek McLane; costumes by Eric Becker; lighting by Jennifer Tipton; sound by Bruce Odland; production supervisor, Peter R.

"Rent-to-own stores charge exorbitant prices for televisions, appliances, mattresses and other items and disproportionately take aim at black, Hispanic and low-income consumers who have limited access to credit, according to an investigative report that the City Council released yesterday. A 1986 state law exempted rent-to-own companies from small-loan usury caps; and under the law, because the stores retain legal title to rented items until  the final payment is made, the product can be repossessed if a payment is missed. Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, introduced a bill in Congress last year that would force the industry to disclose more information about prices and hidden fees, and to abide by state limits on interest and financing charges. Assemblyman J. Gary Pretlow, a Westchester Democrat, introduced a similar bill last year in the Legislature. The  Council members who released the report â€” Maria del Carmen Arroyo of the Bronx and Leroy G. Comrie and Eric N. Gioia of Queens â€” said they supported both bills.

"For all that hotels have done to make their bedding more luxurious, their dÃ©cor more stylish and their lobbies smell better with a signature scent, one area that hasnâ€™t gotten much of a makeover is the in-suite dining experience, otherwise known as room service.,Certainly, hotels have tweaked their menus to keep up with changing dietary trends, offering low-fat, low-cholesterol or Atkins-friendly options as the weight-loss winds have shifted. And some high-end hotels deliver food  from a fancy restaurant on site, like the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, which lets guests enjoy meals from Jean-Georges and will even send a chef to cook in your in-suite kitchen (for an extra $75 an hour).,But at the hotels where most business travelers stay, room service has not gotten the kind of attention that has been lavished on  fancy spas and high-thread-count linens  â€”  at least not yet.,That may be about to change, as more hotels focus on their food and beverage services, with an eye toward keeping up with their guestsâ€™ increasingly sophisticated palates, nonstop work schedules  and desire for healthful meals.,For instance, Loews Hotels plans to eliminate artificial trans fats from its restaurants, room service menus and minibars by June, replacing deep-fried snacks with  PowerBars and other options. Westin Hotels and Resorts has been testing a Travelersâ€™ Renewal Menu in 20 properties that includes a smoothie to combat jet lag, oatmeal cookies and warm milk to ward off insomnia and a â€œHavana treat plateâ€ù  â€”  bananas, rice, applesauce and toast  â€”  to calm an upset stomach.,Marriott Hotels and Resorts, which has offered health-conscious â€œFit for Youâ€ù options for several years, promises to â€œrevolutionizeâ€ù in-room dining with improvements  this year that will  include new menu items that are consistent across its hotels, more regional specialties and, potentially, meals that are packaged to go, like a breakfast that can be eaten on a plane.,â€œFor many years, room service was looked at as, â€˜Gee we have to do it,â€™ but now I think more hotels are looking at it as, â€˜How can we solve our customersâ€™ problems?â€™ â€ù said Michael Beam, managing director at HVS/American Hospitality Management, a consulting firm that spent several months last year researching travelersâ€™ room service preferences.,Among the findings: people who travel 10 to 15 days a month order room service the most, and cravings are the No. 1  criteria when  they select from the menu â€” the research found hamburgers to be among the top choices â€” followed by healthfulness. But the latter category does not mean a preference for bland tofu stir-fry or poached salmon.,â€œIf anything, itâ€™s a move away from traditional â€˜healthyâ€™ items to what Iâ€™d call balanced,â€ù Mr. Beam said. â€œItâ€™s reasonable portions of good things that you wouldnâ€™t necessarily call health food.â€ù,Business travelers, it seems, would welcome any moves in that direction.,â€œIâ€™d love to be able to get a chicken breast and vegetables and some light starch thatâ€™s prepared nicely, or a selection of healthy soups,â€ù said Gabriel Levy, an executive with a digital music company in New York City, noting that these options are especially scarce on late-night menus. â€œYou can get burgers and sandwiches and that kind of stuff, but thatâ€™s exactly what I donâ€™t want to eat when itâ€™s late.â€ù,Scott Kraft, the executive vice president for marketing for a San Francisco software company, echoed that desire for well-prepared vegetables and appetizing mixed greens, adding that he would like to see more distinctive dishes. â€œYouâ€™re paying $250 a night minimum in most of these places, and then youâ€™re getting this generic room service experience,â€ù he said.,Others point to the seemingly outrageous prices sometimes charged for the smallest room service order. But despite the high charges â€”  and hotels sometimes add  a delivery charge on top of a 15 to 20 percent service charge  â€”  room service is not a cash cow.,â€œAt best, itâ€™s only marginally profitable and at worst, itâ€™s costly,â€ù said Kirby D. Payne, president of HVS/American Hospitality Management. â€œRoom service is a real complicated logistical deal. You have the normal prep time that you have in a restaurant, then you have to transfer the food to a table that has to be perfectly set, then you have to roll it some distance around the hotel.â€ù,Plus, there is the challenge of making sure soup arrives hot and ice cream cold, in the time frame promised when the order was placed.  According to research by Mr. Payneâ€™s firm, travelers tended to think that orders took  40 to 45 minutes to arrive, though in reality they usually arrived within 30 minutes.,Nevertheless, Marriott has been testing technology that lets guests use interactive touch-screens to place  orders, which may speed up delivery, and Marriott and Hilton have  introduced services that allow guests to pre-order  items to be waiting in their room upon check-in.,Another hurdle for hotels is that travelers expect to be able to nosh around the clock. But the person who cooks an order at 1 a.m. may not have the same qualifications as the chef on duty at 7 p.m., which is a lesson Lewis Peyton, a Los Angeles photographer, learned firsthand. Mr. Peytonâ€™s first job was working as a room service attendant at a luxury hotel in Australia, which he said also involved some cooking duties after the chefs went home.,â€œBe really careful about what you order after midnight,â€ù he advised, suggesting items that do not involve much skill to prepare, like a salad or a club sandwich.,For travelers on a budget, Janet Feldstein, a fund-raiser for a nonprofit organization who lives in Los Angeles, has another tip. â€œI go to Whole Foods or a takeout place and bring food back to my room  â€”  like sushi, a salad or chips and guacamole  â€”  and sometimes I order pizza,â€ù she said.,Although some hotels  do not allow food deliveries, Ms. Feldstein says she avoids that problem by giving  her cellphone number so she can pick up her pizza box outside. That raises another thorny point: what to do with the remains of your meal once you have finished dining.,Mr. Payne, the hotel consultant, said hotel staff should call to see if a guest is ready to have the tray picked up  â€”  and failing that, travelers should call to ask for a pick-up, rather than just pushing the tray into the hall.,On that note, he offered some advice most travelers have probably heard at home: â€œRemember, itâ€™s a relationship of mutual respect  â€”  these arenâ€™t servants there to pick up after you.â€ù",SUSAN STELLIN,"JAN. 30, 2007",Rewriting the Room Service Menu,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/business/30food.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In July 2005, Jeff Carenza and his girlfriend were enjoying a getaway weekend in Miami when food poisoning landed them both in the hospital. Blood tests showed that Dr. Carenza, then 29, had iron-deficiency ,.,â€œItâ€™s probably nothing,â€ù the doctor told him. â€œBut have it checked when you get home.â€ù,This type of anemia can be caused by blood loss from the intestinal tract. So back in St. Louis, where Dr. Carenza was a radiology resident at Barnes Jewish Hospital, his doctor sent him to a gastroenterologist.,One possibility was that he had a growth in his colon. But the gastroenterologist was dismissive. â€œThis is going to be a waste of my time,â€ù he said before performing a colonoscopy.,Half an hour later, Dr. Carenza received bad news.,â€œThereâ€™s a large , in your transverse colon,â€ù the gastroenterologist said. â€œItâ€™s so big I couldnâ€™t even get my scope around it. Itâ€™s probably been there for some time.â€ù,Dr. Carenza recalled, â€œMy stomach and heart were on the floor.â€ù,The diagnosis, he added, â€œwent against what weâ€™re trained to think in medical schoolâ€ù â€” that â€œ, happens to older people.â€ù,Cancer is indeed less common in adolescents and young adults than in older people. But in some ways it is more alarming.,The rates of some cancers,  including colorectal, thyroid and testicular,  are rising in people ages 20 to 39, according to the American Cancer Society. And a report released in August by the National Cancer Institute and Lance Armstrong Foundation found that even as cancer survival rates continued to improve in adults of middle age and older, the survival rates for people ages 15 to 39 had not risen substantially in more than two decades.,Cancer is the fourth-leading killer in that age group, behind accidents, , and homicides. In 2006, there were approximately 55,200 new cases of cancer in Americans 15 to 39, and 9,300 cancer deaths in that same group, according to the American Cancer Society.,â€œCancer in adolescents and young adults presents distinctive issues,â€ù said an author of that report, Dr. Karen Albritton, director of adolescent and young adult oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. â€œThe gaps in our knowledge are huge.â€ù,Some experts say more information is needed before devoting extra resources to adolescents and young adults. Dr. Bruce A. Chabner, clinical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, notes that overall survival rates of young adults are still better than those of older adults, reflecting the differences in tumor types and better tolerance of treatment in younger patients.,As of 2003, the last year for which statistics were available, the five-year survival rate was 78.5 percent for people ages 20 to 39, and  68 percent for those 40 to 69, according to the American Cancer Society.,But Dr. Albritton and others say research is needed to learn why some young adults are predisposed to cancer, why the rates of some cancers are rising in this age group and how young people may respond differently to treatment regimens â€” many of which have been tested mostly in older adults or in children.,Young peopleâ€™s tumors may have distinct genetic and biological features, these researchers say. And survivors face unique psychosocial issues â€” as they think about future ,, finishing school or starting a career.,Dr. Carenza said that looking back, he should have paid more attention to warning signs. An avid runner, he was accustomed to jogging five or six miles several days a week but for months had been unable to do so. He had also grown noticeably pale.,Still, he recalled, even his mother brushed that aside, saying: â€œWell, heâ€™s a radiologist. He works in a dark room all day.â€ù,Dr. David Dietz, the colorectal surgeon at Barnes Jewish Hospital who treated Dr. Carenza, says cancer in younger patients is typically diagnosed at a later stage because neither they nor their doctors expect them to have it. Nor do they receive routine screening, as older people do.,Dr. Carenza  has no family history of cancer, and tests after the tumor was found were negative for all known hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes.  (He completed , last March and has since been in remission, though he  sees an oncologist every three months.) Still, genetic factors may be more likely to play a role when young people get the disease,  Dr. Dietz said, adding, â€œThat is something we would like to know more about.â€ù,Asha Mevlana of Los Angeles had a family history of cancer. She found a lump in her breast at 22, but her cancer was not diagnosed for more than two years.,Ms. Mevlana received a , early on, but the results were inconclusive, as they sometimes are in younger women whose breast tissue is denser.,â€œMy doctor said, â€˜Donâ€™t worry about that; youâ€™re way too young for ,,â€™ â€ù she said. â€œWhich is of course what I wanted to hear, so I let it go.â€ù,But as the lump grew and began to hurt, Ms. Mevlanaâ€™s mother insisted she go to another doctor and get a biopsy, which confirmed that she had breast cancer.,â€œIt changes your perspective on everything,â€ù she said. â€œYou think: â€˜Wow, I could be dead next year. And there are so many things I havenâ€™t done.â€™ â€ù,Ms. Mevlana hoped to begin a career as an electric violinist. And in considering treatment options, one priority was to avoid drugs that cause neuropathy, a numbness and tingling in the hands or feet that is a side effect of some chemotherapy drugs.,The choices were â€œcompletely confusing,â€ù she said. Several doctors suggested different regimens but told her that most of them had not been well studied in younger women.,One doctor she consulted was Nadine Tung, director of the cancer risk and prevention program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. In an interview, Dr. Tung agreed that there had been few clinical trials to assess treatment regimens specifically in young adults.,â€œThat has been a problem,â€ù she said, adding that some important research was â€œfinally happening.â€ù,Unlike most young breast cancer patients, Ms. Mevlana had a tumor that was stimulated by ,. In such cases, Dr. Tung said, an important question is whether menstruation should be artificially blocked after chemotherapy, by giving the patient a shot or by removing her ovaries.,Ms. Mevlana said one doctor advised ovary removal. But she decided against it because she did not want to face the prospect of not having children.,â€œIt was just too much to give that up,â€ù said Ms. Mevlana, who is now 31 and is a professional violinist.,Dr. Albritton of Dana-Farber says that adolescents and young adults often respond differently to treatments, and that there is a â€œdisparity of attentionâ€ù to them in the medical community.,There need to be â€œmore clinical trials and more providers trained specifically for young adults,â€ù she said.,Researchers also say further work is needed to understand why the rates of certain cancers are rising among young adults.,Testicular cancer, for example, is most common among young men, and its rate is increasing. â€œWe do not know why this is the case,â€ù said Dr. Tongzhang Zheng of the Yale School of Public Health, who recently received a $5.5 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study potential genetic and environmental risk factors for the disease.,Nor is it clear why the rate of thyroid cancer, which largely affects young people, is rising, said Dr. R. Michael Tuttle, an endocrinologist and thyroid cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.,â€œThe only thing we know of that causes thyroid cancer is ,,â€ù  Dr. Tuttle said, noting that people living downwind of Chernobyl had higher rates of this cancer. â€œBut the spike in the U.S. is not being caused by radiation.â€ù,Dr. Archie Bleyer, a specialist in adolescent and young-adult cancer at the CureSearch National Childhood Cancer Foundation,  says there is a â€œuniquenessâ€ù to cancer in this age group that goes beyond the scientific and clinical issues. Not only do young patients face a distinctive array of cancers and therapies, but they are also confronted with personal challenges that are different from those affecting either older adults or children.,Young people are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured, he said â€” one reason their diseases tend to be diagnosed later. They are also more likely to feel stigmatized, since fewer of their peers have had experience with cancer.,And they face huge developmental challenges â€” entering society, joining the work force, contemplating marriage and starting a family â€” which can be overwhelming even without the burden of disease.,â€œOne of the biggest struggles in doing anything medically is to overcome the psychosocial challenges,â€ù Dr. Bleyer said.,A growing number of advocacy and outreach groups have been founded for young adults â€” many of them by cancer survivors. The Colon Club, for instance, aims to raise awareness about colon cancer in young people through projects like creating a yearly calendar of survivors. The Young Survival Coalition focuses on awareness and advocacy regarding breast cancer in young adults. And the SAMFund provides financial support to young survivors making the transition to post-treatment life.,More than 50 organizations dedicated to cancer-related issues for young adults are cataloged on a new Web site, ,, started by Steps for Living, a nonprofit communications, advocacy and support organization for young adults with cancer.,â€œWhen I was diagnosed with cancer, all I really wanted was to connect to other people my age,â€ù said the groupâ€™s founder, Matthew Zachary, 32,  of Brooklyn, who learned at 21 that he had pediatric brain cancer.,Lauren Terrazzano, who writes a weekly column for Newsday called â€œLife, With Cancer,â€ù said that for a younger person, â€œcancer can be the ultimate form of identity theft, if you let it.â€ù,Ms. Terrazzano was told she had advanced lung cancer in 2004 and has since undergone three operations, including an extrapleural pneumonectomy, in which her right lung and part of the lining of her heart were removed. She has also undergone extensive chemotherapy and radiation.,â€œOne day youâ€™re a healthy 36-year-old with long hair, black mascara and low-rider jeans,â€ù she said. â€œYouâ€™re going through the rhythms of life, going to work, going to dinner, hanging out with friends. And the next minute youâ€™re Cancer Girl.,â€œItâ€™s a hard thing to reconcile.â€ù",AMANDA SCHAFFER,"JAN. 30, 2007",Too Young for This: Facing Cancer Under 40,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/health/30canc.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A new study suggests that having many siblings may increase the risk for certain stomach cancers and that younger siblings may be more at risk than older ones.,Researchers gathered blood samples from 7,429 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii from 1967 to 1975 to determine whether they were infected with Helicobacter pylori, a childhood infection known to increase the risk for stomach , much later in life. They followed the men for 28 years, during which 261 developed gastric cancer.,From that group, the researchers selected the cases of those infected with H. pylori â€”  239, or 92 percent â€”   and compared them with a group of cancer-free, but also infected, controls. The team then looked at family size and birth order in both groups.,Among the cases with the most the virulent strain of H. pylori, called cagA, those from families with seven or more children were more than twice as likely to develop cancer as those from families with one to three children, and younger children had a higher risk than older ones.,The , appears in the January issue of PloS Medicine.,â€œItâ€™s remarkable that something thatâ€™s happening in the early years of life affects the risk of a cancer happening seven decades later,â€ù said Dr. Martin J. Blaser, the lead author and a professor of medicine at New York University. â€œItâ€™s my hypothesis that this may be a model system for other cancers.â€ù,The authors acknowledge that some factor other than family size or birth order may be the cause of the findings.

"Daily use of a common class of antidepressant may double the risk of fracture in people older than 50, a Canadian study reports.,Researchers randomly selected 5,008 people older than 50 and followed them for five years. At the start of the study, they interviewed the subjects about medications and general health. The subjects filled out yearly questionnaires reporting fractures caused by falling from a bed, chair or standing height. (A co-author of the study has received grants and honorariums from several drug companies.),One hundred and thirty-seven people, or 2.7 percent of the subjects, were daily users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.â€™s, a rate similar to that of the general populations of the United States and Canada. After controlling for the use of other psychotropic medicines, age, sex, education, height, weight, , status and other variables, daily users of S.S.R.I.â€™s were 2.1 times as likely to suffer fractures as those who did not use the medicine.

But after controlling for falls and low bone density, the risk of fracture persisted.

"A passer-by glancing through a rear window of the sanctuary at St. Thomas Church on Sunday evening might not have noticed anything amiss. The pews were filled with people whose heads were bowed in concentration, eyes closed tight; a few faces were turned heavenward in amazement or rapture.,But what had so transfixed this throng was â€œHarmonies,â€ù an Ã©tude by the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti, performed midway through a recital by the organist John Scott, a concert presented by the Miller Theater at Columbia University.,Mr. Scott, the music director at St. Thomas, recently embarked upon a complete traversal of the German Baroque master Dietrich Buxtehudeâ€™s organ works here, parceled out in 10 installments. Ligeti, by contrast, required only half of a single concert, with sufficient room remaining for the complete organ music of Jonathan Harvey, a British modernist.,Mr. Scott played Mr. Harveyâ€™s music on the churchâ€™s vast Arents Memorial Organ, a Skinner instrument built in 1913. â€œLaus Deoâ€ù offered a brisk interplay of frantic exclamations and gentler ruminations. Brittle figures flashed and spiraled upward like sparks over a campfire at the beginning of â€œFantasia,â€ù which thoroughly explored the instrumentâ€™s registrations. Surging arpeggios clashed with recorded rhythms in â€œToccata, for Organ and Tape,â€ù building to a barbarous climax.,Mr. Scott switched to the churchâ€™s Loening-Hancock organ, a more compact instrument built according to German and Dutch Baroque custom, for Ligetiâ€™s â€œRicercare: Omaggio a Girolamo Frescobaldi.â€ù The deliberately monotonous parody of 12-tone music served as a palate cleanser; what followed was unearthly, disorienting and never less than gripping. Ligeti called for the organ to be played with reduced wind pressure in â€œHarmonies,â€ù resulting in sounds that suggested by turns a consort of model-train whistles, a ghostly choir and a swarm of crotchety bassoonists.,Mr. Scott produced a jarring flurry in â€œCoulÃ©e,â€ù a perpetual-motion study that gradually ascends in pitch until the player runs out of keyboard. Saved for last was â€œVolumina,â€ù whose notorious opening chord has been responsible for the death of more than one organ. Happily the St. Thomas instrument survived, producing dissonant clusters that rippled like heat haze and bass notes that rumbled as if the subway below the church had suddenly risen to within inches of the floor.",STEVE SMITH,"JAN. 30, 2007",Lifting Ligeti With the Force of an Organ,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/arts/music/30scot.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As he notes in his remarkable new memoir, â€œWish I Could Be There,â€ù the composer Allen Shawn suffers from a veritable rainbow of ,: â€œI donâ€™t like heights,â€ù he writes. â€œI donâ€™t like being on the water. I am upset by walking across parking lots or open parks or fields where there are no buildings. I tend to avoid bridges, unless they are on a small scale. I respond poorly to stretches of vastness but do equally badly when I am closed in, as I am severely claustrophobic. When I go to a theater, I sit on the aisle. I am petrified of tunnels, making most train travel as well as many drives difficult. I donâ€™t take subways. I avoid elevators as much as possible. I experience glassed-in spaces as toxic, and I find it very difficult to adjust to being in buildings in which the windows donâ€™t open.â€ù,In short, he concludes, â€œI am afraid both of closed and of open spaces, and I am afraid, in a sense, of any form of isolation.â€ù,These phobias, Mr. Shawn goes on, have meant that he ends up â€œmissing things and harming, or losing relationships.â€ù They have circumscribed his life, and turned ordinary undertakings â€” going on a trip, visiting friends, doing errands â€” into a daunting obstacle course. The prospect of a trip makes him â€œalmost frozen with anticipatory anxiety for weeks or months in advance,â€ù and even small jaunts, like a walk down a road, require him to equip himself with â€œsafety items,â€ù like a supply of Xanax, a bottle of ginger ale, a cellphone and a paper bag â€œof the type I breathed into once, many years ago, to calm myself when I suffered a concussion.â€ù,In probing the consequences and possible causes of his phobias, Mr. Shawn has written a brave, eccentric and utterly compelling book thatâ€™s as revelatory and candid as anything ever written by Joan Didion, and as humane and scientifically fascinating as any one of Oliver Sacksâ€™s case studies.,Mr. Shawn is unsparing in his dissection of his phobias and the self-preoccupation they entail,  and he intercuts his research into the psychology of his affliction with some painfully recalled childhood memories that unfold into a thoughtful, philosophical meditation on Freud and families and identity.,The son of the famed New Yorker editor William Shawn, Allen Shawn has an older brother, Wallace, the playwright and actor; and a twin sister, Mary, who is autistic and lives in an institution in Delaware. The diagnosis of his sisterâ€™s condition and her departure, when she was 8, for a special school on Cape Cod seem to have triggered a severe case of separation anxiety in Allen, as well as fears that â€œone could be turned out of the house for being too difficult to handle,â€ù for â€œbeing too inefficient mentally, or for being too wild.â€ù,These fears amplified his own â€œterror of ,â€ù  â€”  the fear that,  being Maryâ€™s twin, he too was somehow damaged or different.,Mary had been Allenâ€™s closest companion when they were small children, and he says that his parentsâ€™ desire that he simply move on with his own life backfired: he had remained Maryâ€™s twin, â€œfinding ways to make my life parallel to hers.â€ù,â€œI canâ€™t help noticing that she, like me, is subject to â€˜attacks,â€™ â€ù Mr. Shawn writes, â€œlives within a fixed routine, resists even minute changes from what she expects, is extremely limited in her ability to travel. She is institutionalized, I am out here, â€˜freeâ€™ and â€˜functioning,â€™ yet I have managed to build some invisible walls around myself.â€ù,There were other factors that fed Allenâ€™s phobic inclinations as well: a hereditary predisposition toward phobias; a childhood desire to emulate his father (who suffered from an array of phobias, including a distaste for airplanes, bridges and elevators); and a tendency to internalize his overprotective motherâ€™s warnings about the perils of the world. Mr. Shawn recalls that she kept a watchful eye on him as a child, â€œdelaying seemingly forever the moment when I would be allowed to cross the street by myself, and cultivating a sense that I wasnâ€™t ready to â€˜handleâ€™ this or that activity, this or that scary scene in a movie.â€ù,In addition, the Shawn household, with its emphasis on discretion and denial,  seems to have been an â€œincubating environmentâ€ù for future phobias, a petri dish of unspoken emotions. The authorâ€™s father carried on a four-decade extramarital affair, and his reticence about his complicated double life (â€œit wasnâ€™t uncommon for him to eat, or at least, ,four or even five meals a day to accommodate all the important people in his lifeâ€ù) created an atmosphere in which secrecy and repression flourished.,â€œBeneath my sunniness,â€ù Mr. Shawn writes of his younger self, â€œthere was also rage that my family was somehow a sham, that I was a twin who wasnâ€™t supposed to feel like one, that we were Jews with an Irish name. I felt that huge passions and angers that somehow couldnâ€™t be mentioned were seething within me and within the house and that the world was raw and crude but had to be referred to politely in perfect sentences. There were blinding hatreds in the air that couldnâ€™t be named; there was sex that couldnâ€™t be spoken of; there were deep mysteries that had to be sanitized and secularized; there was deep competitiveness and there were deep character flaws that couldnâ€™t be acknowledged.â€ù,Mr. Shawn says he â€œheld in my feelings and my problems, and they grew without my even knowing it.â€ù Although he wasnâ€™t agoraphobic as a child, he began, after college, to build his â€œlife around the experiences in which I felt calm.â€ù Since then, he now realizes, he has been dragging his childhood along with him like a giant, melancholy shadow.,With phobias, of course, itâ€™s impossible to point to one precipitating cause, one formative event, and in Mr. Shawnâ€™s case, a constellation of events, experiences and environmental influences helped reinforce any existing tendency to bury his difficulties inside. In â€œWish I Could Be There,â€ù his inquiry into his affliction becomes an inquiry into his own past, and that inquiry, in turn, becomes an eloquent meditation upon the mysteries of personality and family, and the ingenious, often debilitating ways in which the human mind can try to cope with the exigencies of the world.,â€œIn a way,â€ù Mr. Shawn writes, â€œI had been raised to feel that the world was a kind of Pandoraâ€™s box that was simply too frightening to ever fully open. As an adult I found a way to open it a bit, while sitting on top of it too.â€ù",MICHIKO KAKUTANI,"JAN. 30, 2007","Recalling a Literary Family, and Phobias",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/books/30kaku.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The telephone calls and e-mail messages started streaming in just hours after the first news articles  reported that a uterine transplant might be in the works. One caller was a 25-year-old Alabama woman who was born without a uterus. Another was a 33-year-old Illinois woman who had a hysterectomy at 24.,All of the women, desperate to carry a child of their own, had heard that doctors at New York Downtown Hospital had harvested wombs from eight brain-dead human donors, laying the groundwork for the first human uterine transplant in the Western world. They wanted to be candidates for transplants. (One caller even offered to be a living donor, saying she had already had children and no longer needed her uterus.),The hospital has no immediate plans for a uterine transplant, but even the possibility has been greeted with opprobrium by many medical ethicists, , doctors and patient advocates. They said that a uterine transplant is a radical and potentially dangerous solution to a problem that is not life-threatening and that can be resolved in other ways, like using a surrogate. The risks, they said, extend not only to the mother but also to the unborn child.,When and where an actual transplant of a uterus might take place is anyoneâ€™s guess. Dr. Bruce D. Logan, the president of New York Downtown Hospital, said the hospital was supportive of the research but did not expect to perform a uterine transplant â€œany time in the foreseeable future.â€ù,The only human uterine transplant to date was carried out in Saudi Arabia in 2000 and used an organ from a live donor, which is not being considered by the New York researchers, but the uterus failed after three months and had to be removed.,Still, Dr. Giuseppe Del Priore, the lead author of the study that described the uterus harvesting in this monthâ€™s issue of the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, said doctors needed to be able to offer fertility patients more options. Dr. Del Priore, a , specialist, explained that he became interested in uterine transplants after seeing young women whose surgical treatments left them unable to bear children, and who were desperate to start a family. â€œThis is where we get our inspiration,â€ù he said.,While the risks would be enormous, he said, some women would be willing to assume them in exchange for the mere possibility of having a baby. Many women who have had transplants of other kinds â€” life-saving kidneys, hearts and lungs â€” have been able to carry pregnancies to term.,â€œYouâ€™ve got to put this in its proper context,â€ù Dr. Del Priore said. â€œTransplant patients have babies, sick patients have babies, and it generally turns out well. The mothers-to-be are willing to take that risk.â€ù,But while the desire to bear a child may be an intense and passionate one, fertility advocates and medical experts called for more research on animals before another uterine transplant is attempted in humans. â€œFor many women, experiencing , is a central part of being a woman, and they will go to many extremes to have that experience,â€ù said Pamela Madsen, executive director of the American Fertility Association, a nonprofit education and advocacy group. â€œBut just because we want it, does that mean it is worth the risks? There are two lives involved here.â€ù,For women who do not have a uterus or a properly functioning uterus, Ms. Madsen said, â€œIt feels like a loss, and it is a loss.â€ù,â€œBut how far do we go?â€ù Ms. Madsen said. â€œEspecially when there are other kinds of solutions that may not fill the emotional gap of experiencing pregnancy but will result in a healthy baby, with very little risk.â€ù,Studies have yielded pregnancies and live births in mice that received uterine transplants, but the rodents received organs from donors that were very closely related or genetically identical, the experts said.,A transplant patient who became pregnant would face many potential complications. She would be required to take immunosuppressive medications that could be toxic and may harm the unborn child, she may develop infections or other complications from surgery, and there is always a risk the organ would fail or be rejected. About half of all , patients who become pregnant have preterm births and low birth weight babies, and many of the women develop high , and pre-eclampsia, a dangerous condition in which a pregnant womanâ€™s blood pressure threatens her health and the childâ€™s.,With a uterus transplant, there is an additional layer of complexity, because the pregnancy would be occurring within the transplanted organ, and no one knows how the transplant would adapt to pregnancy.,â€œThis is very complex, and one woman dying from this is going to be really one too many,â€ù said Dr. Tommaso Falcone, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the Cleveland Clinic and a reproductive endocrinologist who has done research on ovarian transplantation. â€œIf we were going to cure cancer and save humanity, Iâ€™d say take the risks and take it to humans as quickly as possible. But weâ€™re looking at patients with essentially a nonlethal condition.â€ù,These patients are also a distinct minority, he said, estimating that fewer than 1 percent of his patients are infertile because they lack a uterus.,Willing patients would be put through a grueling process, according to a description provided by Dr. Del Priore and his colleague Dr. Jeanetta Stega. Any candidate for the surgery would first have to undergo in-vitro fertilization, and have a ready supply of frozen embryos for implantation after the transplant. The doctors said they would not want to put a woman through a transplant only to discover later that she was infertile for another reason, like an inability to produce eggs. And in any case, intercourse might be prohibited after the transplant, to minimize the risk of infection.,The surgery would have to take place quickly after a compatible  organ donor was identified.,The transplant surgery would involve a vertical abdominal incision in the patient. The cervix of the donated uterus would be attached to the patientâ€™s vagina and the uterus would be connected to four blood vessels, two on each side, Dr. Stega said. She estimated that that part of the surgery would last one to two hours. After surgery, the patient would be started on a regimen of immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection of the new organ.,Once the womanâ€™s condition was stable, she could have embryos implanted in the uterus, a procedure that is not always successful. If she became pregnant, she would be considered a high-risk patient, and would be closely monitored by a team of medical experts throughout her pregnancy.,The plan would be to deliver the baby by Caesarean section, and perform a hysterectomy to remove the uterus and prevent any additional risk of transplant-related complications, the doctors said.,One of the many unknowns involves the health of the babies. Though registries that track pregnant transplant recipients report relatively low rates of birth defects, critics say the registries are voluntary, the follow-up on the children is spotty and little is known about developmental and cognitive delays in the children.,Even Dr. Del Priore says a uterine transplant is â€œthe last option.â€ù,â€œWe want to discourage people from thinking this is an easy option,â€ù he said. â€œThe entire family unit needs to understand the magnitude of the decision and the experimental nature of the procedure.â€ù,Aimee Sheppard, a 25-year-old from Falkville, Ala., said she was aware of the risks but still wanted a chance to bear her own child. She found out when she was 13 that she was born without a uterus; her sister served as a surrogate and carried Ms. Sheppardâ€™s daughter, who is now 18 months old.,â€œIâ€™ve read up about it,â€ù Ms. Sheppard said. â€œTo me itâ€™s a small price to pay to be able to carry my own child.â€ù",RONI RABIN,"JAN. 30, 2007",Prospect of Womb Transplant Raises Hopes and Red Flags,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/health/30womb.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But how much does it really add to your waistline?,Last year, a group of researchers carried out what may be the most extensive study on the subject to date. Their conclusion: In most women, neither the pill nor the patch seems to add any pounds at all.,Of 44 previous studies that the researchers combined and analyzed, 3 found no difference between women who took hormonal contraceptives and those who took a placebo.

"I had run way too far for my level of training, and I knew it. But I had gotten lost, and the fastest way back to my car was to run. The next day, my left forefoot hurt so much I could hardly walk, so I did just what you might expect â€” I checked the Internet to see what sort of injury I might have and what to do about it.,My  search was frustrating and unhelpful. But  I ended up getting just the advice I needed from an unexpected source. And I came away with this lesson: These days, when it is oh so easy to order sophisticated medical tests, sometimes the best test, and the best treatment, can be low-tech.,After I was hurt, I did just what doctors worry that their patients will do. I searched medical Web sites for a diagnosis I could accept. When I did not like the one I found, I tried to convince myself that it had to be  wrong.,The Web  diagnosis was a stress fracture, a hairline crack in a bone. It sounded bad. It could take months to heal. I might need to immobilize the entire foot and walk around on crutches and then    go through weeks of rehabilitation.,I told myself that I didnâ€™t have a stress fracture, that there were aspects of my injury that did not seem to fit. I kept running, four to six miles every other day. Still, I was not getting better.,Finally, in December, six weeks after the injury, I gave in and called one of the few orthopedists in my area who accepts my health insurance. The first available appointment was for Jan. 16. I took it.,Then I wrote about my injury, as part of a longer article for The New York Times about running while hurt. As soon as it appeared, on Jan. 11, I began getting e-mail from readers. A podiatrist told me that I definitely had a stress fracture and had better stop running. A trainer said I had injured a tendon attached to my big toe (he had no way of knowing that the injury was at the base of my third toe).  And Paul A. April, a rheumatologist in Tulsa, Okla., said he thought it was either a stress fracture or something called extensor tendinitis. â€œIâ€™d love to hear what the doctor finds,â€ù he added.,I looked up extensor tendinitis online:  an inflammation of a tendon that straightens the toe. I hadnâ€™t found that injury when I first searched the Web, but it sounded right.,On Jan. 16, I finally saw the orthopedist and, of course, mentioned extensor tendinitis. All I got was a cursory exam and an X-ray. When the X-ray showed normal bone, the orthopedist said I needed an M.R.I. His office said someone  would call me when my insurer approved it. Then I could schedule it. Then I could return to see the doctor and learn what the scan showed.,I e-mailed Dr. April in Oklahoma telling him what had happened. â€œGratuitous advice may be worth nothing, but here goes,â€ù he replied. â€œ, examination should have revealed tenderness in the distal forefoot and even an increase in pain with forced downward pressure on the toes. If that was the case, then a local injection of a corticosteroid in a small amount with lidocaine or something similar into the extensor tendon sheath would produce relief of pain within minutes and hopefully this would last.â€ù,That sounded great. I could rule out a stress fracture and cure the inflammation all at once. If that did not work, I did not have extensor tendinitis.,I called the orthopedist to see whether he would give an injection. All I could get was an assistantâ€™s voicemail saying not to expect a reply for 48 hours because she was busy and, by the way, she does not work on Fridays. It was a Wednesday. (Thirteen days later, I still have not heard from her.)  I also called my internist to see whether she would give an injection. The answer, her nurse said, was no.,Finally, I called an orthopedist who does not accept my insurance and asked whether he would inject cortisone into the tendon sheath of my foot. His assistant knew just what I was talking about.,â€œYou want to rule out a stress fracture?â€ù she asked.,The doctor would do it, for $277. I said that I would be there the next day and that  I would pay.,The injection cured me. It also saved my insurer more than $1,000 for an M.R.I. and subsequent doctorsâ€™ appointments. But how much simpler to do what the Tulsa doctor recommended and the second orthopedist did: carefully examine my foot, ask about the injury, see that my symptoms seemed more like tendinitis than a stress fracture and simply give the injection.,As for Dr. April, my correspondent in Tulsa, he has learned something, too.,â€œThe idea of telephone medicine seems to be an easy way to make a living if I were inclined to that,â€ù he wrote. â€œIn your case, I was intrigued by a simple problem, the solution of which seemed to be stalled. It really was no big deal, but I loved doing it.â€ù",GINA KOLATA,"JAN. 30, 2007",When the Simple Solution Is the Right One,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/health/30case.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A bellow of Southern pride, tinny in a cellphone speaker, sounds at the bedside of a sleeping teenager. Itâ€™s â€œSweet Home Alabama.â€ù This is morning in Hoover, Ala., home of sublime high school football, as well as of MTVâ€™s pious reality series â€œTwo-a-Days,â€ù which begins its second season tonight. The song is a wake-up call.,Mark, the lunky and sweet defensive end, stirs. Shutting off the phone, he also shakes off the memory of last nightâ€™s loss â€” by two touchdowns, on the home field. For the Hoover High School Buccaneers, this loss precludes a top national ranking. Nothing the team does now, in Markâ€™s senior year, will make up for that loss. The best it can hope for is to win state, but Hoover always wins state. So, actually, the best they can hope for is not to , state. What a drag of a way to start the day.,And what a drag of a way, really, to start a show. â€œFriday Night Lights,â€ù NBCâ€™s as-yet-undefeated fictional series about high school football, also started by putting its team way in the hole: on the debut episode, the quarterback ended up paralyzed. But an existential blow like that is the kind that drama was invented to address. A disqualification from national rankings in Game 1, on the other hand, is just a closed door. It puts dramatic limits, not possibilities, on a television series.,Nonetheless, the boys of Hoover who are also reality stars now obediently seek more reasons to play football. Or should I say to play â€œthis ballgame,â€ù or â€œthis football gameâ€ù? These phrases come from Rush Propst, the teamâ€™s picturesque coach, who combines tough and tender so tastily that in him it seems to be a blend of pop.,The wonderfully nonterse, redundant way that sports people refer to their object of affection â€” this ballgame, this ball club, this football program â€” reaches a crescendo in his oratory style. Coach Propst is always ready to revisit first principles, to build the sport from the ground up. What are these padded kids even doing there? Foot. Ball.,Just as â€œLaguna Beachâ€ù was originally MTVâ€™s reality answer to Foxâ€™s fictional â€œOC,â€ù â€œTwo-a-Daysâ€ù (the title refers to a teamâ€™s days of double practice sessions) could be viewed as a documentary counterpart to â€œFriday Night Lights.â€ù Like that NBC show, MTVâ€™s show features cheerleaders, an almost exclusively white Southern team, and boys from modest homes who turn gladiatorial on the football field.,And, of course, thereâ€™s a speechifying and self-sacrificing coach. At one point Mark says, â€œI do love Friday nights, when those lights turn on.â€ù,But donâ€™t expect â€œTwo-a-Daysâ€ù to wallop â€œFriday Night Lights,â€ù as â€œLaguna Beachâ€ù did â€œThe OCâ€ù As a â€œFriday Night Lightsâ€ù obsessive, I intend to use â€œTwo-a-Daysâ€ù instead as a companion piece, and Iâ€™ll watch it as long as â€œFriday Night Lightsâ€ù stays on the air. High school football makes a plangent subject for fiction â€” particularly television and film â€” but it requires art to cut against the sportâ€™s intrinsic wordlessness, as well as the reticence of the players. It needs art to give it lift.,Without the script and generous camerawork of â€œFriday Night Lights,â€ù all the good lines on â€œTwo-a-Daysâ€ù go to the coach â€” and the plays, unchoreographed and unmiked for the television audience, are hard to decipher.,Dave Sirulnick and Amy Bailey, executive producers for MTV; Jason Sciavicco and Jesse James Dupree, executive producers, Humidity Entertainment.",VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN,"JAN. 30, 2007","In High School Football, Crunch Time Can Be Literal",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/arts/television/30heff.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sixty years ago, a group of physicists concerned about nuclear weapons created the Doomsday Clock and set its hands at seven minutes to midnight. Now, the clockâ€™s keepers, alarmed by new dangers like ,, have moved the hands up to 11:55 p.m.,My first reaction was a sigh of relief. After all, the 1947 doomsday prediction marked the start of a golden age. Never have so many humans lived so long  â€”  and maybe never so peacefully  â€”  as during the past 60 years. The per-capita rate of violence, particularly in the West, seems  remarkably low by historical standards.  If the clockâ€™s keepers are worried once again, their track record suggests weâ€™re in for even happier days.,But thereâ€™s one novel twist that gives me pause. When the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced two weeks ago in Washington that it was adjusting the clock, it was joined in a trans-Atlantic press conference by scientists at the Royal Society in London. One of them was the societyâ€™s president, Martin Rees, a new breed of doomsayer.,Dr. Rees, a cosmologist at Cambridge and Britainâ€™s astronomer royal, doesnâ€™t just issue gloomy predictions. He doesnâ€™t just move the hands of an imaginary and inscrutable clock. (Its keepers have never explained what one of their minutes equals on anyone elseâ€™s clock or calendar.),No, Dr. Rees is braver. He gives odds on doomsday and offers to bet on disaster. In his 2003 book, â€œOur Final Hour,â€ù he gives civilization no more than  a 50 percent chance of surviving until 2100.,Dr. Rees is not a knee-jerk technophobe  â€”  he expects great advances as researchers around the world link their knowledge  â€”  but he fears that progress will be undone by what he calls the new global village idiots. Heâ€™s sure enough of himself to post an offer on Long Bets, a clever innovation on the Web that Stewart Brand helped start with money from Jeff Bezos, the founder of ,.,Long Bets is a nonprofit foundation that calls itself an â€œarena for competitive, accountable predictions.â€ù It lets anyone make a prediction and take wagers on it, with the proceeds going to a charity named by the winner. The bets made so far are from $200 to $10,000, on topics ranging from the driving habits of Americans in 2010 to whether the universe will stop expanding. Mitchell Kapor, the software guru, is betting that in 2029 no computer will have passed the Turing test (by conversing so much like a human that you couldnâ€™t tell the difference).  The physicist Freeman Dysonâ€™s money is on the first extraterrestrial lifeâ€™s  being found somewhere other than a planet or its satellite.,Five years ago, Dr. Rees  posted ,: â€œBy 2020, bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event.â€ù He reasoned that â€œby 2020 there will be thousands  â€” even millions â€” of people with the capability to cause a catastrophic biological disaster. My concern is not only organized terrorist groups, but individual weirdos with the mindset of the people who now design computer viruses.â€ù,He didnâ€™t get any takers on ,, which seems to me a missed opportunity. So Iâ€™ve posted an offer there to bet him $200  â€”  not a huge sum, but enough to put both our reputations on the line. I realize that betting on disaster may sound ghoulish, but neither of us will personally profit (if I win, the money goes to the International Red Cross). And I think bets like this serve a purpose.,Besides stimulating public debate, they focus the issue and discipline prophets. No matter how good their intentions, prophets face strong temptations to hype. In the current issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Dr. Rees wryly describes what happened in 2003 when he turned in a manuscript titled, â€œOur Final Century?â€ù,â€œMy British publisher removed the question mark from the bookâ€™s title,â€ù he recalls, â€œand the U.S. publisher changed it to â€˜Our Final Hour.â€™ Pessimism, it seems, makes for better marketing.â€ù,It doesnâ€™t make for better public policy though. Heralds of the bioterror apocalypse have actually worsened the problem of bioterror, as Milton Leitenberg points out in a 2005 report for the Strategic Studies Institute of the United States Army War College.,Mr. Leitenberg is a scholar at the University of Maryland who has been studying biological weapons for decades â€” and debunking wild predictions. Dr. Rees is not alone. Senator Bill Frist called bioterrorism â€œthe greatest existential threat we have in the world todayâ€ù and urged a military effort that â€œeven dwarfs the Manhattan Project.â€ù,Such rhetoric, Mr. Leitenberg says, has had the perverse effect of encouraging terrorists to seek out biological weapons. But despite  the much-publicized attempts of Al Qaeda and a Japanese group to go biological, terrorists havenâ€™t had much luck, because itâ€™s still quite hard for individuals or nongovernmental groups to obtain, manufacture or deploy biological weapons of mass destruction.,Mr. Leitenberg says the biggest threat is of a state deploying biological weapons, and he notes the encouraging decline in the number of countries working on this technology. Meanwhile, though, America has been so spooked by the horror-movie scenarios that itâ€™s pouring money into defense against biological weapons. Dr. Leitenberg says thatâ€™s a mistake, both because it diverts resources from more serious threats  â€”  like natural diseases and epidemics  â€”  and because it could start a new biological arms race as other countries understandably fear that the United States is doing more than just playing defense.,Itâ€™s possible, as Dr. Rees fears, that terrorists will get a lot more sophisticated at biotech in the next decade, or that researchers will make some terrible mistake. The technology is getting cheaper and spreading rapidly. But so are the tools for preventing and coping with mistakes.,Whatever happens, I donâ€™t expect biotechnology to pose an â€œexistential threat.â€ù The disaster predicted by Dr. Rees would be horrific, but humanity has survived worse, like the , epidemic of 1918 that killed tens of millions of people. I know there are fears  of new microorganisms or nanobots gobbling up our species, but Iâ€™m confident  weâ€™d somehow stop the Doomsday Clock from striking midnight.,In fact, the wager Iâ€™d really like to make with Dr. Rees is that weâ€™ll make it to 2100. Iâ€™ve posted , on Long Bets, and Iâ€™d be glad to give him better odds than the 50-50 chance he gives civilization of surviving the century.,I even think one of us might survive to see the payoff, although my techno-optimism has its limits. I hope some version of me will be around in 2100, but I wouldnâ€™t bet on it.",,"JAN. 30, 2007",Can Humanity Survive?

"Inserting tubes in children with persistent fluid in the ear does not lead to better developmental outcomes as the children age, a new ,.,Tympanostomy, or the insertion of tubes to drain the fluid and improve hearing, is one of the most common pediatric operations and is generally believed to help prevent developmental problems. But this study, published on Jan. 18 in The New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that   tubes in otherwise healthy children has no effect on development through age 11.,The researchers studied 429 children younger than 2 months with persistent episodes of fluid in the middle ear. The children were randomly assigned in a clinical trial to undergo tympanostomy promptly or six to nine months later. At the same time, researchers randomly selected a comparison group of 241 children who had persistent fluid in their ears but were not eligible for the clinical trial; almost none of  those children received ear tubes.,Examinations at ages 9 to 11 with  tests of hearing, speech and academic skills showed  no significant difference between the children who received early tube placement and those who received later placement. Among the children not eligible for the trial, correlations between the duration of episodes of fluid in the ear for various periods in the first three years of life and developmental outcomes at ages 9 to 11 were generally insignificant.,â€œThese findings do not apply to children with acute infections,â€ù said Dr. Jack L. Paradise, the lead author and a professor of , at the University of Pittsburgh. â€œBut with children whose only problem is fluid in the ear, we should be conservative and wait at least a year before considering tubes.â€ù",NICHOLAS BAKALAR,"JAN. 30, 2007",Child Care: Ear Tubes Not Found to Affect Development,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/health/30chil.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beethovenâ€™s three most famous piano sonatas have names. You know what they are. The more-than-casual listener will identify three, arguably four more, also with poetic titles attached. Add to these the last three sonatas, which no one interested in this composerâ€™s late period will have avoided. This leaves 22 Beethoven piano sonatas that, aside from music students, hardly anyone knows at all.,Garrick Ohlssonâ€™s three-recital series at Alice Tully Hall, which began on Sunday afternoon, is valuable, among other reasons, for its use of this underused resource. Classical-music recording executives and programmers comb the past for fresh repertory, but these splendid products of a great manâ€™s workshop seem rarely to make it outside the teacherâ€™s studio.,Mr. Ohlsson used two of the Big Three as bookends for Sundayâ€™s program, the â€œPathÃ©tiqueâ€ù and the â€œAppassionata,â€ù with lesser-known works (Op. 22 and Op. 10, No. 2) in between. The Opus 22 Sonata in B flat is a maze of virtuosity, its acrobatics and intricacies capable of publicly humiliating established performers. Other musicians, I am sure, keep its difficulties (and unfortunately its charms) to themselves. Certainly Beethoven must have been a very good pianist.,The Opus 10 Sonata in F, light as a feather, is more manageable and was treated here as a kind of comedy routine, with cross-handed passages as rim shots followed by pratfalls. For 14-year-old pianists wondering what the racing finale really ought to sound like, Mr. Ohlsson offered instruction. Elsewhere the playing offered drama without histrionics and heart-on-sleeve feelings with no loss of dignity. Mr. Ohlsson remembers that Beethoven the wild-eyed revolutionary was also a spiritual child of Haydn and a more decorous time.,This was pianism technically clear and confident, and unafraid to turn the finale of the â€œAppassionataâ€ù into a calculated frenzy. The last movement of Opus 22 seemed almost perversely  slow, as if some point about oneness of tempo were being made. Iâ€™m also not used to the heavily accented, long appoggiaturas at the end of the slow movement of the â€œPathÃ©tique,â€ù but maybe Mr. Ohlsson has some musicology up his sleeve Iâ€™m unaware of.,The second program, on Feb. 25, offers the splendid early Sonata in C; the endearing, much later two-movement F sharp Sonata, of which Beethoven was fond; and Lisztâ€™s arrangement of Beethovenâ€™s Fourth Symphony. For a little â€œMoonlight,â€ù you will have to wait until April 1, but to judge from Sundayâ€™s big crowd, getting in might be hard.",BERNARD HOLLAND,"JAN. 30, 2007","Digging Past the Familiar to Find Beethoven Treasures, Some Knotty and Some Nice",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/arts/music/30ohls.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A long-anticipated encounter between two giants of avant-garde theater is currently taking place in New York City â€” not on a stage but at an art gallery.,One of the works in ,â€™s â€œVoom  Portraitsâ€ù at the Paula Cooper Gallery â€” an exhibition (also at the Phillips de Pury & Company gallery) of high-definition video portraits of celebrities posed nearly motionless in drolly theatrical costumes and settings â€” is a 30-minute, continuously looped, stunningly beautiful video of Winona Ryder as the character Winnie in Samuel Beckettâ€™s play â€œHappy Days.â€ù,The collection of portraits (which includes Brad Pitt, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Isabella Rossellini) is the product of a commission Mr. Wilson accepted several years ago from Voom HD Networks, a company devoted to  high-definition television channels, which provided the technology and production expertise for the shows.,â€œWinona Ryder,â€ù however, a 15-by-27-foot image projected in Paula Cooper Galleryâ€™s large, main space, is truly a work apart. It shows Mr. Wilson at his most perceptive concerning the implications of both his means and his subject, and it deserves to be considered one of his most penetrating theatrical creations.,Mr. Wilson has made frequent admiring comments about Beckett over the years but, to the disappointment of many, has never directed one of his plays. In a sense, the two are naturally matched, since both are known for punctiliously sculptured stage pictures and slow, deliberate action.,In other ways, though, theyâ€™re an odd couple: the maestro of marathon performance with his famously damaged relationship to language might have reason to fear the self-effacing, Nobel-winning wordsmith whose severe verbal economy gave new meaning to theatrical brevity.,As it happens, â€œWinona Ryderâ€ù employs no language. Not a word from Beckett or anyone else. The piece is nevertheless an exquisite distillation of Beckettâ€™s worldview, made from some of the most unlikely material imaginable: celebrity and high technology.,In â€œHappy Days,â€ù a woman buried up to her waist (and then her neck) in a mound of earth fills time, under unremitting light, with ordinary activities like brushing her teeth, telling stories and attempting conversation with her absurdly indolent spouse. In the Wilson portrait, Ms. Ryder, wearing a flamboyant floral headdress, is alone and buried in a mound up to her shoulders, with several of Winnieâ€™s signature objects (purse, gun and toothbrush) arranged with tantalizing precision in front of her.,Mostly, Ms. Ryder stares forward, stock still, occasionally blinking, accompanied by vaguely pastoral, tinkling music by Michael Galasso. As the light in the picture cycles through excruciatingly slow changes, tinting the mound ochre, then chartreuse, then mauve and black as night falls, she gradually closes her eyes and turns her head to the side as if sleeping â€” her half-obscured headdress then suggesting a Nefertiti crown.,Some of the poignancy in the portrait comes from the natural harmony of two major artists, both deeply invested in the literal passage of time and in its use as subject matter. The implications run deeper here, though, because of the juxtaposition of the vanity of celebrity with the memory of a play that famously undercuts human vanity. All Beckettâ€™s dramas are ruthless exposers of egotism, the petty narcissism of stars, and Mr. Wilsonâ€™s Voom portraits turn their own different sort of microscope on  stars.,In this case, a celebrity notoriously wounded by fame is framed as the pre-eminent figure of vulnerability (and indomitability) in modern drama. In that context, the immortality of stardom becomes an ironic reference, as does the technical perfection of the high-definition imagery. The piece, almost shockingly, forges a meaningful marriage between the most confident of Apollonian expertise and â€œthe expression that there is nothing to express.â€ù",JONATHAN KALB,"JAN. 30, 2007","Robert Wilson, Beckett and a Celebrity From the Neck Up",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/arts/design/30wils.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The concert by the Hamburg Symphony at the Metropolitan Museum on Friday night had the makings of an event. The orchestra, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with an American tour, was playing for the first time in New York. On the podium was Andrey Boreyko, its 49-year-old Russian music director, whose star is on the rise. Robert McDuffie, a popular, respected American violinist, was the soloist.,Things donâ€™t always go according to plan. The museumâ€™s Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium is not especially well suited to orchestras. Here the boxy acoustic rendered string tone dry and thin, and laid bare even the slightest imperfections among wind and brass players. That was the likeliest explanation for the lack of blend and bloom in Mendelssohnâ€™s â€œHebridesâ€ù Overture. The performance was sound enough, structurally speaking; Mr. Boreykoâ€™s impetuous account built to an impressively stormy climax.,Mr. McDuffie approached Tchaikovskyâ€™s Violin Concerto with oversize gestures and heart-on-sleeve emotionalism. The first movement is treacherously difficult for the soloist, and Mr. McDuffie seemed to revel in his exertion, bearing down hard and occasionally producing a coarse, grainy tone. Mr. Boreyko provided superb support, offering enough flexibility to accommodate Mr. McDuffieâ€™s flamboyance. Unable to contain its excitement, the audience burst into sustained applause at the end of the movement.,In the canzonetta, Mr. McDuffie summoned a subtle glow, which was well matched by flute and clarinet soloists. His exuberance in the finale compensated for anemic sound from the cellos and basses. Urged along by Mr. Boreyko, the performance caught fire at the very end.,Brahmsâ€™s Symphony No. 2 fared less well. One never questioned Mr. Boreykoâ€™s elegant, genial conception. It was clear too that the players â€” from Brahmsâ€™s hometown after all â€” felt the music. How else to explain the mellow radiance of a passage for horns, winds and low strings in the second movement or the playful brio of the third? But too often reverie was thwarted by a smudged attack, a note slightly missed or some other blemish cruelly exposed in an unforgiving hall.",STEVE SMITH,"JAN. 30, 2007",A Debut and a Fervent Violinist,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/arts/music/30symp.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Duke Ellingtonâ€™s quip that there are only two kinds of music â€”  good  and the other kind â€”  was apposite on Saturday night at Merkin Concert Hall in a concert celebrating ,â€™s 251st birthday. The uninitiated might have heard two kinds of music, classical and jazz. But in Ellingtonâ€™s terms there was only one: excellent.,The concert involved the meeting of two crack musicians, the cellist Matt Haimovitz (who has made a specialty of exploring the places where classical music and other forms can intersect) and the jazz pianist Uri Caine. The first half was straight Mozart; the second, Mozart refracted through the prism of Mr. Caineâ€™s mind in pieces that donâ€™t quite merit the vexed label of crossover. It is, after all, part of the jazz tradition to work famous tunes into new pieces of your own.,This might sound like an exercise in comparing the strait-laced and the funky. But the straight part of the program was too riveting to merit any label other than good music. Mr. Haimovitz brought in two colleagues from McGill University in Montreal, where he teaches â€” Jonathan Crow, a violinist, and Douglas McNabney, a violist â€” to join him in the Divertimento in E flat (K. 563), a drop-dead gorgeous piece  (which this trio recorded last year).,They played it ravishingly. Mr. Haimovitz makes a huge, dark sound, and Mr. Crow has one of those sweet, singing violin tones that seduces the ear. The piece is Mozartâ€™s longest instrumental work, but it didnâ€™t seem long enough.,Mr. Caine set the tone for the second half with an exegesis on the famous C major piano sonata that led that little tune into a wilderness of challenging rhythmic twists, bouncing it off unfamiliar harmonies and even taking it on a spin through another familiar beginnersâ€™ piece, â€œChopsticks.â€ù He then brought out his five-person ensemble, which opened in a somber fog until the theme of the G minor symphony suddenly crystallized out of the chaos.,Mr. Caineâ€™s arrangements riffed on Mozart, first acknowledging that  composerâ€™s autonomy, then exploring how far afield a development section or a cadenza could go, sometimes with appended squiggles of computer sound. The ensemble, and approach, were at their best in breathtaking displays of hell-for-leather virtuosity, in, for instance,  their version of â€œDer HÃ¶lle Racheâ€ù from â€œDie ZauberflÃ¶te.â€ù,Slow movements were slightly more difficult: the familiar tunes threatened to become merely treacly, despite the talent of the players (including Joyce Hammann on violin, Ralph Alessi on trumpet and Jim Black, a wonderfully evocative drummer).,Mr. Haimovitz joined the group for the Sinfonia Concertante in E flat, and exchanged (musical) views with Ms. Hammann in a semi-improvised cadenza so articulate that it drew involuntary laughs from the audience.",ANNE MIDGETTE,"JAN. 30, 2007","Playing Mozart and His Pal, Funky Funky, uh, Mozart",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/arts/music/30merk.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 29 â€” Three United States senators sounded off on Monday about the slow pace of recovery from Hurricane Katrina at a hearing in the French Quarter, criticizing federal officials for perceived inequities in aid to Louisiana and for imposing rules that are halting government assistance.,With ,, Democrat of Illinois and a presidential candidate, expected to speak at the hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, dozens of residents lined up outside the Louisiana Supreme Court building hoping to be admitted. But only a small fraction were allowed inside, where Mr. Obama jousted with Donald E. Powell, the federal coordinator of Gulf Coast rebuilding, about where the money was, and why more of it was not in Louisiana.,Mr. Obama and Senator ,, Democrat of Louisiana, focused on why Louisiana, which had far more damage than Mississippi, did not receive a larger proportion of federal aid. Mr. Powell said Congress had put a cap on how much aid money any one state could get.,The senators complained about federal rules requiring a local match for aid after disasters; Mr. Powell said that in some cases, like the removal of the tons of debris that inundated the landscape here, the rules had been waived.,The senators, including the panelâ€™s chairman, ,, independent of Connecticut, voiced little criticism of Mayor C. Ray Nagin or other local officials, and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana was not on the witness list. Ms. Blanco is responsible for the Road Home, a troubled housing assistance program that has made little progress in getting federal rebuilding aid to thousands of homeowners.,Fewer than 300 homeowners have received aid under the program, Mr. Lieberman said, though more than 100,000 have applied. (A program official said on Monday that 359 had received grants.) The programâ€™s failure is cited as a crucial reason for the faltering repopulation effort.,The senators used the occasion to echo local laments that President Bush did not mention New Orleans in his State of the Union address. They did not disagree when Mr. Nagin, evidently referring to officials outside the city, said, â€œThe tragedy of Katrina has lingered for so long, I just donâ€™t see the will to really fix it.â€ù,While the senators scored the federal response, Mr. Powell gingerly noted the regionâ€™s â€œsignificantâ€ù difficulties before the storm, and suggested the problems of the Road Home were now a state matter.,Undeterred, Mr. Obama warmed to the issue of the Bush administrationâ€™s failures in the response to the disaster, now a fixture in the Democratsâ€™ arsenal.,â€œThereâ€™s not a sense of urgency out of this White House to get this done,â€ù Mr. Obama said. He spoke of his hometown of Chicagoâ€™s recovery from the great fire of 1871 as an effort of national will, and suggested it could be done again.,Mr. Obama wondered about â€œwhether weâ€™re in danger of actually forgetting New Orleans,â€ù adding, â€œThatâ€™s shameful.â€ù",ADAM NOSSITER,"JAN. 30, 2007",Senators at Louisiana Hearing Criticize Federal Recovery Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/us/30katrina.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"THE commercials are rambling musings by the comedian Demetri Martin that seem to have little to do with the product, Microsoftâ€™s new Windows Vista operating system.,Yet Microsoft is tickled with its campaign featuring Mr. Martin. And the same goes for Nissan, which hired a little-known comic to live in a Sentra last fall and blog about it. And for Pepsi, which is in its third year of featuring a changing cast of comedians  â€”  many unfamiliar to the general public  â€” in its commercials and on a Web site for its Sierra Mist lemon-lime soft drink.,And then thereâ€™s the pitchman for the Apple Macintosh, John Hodgman, the author and humorist  previously best known for a computer column on the Web site of the literary journal McSweeneyâ€™s.,Call them emerging talents or just offbeat characters. Whatever the description, marketers are turning to unusual, often little-known personalities who offer the kind of novelty and freshness that young people might blog about, link to and comment on in chats: in other words, make viral on the Internet.,Compared with Jay Leno, whose mass celebrity Microsoft tapped at the news conference introducing its Windows 95 operating system, Demetri Martin is not exactly a household name. And thatâ€™s exactly the point, said Tommy Means, co-founder of Mekanism, the San Francisco agency  hired to create a campaign aimed at the 18- to 30-year-olds who populate online communities.,â€œThis audience is highly influential,â€ù said Mr. Means. â€œThe general population take their cues from what the online buzz is discovering.â€ù,Along with Microsoftâ€™s ad agency, McCann Erickson, a unit of the Interpublic Group, Mr. Martin and Mekanism developed a Web site (,) that offers a series of â€œwebisodes,â€ù or stories told in short video clips. Microsoft also sponsored a performance tour for Mr. Martin and his Comedy Central special, which was shown last night.  The agencies produced commercials specifically for that TV special.,â€œWe wanted something very special for this audience; something very low key,â€ù said Brian Marr, Microsoft group marketing manager for Windows Vista. â€œThis is an audience that is very cautious about marketing.â€ù,Microsoft liked Mr. Martinâ€™s in-the-know humor, but was also drawn to his built-in digital audience. His  page on MySpace.com lists more than 80,000 friends.,News of the clearification.com site was released  in e-mail messages to influential blogs like , and on video sites like ,. The site also lets visitors sign up for an alert to notify them  when the latest webisode is released.,There is no direct pitch for Microsoft or Windows Vista on the site, but there is, as it turns out, a connection between Mr. Martinâ€™s meandering commercials and Windows Vista.,â€œWindows Vistaâ€™s brand promise is that itâ€™s easier; it brings clarity to life. He took that idea and made a very funny series,â€ù Mr. Marr said. â€œHereâ€™s a guy who is cluttered in his life and finds clarity. Thatâ€™s the whole idea of clearification.â€ù,Mr. Marr said the campaign with Mr. Martin was not related to the media blitz Microsoft plans for the introduction of Windows Vista today, but played an important role in linking the brand to influential people.,Nissan North America used the idea of hiring a little-known comedian, Marc Horowitz, to live in a 2007 Sentra for a week and blog about it to underscore its advertising theme: â€œThe next generation Sentra. You could pretty much live in it.â€ù,The idea was to get mentioned in Web conversations, and the metrics show it worked, said Stephen Kerho, Nissanâ€™s director of interactive marketing and media. Mr. Horowitzâ€™s exploits were tracked on more than 270 message boards, for example, and video clips of his antics were viewed 50,000 times during the first four weeks after its introduction last fall. Visits to the corporate Web site that originated in its Sentra section doubled in the last quarter.,â€œIt had an extremely high level of engagement, that you canâ€™t get in a 30-second spot alone,â€ù Mr. Kerho said. â€œItâ€™s a great model for us for other campaigns.â€ù,Thatâ€™s not to say 30-second spots are dead. Sierra Mistâ€™s campaign, which includes a troupe of lesser-known comedians, has been blogged about and  chatted about as well. Among its popular spots was one set at an airport,  with Kathy Griffin,  the comedian and actress, as a security official who makes funny noises with her mouth every time her wand gets near a Sierra Mist bottle.,â€œAt the heart and soul, the chemistry was the key,â€ù said Bill Bruce, chief creative officer at BBDO New York. â€œThe goal was to create little 30-second TV shows, if you will, to try to change the paradigm of commercial interruption. The idea is that these are episodes.â€ù,Still, with all these new faces, is the era of celebrity advertising waning? Sierra Mistâ€™s maker, Pepsi, whose ads have featured BeyoncÃ© Knowles and Britney Spears among others, thinks not.,â€œI absolutely do not think the celebrity era of advertising is gone; consumers remain fascinated with celebrities,â€ù said Frank Cooper, vice president of marketing for flavored carbonated drinks at Pepsi. â€œWhat there isnâ€™t is a blanket rule.

"HARARE, ,, Jan. 29 (Reuters) â€” A handful of army doctors struggled to cope with emergencies at Zimbabweâ€™s largest public hospital on Monday as regular doctors pressed on with a five-week-old strike that has all but paralyzed public medical care.,Officials said there were about seven members of the army medical corps at Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare, the capital, trying to do a job usually done by more than 120 doctors.,â€œWe are very stretched at the moment,â€ù a hospital official said. â€œBut we keep hoping that a resolution to this problem will be found soon for the good of the patients.â€ù,The government called for help from the army this month after doctors walked off the job to protest their pay levels, which they say have been eroded by galloping inflation that is attributed to President Robert Mugabeâ€™s policies.,Junior doctors at state hospitals now earn the equivalent of $950 a month at the official exchange rate, but less than $50 at black market rates.

"EAST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 29 â€” To say Emma Faust Tillman lived a full life would be an epic understatement.,She was one of 23 children born to former slaves in North Carolina, and one of only 15 who lived to adulthood. She was the first black student to graduate from Glastonbury High School, just a few miles south of here, and voted in the first election in which women were allowed to do so. Discrimination prevented her finding a job as a secretary, so she began catering, eventually baking cakes for Katharine Hepburnâ€™s father and Jackie Robinson.,Mrs. Tillman, who died Sunday, was known as the â€œmotherâ€ù of the Metropolitan A.M.E. Zion Church in Hartford, where she sang in the choir for more than 70 years.,And last Wednesday she was declared the oldest person in the world, at 114 years, 63 days and counting.,Whether she ever knew she received the title is unclear. When the television news cameras crowded into the lobby of her nursing home here, Mrs. Tillman acknowledged them but was unable to speak, her head hanging down, a blank look on her face.,By the time they left, she was exhausted and returned to the bedroom she moved to in 2003, after decades of living independently. She went to sleep and never woke up again.,The title of â€œworldâ€™s oldest personâ€ù is now apparently passed to Yone Minagawa of Japan, who was born within weeks of Mrs. Tillman and turned 114 this month.,And though it is perhaps impolite to mention, recent history suggests that Ms. Minagawa may not hold the crown for long. In the last month alone, the title of oldest person has changed hands three times, according to the Gerontology Research Group, an authority on the matter.,â€œThe Guinness Book of World Records will not be able to keep up,â€ù said Dr. L. Stephen Coles of the University of California, Los Angeles, the executive director of the group. â€œThis has been a pretty volatile time. Usually weâ€™ve had a more stable No. 1 position.â€ù,On average, Dr. Coles said, the â€œoldest personâ€ù retains the title for about eight months. But since August, there have been five. Dr. Coles said that this was nothing more than a statistical anomaly.,Even among those who age gracefully, few live long enough to become supercentenarians, the term given to those older than 110. With the death of Mrs. Tillman, the gerontology group has records of 84 such people in the world: 6 men and 78 women.,Dr. Coles acknowledged, though, that it is likely that the list, which relies on notification from relatives or neighbors, vastly underestimates the number.,For those who are known to be in that select circle, life as a very old person can become quite a public affair. Mrs. Tillman, for her part, did not shy away from the attention, happy to take in the birthday parties for her at the convalescent home.,On her 113th birthday in 2005, Mrs. Tillman received 113 long-stem red roses from a much younger man â€” Donald Pitkin, a member of the East Hartford Town Council, who at the time was 84. â€œMy, my, what a lot of beautiful flowers,â€ù those who were present recall her saying. â€œIt makes a woman think she might want to get married again.â€ù,Mrs. Tillmanâ€™s husband died in 1939, before the United States entered World War II. She outlived countless other relatives, including one of her two daughters. But of the four siblings who moved north with Mrs. Tillman at the turn of the 20th century, all lived past age 100.,There is no consensus on what allows certain people to live so long,  but there is wide agreement that good genes are the best predictor of a long life. It probably helped, too, that Mrs. Tillman neither smoked nor drank.,She also did not drive. But with the exception of relying on others for rides, Mrs. Tillman lived quite independently. After first voting in 1920, she cast a ballot in every election until 2006. She attended church weekly until her 114th birthday, on Nov. 22.,That day, Mrs. Tillman was quite subdued, but she perked up when the choir sang two of her favorite songs, â€œIn the Gardenâ€ù and â€œPassing Through,â€ù said John Stewart Jr., one of her great-nephews, who attended the service with her.,It was the last time Mrs. Tillman would leave her home, he said. He recalled her remarking on the milestone: â€œIâ€™m 114. Itâ€™s enough now,â€ù she said. â€œIâ€™ll go whenever the man upstairs calls me home.â€ù,Mrs. Tillman is survived by her 80-year-old daughter, Majorie. But the large extended family is something of a complicated clan: the funeral program will list 7 grandchildren, 36 great-grandchildren, 16 great-great-grandchildren and 16 great-great-great-grandchildren.,â€œShe was the glue that held us all together,â€ù said Mr. Stewart, the family historian and a former chief of the Hartford Fire Department â€” the first African-American fire chief in New England. â€œShe has served the good Lord, she has served the church, she has served us. What better legacy can she leave?â€ù,Once it became clear on Friday that Mrs. Tillman was entering her final days, family members filed into her room. They quickly decided they would not attach her to a feeding tube or other machines, preferring to let her die in what doctors said would be a matter of days.,By Sunday evening, Mr. Stewart said, she looked as though she had more color in her face, and a smile seemed to have appeared on her lips.",JENNIFER MEDINA,"JAN. 30, 2007","In Connecticut, Worldâ€™s Oldest Woman Dies at 114",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/nyregion/30old.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
", the president of New Yorkâ€™s largest health care union, announced yesterday that he would step down, but not without issuing a surprisingly pointed broadside against Gov. ,â€™s planned cuts in health care spending.,In 17 years as president of 1199 S.E.I.U., the stateâ€™s most politically powerful union, Mr. Rivera has been perhaps the most formidable and visible labor leader in New York politics.,He announced that he was leaving his post to become chairman of a new one-million-member national health care union being established within his localâ€™s parent, the ,. Mr. Rivera said the new organization would help unionize more health care workers and make the service employees a more potent political force, especially in the push for universal health coverage.,Mr. Rivera, whose Manhattan-based local has nearly 300,000 members, said he would step down on June 15, when his term ends. He added that he was not leaving sooner because he wanted to protect his members and the stateâ€™s hospitals from the cuts that Mr. Spitzer was expected to propose tomorrow.,Mr. Rivera, 56, often tangled â€” most times successfully â€” with Govs. Mario M. Cuomo and George E. Pataki to fight health care cuts. But now he sees a major fight looming with Mr. Spitzer after the new governor warned last Friday that health care spending must reflect the patientsâ€™ needs and not politics and entrenched interests â€” a statement that Mr. Rivera interpreted as an attack on 1199.,â€œI donâ€™t think the patients in , and our health care institutions are served by basically identifying us as villains because we are the ones who give health care to patients every day,â€ù Mr. Rivera said. â€œWe donâ€™t want to have a war with Eliot Spitzer. We donâ€™t believe in having a war with anybody. We believe in having a constructive dialogue. But on the other hand, weâ€™re not going to be a punching bag for anybody.â€ù,The remarks were particularly candid for a leader whose union has largely refrained from taking on Mr. Spitzer directly since his landslide election victory. But Mr. Rivera warned that his union might sponsor a campaign of newspaper ads and commercials against Mr. Spitzer and his proposed cuts. When 1199 undertook a campaign in 1996 against cutbacks proposed by Mr. Pataki, the governorâ€™s popularity ratings plunged and he eventually relented. Later, Mr. Rivera and Mr. Pataki became allies, and in 2002, 1199 endorsed Mr. Pataki, a Republican, for re-election.,In a speech last Friday, Mr. Spitzer said he would seek billions of dollars in Medicaid and other health care savings when he unveils his budget tomorrow. He specifically criticized a deal that Mr. Pataki struck with 1199 in 2002 that provided some $2 billion in additional health care spending, much of it for raises for the unionâ€™s members.,â€œThe problem,â€ù Mr. Spitzer said, â€œis a system â€” co-opted by entrenched interests â€” that resists making hard choices to change the status quo.â€ù,Mr. Rivera said that it was â€œsad and unfortunate that while Democratic governors across the nation are expanding health care access and proposing universal health care, Mr. Spitzer has taken a different posture that is more consistent with right-wing Republicans.â€ù,The new union, S.E.I.U. Healthcare, will combine more than 30 locals across the country and will seek to set nationwide standards for health care workers and do more lobbying in state capitals and in Washington on behalf of those workers.,Sounding exhilarated about his new job, Mr. Rivera said he saw opportunities to double the number of health care workers who are unionized. He outlined plans to have the service employeesâ€™ new union create a political action committee that would have a budget of $40 million every two years, making it one of the nationâ€™s largest PACâ€™s.,â€œIt is a time of enormous opportunity,â€ù Mr. Rivera said. â€œI believe we can obtain in the next two years, certainly with a new Congress and president, universal health coverage in the United States.â€ù,In his new position, Mr. Rivera will be one of the front-runners to succeed Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union. Mr. Rivera said that his strategy as head of S.E.I.U. Healthcare would be similar to his strategy in New York State: form alliances with hospitals and health executives to fight against cuts and fight for broader and better coverage.,In New York, 1199 often joined the Greater New York Hospital Association to push for major changes, like the creation of Family Health Plus to provide health insurance to more low-income children.,â€œThe way we look at it, Dennis is not stepping down, heâ€™s stepping up,â€ù said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the hospital association. â€œHeâ€™s looking for a platform that can amplify the kind of significant work that he has done in New York.â€ù,When Mr. Rivera, a former union organizer in his native Puerto Rico, became 1199â€™s president in 1989, it had 78,000 members and was bitterly divided.  Sometimes the police intervened to prevent the factions from fighting. Now, 1199 is solidly united and nearly four times as large, having unionized tens of thousands of workers and merged with more than a dozen locals.,If the state budget is completed early, allowing him to step down before June 15, Mr. Rivera will be succeeded by George Gresham, 1199â€™s secretary-treasurer. Mr. Gresham, 51, who joined 1199 as a custodian at Presbyterian Hospital, plans to run for the presidency.,Mr. Rivera said 1199 had shown its willingness to compromise by agreeing to the hospital closings and other cuts that a special state panel, known as the Berger Commission, proposed in November. â€œThe Berger Commission will impact more than 15,000 health care workers in New York State and more than 57 institutions,â€ù he said. â€œFor Eliot Spitzer to do more cuts on top of that is outrageous.â€ù,Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, an affiliate of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, said he was happy that Mr. Rivera was moving on.,â€œIf you want to get an idea of how important Dennis Rivera is, much of what Governor Spitzer has to do this year is to undo what Rivera accomplished with Governor Pataki and the Legislature,â€ù he said. â€œDepending on your perspective, he did a lot or he did too much. Heâ€™s casting a long shadow.â€ù,Mr. Rivera has clashed with Mr. Spitzer by endorsing the Republican candidate in the race for an open State Senate seat on Long Island. Mr. Rivera is close to Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, who is a Republican and has often helped 1199 by blocking health care cuts.,Mr. Rivera, whose union normally gives more than 90 percent of its political money to Democrats, said it was important to back the Republicans, who narrowly control the Senate, â€œbecause we believe that checks and balances are important at this very difficult moment.â€ù",STEVEN GREENHOUSE,"JAN. 30, 2007","Labor Leader Is Parting, With a Shot",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/nyregion/30labor.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 1975, after  the oil embargo, Congress approved the most successful energy-saving measure this country has ever seen: the Corporate Average Fuel Economy system, known as CAFE, which set minimum mileage standards for cars. Within 10 years, automobile efficiency had virtually doubled, to 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 from just over 14 miles per gallon in 1976.,The mileage standards are still 27.5 m.p.g. Except for minor tweaks, Congress has refused to raise fuel efficiency requirements or close a gaping loophole that lets S.U.V.â€™s and pickups be measured by a more lenient standard.,Americans who heard President Bushâ€™s State of the Union address, including his pledge to reduce Americaâ€™s gasoline consumption, can be forgiven for thinking he was finally ready to change that. But all Mr. Bush really asked for was the authority to set mileage standards in a different way. Rather than requiring companies to meet an average fuel-efficiency standard, balancing gas savers against gas guzzlers, he would assign targets model by model, based on factors like size and weight.,As for what those new targets might be, Mr. Bush would leave it to his secretary of transportation to decide. And he asked the country to take it on faith that this new measurement system, combined with technological advances, would lead to annual mileage improvements of 4 percent a year.,Our fear is that this program will take far too long to get going, if it gets going at all. Like Congress, the Transportation Department has been notoriously solicitous of the automobile industry.,But thereâ€™s a way Congress can get moving. Senator Barack Obama plans to reintroduce a bill that would set a 4 percent annual increase in efficiency as a target, just what Mr. Bush says he wants. The bill would also give both the Transportation Department and the manufacturers considerable flexibility. But the department could not deviate from the target unless it could demonstrate that the costs outweighed the benefits.,Even that is too much wiggle room for lawmakers like Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Edward Markey. While allowing for administrative flexibility, they would require a firm fleetwide standard of 35 m.p.g. with no escape hatches. But given the long Congressional stalemate, the Obama bill could be an important first step. It commands some bipartisan support, and unlike Mr. Bushâ€™s approach, it promises real as opposed to hypothetical results.",,"JAN. 30, 2007",A Faith-Based Fuel Initiative,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/opinion/30tue1.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 â€” President Bush has signed a directive that gives the White House much greater control over the rules and policy statements that the government develops to protect public health, safety, the environment, civil rights and privacy.,In an executive order published last week in the Federal Register, Mr. Bush said that each agency must have a regulatory policy office run by a political appointee, to supervise the development of rules and documents providing guidance to regulated industries. The White House will thus have a gatekeeper in each agency to analyze the costs and the benefits of new rules and to make sure the agencies carry out the presidentâ€™s priorities.,This strengthens the hand of the White House in shaping rules that have, in the past, often been generated by civil servants and scientific experts. It suggests that the administration still has ways to exert its power after the takeover of Congress by the Democrats.,The White House said the executive order was not meant to rein in any one agency. But business executives and consumer advocates said the administration was particularly concerned about rules and guidance issued by the , and the ,.,In an interview on Monday, Jeffrey A. Rosen, general counsel at the White House ,, said, â€œThis is a classic good-government measure that will make federal agencies more open and accountable.â€ù,Business groups welcomed the executive order, saying it had the potential to reduce what they saw as the burden of federal regulations. This burden is of great concern to many groups, including small businesses, that have given strong political and financial backing to Mr. Bush.,Consumer, labor and environmental groups denounced the executive order, saying it gave too much control to the White House and would hinder agenciesâ€™ efforts to protect the public.,Typically, agencies issue regulations under authority granted to them in laws enacted by Congress. In many cases, the statute does not say precisely what agencies should do, giving them considerable latitude in interpreting the law and developing regulations.,The directive issued by Mr. Bush says that, in deciding whether to issue regulations, federal agencies must identify â€œthe specific market failureâ€ù or problem that justifies government intervention.,Besides placing political appointees in charge of rule making, Mr. Bush said agencies must give the White House an opportunity to review â€œany significant guidance documentsâ€ù before they are issued.,The Office of Management and Budget already has an elaborate process for the review of proposed rules. But in recent years, many agencies have circumvented this process by issuing guidance documents, which explain how they will enforce federal laws and contractual requirements.,Peter L. Strauss, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the executive order â€œachieves a major increase in White House control over domestic government.â€ù,â€œHaving lost control of Congress,â€ù Mr. Strauss said, â€œthe president is doing what he can to increase his control of the executive branch.â€ù,Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said: â€œThe executive order allows the political staff at the White House to dictate decisions on health and safety issues, even if the governmentâ€™s own impartial experts disagree. This is a terrible way to govern, but great news for special interests.â€ù,Business groups hailed the initiative.,â€œThis is the most serious attempt by any chief executive to get control over the regulatory process, which spews out thousands of regulations a year,â€ù said William L. Kovacs, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. â€œBecause of the executive order, regulations will be less onerous and more reasonable. Federal officials will have to pay more attention to the costs imposed on business, state and local governments, and society.â€ù,Under the executive order, each federal agency must estimate â€œthe combined aggregate costs and benefits of all its regulationsâ€ù each year. Until now, agencies often tallied the costs and the benefits of major rules one by one, without measuring the cumulative effects.,Gary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a liberal-leaning consumer group that monitors the Office of Management and Budget, criticized Mr. Bushâ€™s order, saying, â€œIt will result in more delay and more White House control over the day-to-day work of federal agencies.â€ù,â€œBy requiring agencies to show a â€˜market failure,â€™ â€ù Dr. Bass said, â€œPresident Bush has created another hurdle for agencies to clear before they can issue rules protecting public health and safety.â€ù,Wesley P. Warren, program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who worked at the White House for seven years under President Bill Clinton, said, â€œThe executive order is a backdoor attempt to prevent E.P.A. from being able to enforce environmental safeguards that keep cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants out of the air and water.â€ù,Business groups have complained about the proliferation of guidance documents. David W. Beier, a senior vice president of Amgen, the biotechnology company, said Medicare officials had issued such documents â€œwith little or no public input.â€ù,Hugh M. Oâ€™Neill, a vice president of the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, said guidance documents sometimes undermined or negated the effects of formal regulations.,In theory, guidance documents do not have the force of law. But the White House said the documents needed closer scrutiny because they â€œcan have coercive effectsâ€ù and â€œcan impose significant costsâ€ù on the public. Many guidance documents are made available to regulated industries but not to the public.,Paul R. Noe, who worked on regulatory policy at the White House from 2001 to 2006, said such aberrations would soon end. â€œIn the past, guidance documents were often issued in the dark,â€ù Mr. Noe said. â€œThe executive order will ensure they are issued in the sunshine, with more opportunity for public comment.â€ù,Under the new White House policy, any guidance document expected to have an economic effect of $100 million a year or more must be posted on the Internet, and agencies must invite public comment, except in emergencies in which the White House grants an exemption.,The White House told agencies that in writing guidance documents, they could not impose new legal obligations on anyone and could not use â€œmandatory language such as â€˜shall,â€™ â€˜must,â€™ â€˜requiredâ€™ or â€˜requirement.â€™ â€ù,The executive order was issued as White House aides were preparing for a battle over the nomination of Susan E. Dudley to be administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget.,President Bush first nominated Ms. Dudley last August. The nomination died in the Senate, under a barrage of criticism from environmental and consumer groups, which said she had been hostile to government regulation. Mr. Bush nominated her again on Jan. 9.,With Democrats in control, the Senate appears unlikely to confirm Ms. Dudley. But under the Constitution, the president could appoint her while the Senate is in recess, allowing her to serve through next year.,Some of Ms. Dudleyâ€™s views are reflected in the executive order. In a primer on regulation written in 2005, while she was at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University in Northern Virginia, Ms. Dudley said that government regulation was generally not warranted â€œin the absence of a significant market failure.â€ù,She did not return calls seeking comment on Monday.",ROBERT PEAR,"JAN. 30, 2007",Bush Directive Increases Sway on Regulation,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/washington/30rules.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Microsoftâ€™s power in the technology industry, some analysts insist, is waning. It faces a host of rivals from a reinvigorated Apple on the desktop to Web-based challengers like Google, delivering services and software online.,But yesterday, on the eve of the arrival of new models of Microsoftâ€™s flagship products, the Windows operating system and the Office programs, the skeptics were overshadowed and drowned out by the opening salvos in the software giantâ€™s marketing campaign.,Windows Vista and Office 2007 start appearing today, available in retail stores as a shrink-wrapped package and shipped on new machines sold by personal computer makers. The new Microsoft offerings were available to large corporate customers at the end of November.,Steven A. Ballmer, the companyâ€™s chief executive, called today â€œthe biggest product launch in Microsoftâ€™s history,â€ù and the rollout will be backed by a first-year marketing budget of hundreds of millions of dollars.,New versions of Windows and Office move across the technology industry like a powerful weather system, driving sales of personal computers and other hardware, software and services. The pace is typically gradual but steady, yet the impact on the rest of the industry is significant.,Over 5,000 software and hardware products are ready to run on Vista, and Microsoft has more than 500,000 industry partners worldwide, including resellers, retailers and consultants as well as hardware and software companies. Millions of developers write programs that run on Windows.,For every dollar Microsoft makes on Windows Vista, the rest of the industry will collect $18 of revenue, estimates IDC, a technology research firm. Indeed, those that build products and services on top of and around Microsoftâ€™s technology constitute  an industry ecosystem that business professors have studied. And Microsoftâ€™s long investment in nurturing that network of mutual support, they say, is a major reason that Windows holds more than 90 percent of the market for PC operating systems.,In the United States, the IDC report concluded, â€œthis ecosystem should sell about $70 billion in products and services revolving around Windows Vistaâ€ù in 2007. The introduction of Windows Vista, IDC projected, is expected to generate 157,000 jobs in the United States. The IDC study was paid for by Microsoft, but the research firm said it used its own methodology.,Because the universe of Windows users has grown, Mr. Ballmer predicted that sales of Windows Vista in the first three months would be five times the early sales of Windows 95, introduced in 1995, and double the sales of Windows XP, shipped in 2001.,Mr. Ballmer spoke at a news conference in New York, along with executives from large computer manufacturers and chip makers. â€œI hope your forecasts are right,â€ù said Todd Bradley, executive vice president for personal computers at Hewlett-Packard. â€œWeâ€™d all be thrilled.â€ù,The industry has certainly been patient. Vista suffered repeated delays, coming five years after Windows XP. Microsoft has vowed that there will never again be so lengthy a gap between versions of its operating system. Industry analysts expect that Microsoft will more regularly update Windows with new features and bug fixes delivered over the Internet â€” and that the line between the desktop software and Internet software will increasingly blur.,â€œToday will go down in computing history as the last big operating system launch for Microsoft,â€ù said Gary Beach, publisher of CIO Magazine, a publication for professional technology managers.,For those upgrading from previous versions of Windows, there are three versions of Vista, from $100 to $260. The new operating system has striking three-dimensional graphics, an easier-to-use interface and improved security, and it handles games, music, video and pictures far better than previous generations of Windows, most product reviewers have agreed. But many reviewers have also pointed out that most of the new features in Vista are already in Appleâ€™s Macintosh computers.,Mr. Ballmer and Bill Gates, the chairman, presided over a gathering in a Times Square theater to celebrate Vistaâ€™s arrival, along with  industry partners, analysts, and early Vista users, or beta testers. One was Farage Yusupov, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Some Vista features, he said, did not run on his two-year-old laptop.,But Mr. Yusupov said he planned to get a new computer with Vista soon. â€œIn a year or two, every computer is going to have it,â€ù he said. â€œSince Iâ€™m going to get it sooner or later, I want it sooner.â€ù,Microsoftâ€™s industry partners described Vista as a watershed. Hector Ruiz, the chairman of Advanced Micro Devices, a microprocessor maker, said the new Microsoft operating system would usher in â€œthe visualization age of computingâ€ù with rich 3-D graphics entering the mainstream. â€œAnd stunning visual experiences require outstanding hardware,â€ù Mr. Ruiz added.,Kevin B. Rollins, Dellâ€™s chief executive, said his company began taking orders online over the weekend for Vista-equipped machines. Traffic on the companyâ€™s Web site increased 20 percent because of demand for PCâ€™s running Vista, and tens of thousands of them have been sold in the last couple of days, Mr. Rollins said.,Sean Maloney, executive vice president of Intel, said that Vistaâ€™s abilities combined with rapidly advancing technology in microchips would lead to a â€œgolden age for PCs,â€ù allowing them to serve as a central hub for storing, managing and sending digital media like movies and music to television sets and music players in the home.,In an interview, Mr. Bradley of Hewlett-Packard pointed to his companyâ€™s TouchSmart PC, being released to coincide with Vistaâ€™s debut, to show that manufacturers are increasingly able to use Microsoftâ€™s operating system as â€œa platform we can build around instead of just embed on our machines.â€ù,The $1,699 model, with a 20-inch touch screen and television tuner built in, has a user interface that has been tailored by Hewlett-Packard engineers so that it looks different from a standard Windows machine. Microsoftâ€™s antitrust settlement with the federal government required the software maker to give PC makers more freedom to modify Windows.,Most of Microsoftâ€™s vast marketing budget will be on print, television, radio and Web advertisements. But some will go for so-called viral marketing events like an online puzzle contest called Vanishing Point, sponsored by Microsoft and A.M.D. The winner will get a ride into space from a private space travel company.,The strategy, said Michael Sievert, vice president for Windows marketing, â€œis really about getting people to come in and have a look.â€ù",STEVE LOHR,"JAN. 30, 2007",First the Wait for Microsoft Vista; Now the Marketing Barrage,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/technology/30soft.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Listening to friends complain about their contractors is a familiar trial of New York living. But how many can claim to have heard a bona fide genius hold forth on this riveting topic?,Nowâ€™s your chance. In â€œFrankâ€™s Home,â€ù the new play by Richard Nelson that opened last night at ,, no less an eminence than , can be heard bemoaning at length the dubious practices of a builder who botched the construction of one of his houses. For what seems like a full half-hour of Mr. Nelsonâ€™s play, Wright denounces this cretinous contractor and his outrages while another architectural eminence, Louis Sullivan, Wrightâ€™s former mentor, looks on wearily.,Occasionally, Sullivan interrupts Wrightâ€™s screed to offer the same distracted murmurs of sympathy New Yorkers are called upon to provide when friends and relatives get going on the agonies of their full-scale bathroom renovations.,This tedious speech may be the low point of Mr. Nelsonâ€™s dreary drama, which travels a worn path in the bioplay genre, lingering lovingly as it does on its subjectâ€™s feet of clay while paying occasional lip service to his artistic divinity. But then, highlights are few in this sloppily constructed work, which carefully parcels out plenty of facts but never manages to achieve the ring of truth.,Peter Weller plays the genius/louse, whom Mr. Nelson intercepts at a low ebb in his professional career. It is 1923, and Wright has relocated to California, where he hopes to revive his flagging fortunes with a couple of small commissions. He is reunited there with his  adult children Catherine (Maggie Siff) and Lloyd (Jay Whittaker), whom he had abandoned many years before when he left their mother, who has just recently granted him a divorce.,His current companion, Miriam Noel (Mary Beth Fisher), may be matrimonially inclined, but itâ€™s hard to tell, as sheâ€™s both a drunk and a crackpot. Also on hand for this tension-riddled family reunion is Sullivan (,), likewise booze-sodden after the death of his lover and hoping to cadge some work from his former protÃ©gÃ©.,The quasi-Chekhovian setup finds these characters and a few others lolling about, nursing old wounds and inflicting new ones, on a patch of ground in the Hollywood Hills, where Wright is working on a schoolhouse commission for an idealistic young teacher, Helen Girvin (Holley Fain). Mr. Nelsonâ€™s point of view on his subject accords with the standard assessment of him as a great artist who never quite made the grade as a human being. As Wright himself rather baldly puts it when, having been handed a sketch pad, he is asked if heâ€™s drawing the comely young Helen, who sits adoringly at his feet: â€œIâ€™m not good with people. Iâ€™m drawing a building.â€ù,Illustrating Wrightâ€™s lordly detachment from his ostensible loved ones takes up much of the playâ€™s running time of one and three-quarter hours, with no intermission. Wright belittles Lloyd with a bland viciousness and responds with indifference to Catherineâ€™s rather bizarre fluctuations between giddy worship and peevish cracks about being neglected.,The hysteria of Miriam, who blows in and out of the play in a storm of neuroses, doesnâ€™t get much of a rise out of him either, although the two occasionally can be heard flaying each other with abuse from offstage. Only toward his colleague Sullivan does Wright evince some sympathy, although it is late in coming and apparently doesnâ€™t extend to giving him a job.,Mr. Wellerâ€™s coolly imperious performance is in keeping with Mr. Nelsonâ€™s vision of Wright as a man who poured his heart into his work and had little love left over to distribute among his family members. Unfortunately, Mr. Weller canâ€™t generate much heat from the speeches in which Wright pontificates about the necessity of beauty and the moral purposes of great architecture, which sound generic and pompous.,â€œBeauty, son,â€ù he lectures Lloyd. â€œItâ€™s not just a decoration, a painted face. Itâ€™s our life and death. Our reason. Our meaning. And what we are â€” as human beings.â€ù,The other roles in the play are even less rewarding, so it is hardly fair to blame the actors for the dimensionless performances. Nor should Robert Falls, the estimable artistic director of the Goodman Theater in Chicago, where the play had its premiere in the fall, be taken to task for the generally flaccid staging. Itâ€™s hard to do much with a play so unrelentingly dour and lacking in either thematic or narrative shape, although it would have been nice if Mr. Falls could have found a way to provide visual proof of Wrightâ€™s artistry, rather than merely have people chat about it.,A slide show might not be the most theatrically vital answer, but at least the images of Wrightâ€™s masterly architectural achievements would give us some minor aesthetic reward for enduring Mr. Nelsonâ€™s ill-conceived play.,By Richard Nelson; directed by Robert Falls; sets by Thomas Lynch; costumes by Susan Hilferty; lighting by Michael Philippi; original music and sound by Richard Woodbury; production manager, Christopher Boll; production stage manager, Barclay Stiff.

"Microsoft says its new operating system, Windows Vista, is the most secure in the companyâ€™s history. Now the bounty hunters will test just how secure it is.,When its predecessor, Windows XP, was released five years ago, software bugs were typically hunted by hackers for fame and glory, not financial reward. But now software vulnerabilities â€” as with stolen credit-card numbers and spammable e-mail addresses â€” carry real financial value. They  are commonly bought, sold and traded online, both by legitimate security companies, which say they are providing a service, and by nefarious hackers and thieves.,Vista, which will be installed on millions of new PCs starting today, provides the latest target.,This month, iDefense Labs, a subsidiary of the technology company VeriSign, said it was offering $8,000 for the first six researchers to find holes in Vista, and $4,000 more for the so-called exploit, the program needed to  take advantage of the weakness.,IDefense sells such information to corporations and government agencies, which have already begun using Vista, so they can protect their own systems.,Companies like Microsoft do not endorse such bounty programs, but they have even bigger problems: the willingness of Internet criminals to spend large sums for early knowledge of software flaws that could provide an opening for identity-theft schemes and spam attacks.,The Japanese security firm Trend Micro said in December that it had found a Vista flaw for sale on a Romanian Web forum for $50,000. Security experts say that the price is plausible, and that they regularly see hackers on public bulletin boards or private online chat rooms trying to sell the holes they have discovered, and the coding to exploit them.,Especially prized are so-called zero-day exploits, bits of disruption coding that spread immediately because there is no known defense.,Software vendors have traditionally asked security researchers to alert them first when they find bugs in their software, so that they could issue a fix, or patch, and protect the general public. But now researchers contend that their time and effort are worth much more.,â€œTo find a vulnerability, you have to do a lot of hard work,â€ù said Evgeny Legerov, founder of a small security firm, Gleg Ltd., in Moscow.  â€œIf you follow what they call responsible disclosure, in most cases all you receive is an ordinary thank you or sometimes nothing at all.â€ù,Gleg sells vulnerability research to a dozen corporate customers around the world, with fees starting at $10,000 for periodic updates. Mr. Legerov says he regularly turns down the criminals who send e-mail messages offering big money for bugs they can use to spread malicious programs like spyware.,Misusing such information to attack computers or to aid others in such attacks is illegal, but there appears to be nothing illegal about the act of discovering and selling vulnerabilities. Prices for such software bugs range from a couple of hundred dollars to tens of thousands.,Microsoft is not the only target, of course. Legitimate security researchers and underground hackers look for weaknesses in all commonly used software, including Oracle databases and Appleâ€™s Macintosh operating system. The more popular a program, the higher the  price for an attacking code.,The sales of Vista faults will therefore continue to trail the sale of flaws in more widely used programs, even Windows XP, for the foreseeable future.,â€œOf course it concerns us,â€ù Mark Miller, director of the Microsoft Security Response Center, said of the online bazaar in software flaws, which it has declined to enter. â€œWith the underground trading of vulnerabilities, software makers are left playing catch-up to develop updates that will help protect customers.â€ù,Throughout the 1990s, software makers and bug-hunters battled over the way researchers disclosed software vulnerabilities. The software vendors argued that public disclosure gave attackers the blueprints to create exploitative programs and viruses. Security researchers charged that the vendors wanted to hide their mistakes, and that making them public allowed companies and individual computer users to protect their systems.,The two sides reached an uneasy compromise. Security researchers would inform vendors of vulnerabilities, and as long as the vendor was responsive, wait for the release of an official patch before publishing code that an attacker could use. Vendors would give public credit to the researcher. The dÃ©tente worked when most researchers were motivated by acclaim and a desire to improve security.,But â€œin the last five years the glory seekers have gone away,â€ù said David Perry, global education director at Trend Micro. â€œThe people who are drawn to it to make a living are not the same people who were drawn to it out of passion.â€ù,In 2002, iDefense Labs became one of the first companies to pay for software flaws, offering just a few hundred dollars for a vulnerability. It administered the program quietly for a few years, then answered early critics by arguing that it was getting those bugs out into the open and informing software makers,  at the same time as clients, before announcing them to the general public.,â€œWe give vendors ample time to react, and then we try to responsibly release them,â€ù said Jim Melnick, the director of threat intelligence at iDefense.,In 2005, TippingPoint, a division of the networking giant 3Com, joined iDefense in the nascent marketplace with its â€œZero-Day Initiativeâ€ù program, which last year bought and sold 82 software vulnerabilities. IDefense said its freelance researchers discovered 305  holes in commonly used software during 2006 â€” up from 180 in 2005 â€” and paid $1,000 to $10,000 for each, depending on the severity.,Security researchers warmed to the idea that vulnerabilities were worth real dollars. In December 2005, a hacker calling himself â€œFearwallâ€ù tried to sell on eBay a program to disrupt computers through Excel, Microsoftâ€™s spreadsheet program. Bidding reached a paltry $53 before the auction site pulled it.,Nevertheless, several Internet attacks in the following months exploited flaws in Excel, suggesting to security experts that its creator ultimately found other ways to sell it.,In January 2006, a Moscow-based security company, Kaspersky Labs, found more evidence of an emerging  marketplace for software bugs. Russian hacking gangs, it disclosed at the time, had sold a â€œzero-dayâ€ù program aimed at the Microsoft graphics file format, Windows Metafile or WMF. The price: $4,000.,The program  was widely used that month and allowed criminals to plant spyware and other malicious programs on the computers of tens of thousands of unsuspecting Internet users. Microsoft rushed out a patch.,It had to distribute another patch in September, to counter one more  malicious program, which involved a flaw in the vector graphics engine of Internet Explorer, that enabled further cyber mischief.,Marc Maiffret, co-founder of eEye Digital Security, a computer security company, said prices in the evolving black market quickly proved higher than what legitimate companies would pay. â€œYou will always make more from bad guys than from a company like 3Com,â€ù he said.,Even ethical researchers  feel that companies like  iDefense and TippingPoint do not adequately compensate for the time and effort needed to discover flaws in  complex, relatively secure software.,And some hackers have little ethical compunction about who buys their research, or what they use it for. In a phone interview last week arranged by an intermediary in the security field, a hacker calling himself â€œSegfault,â€ù who said he was a college-age student in New York City, led a reporter on an online tour of a public Web site, ,, where one forum is provocatively titled â€œBuy-Sell-Trade-0day.â€ù,Segfault, who said he did not want to reveal his name because he engages in potentially illegal activity, said the black market for zero-days â€œjust explodedâ€ù last year after the damaging  Windows Metafile attack.,He claims he earned $20,000 last year from selling his own code â€” mostly on private chat channels, not public forums like Ryan1918 â€” making enough to pay his tuition.,Although he conceded that Microsoft had made significant strides with Vistaâ€™s security, he said underground hacker circles now had a powerful financial incentive to find its weak links.,â€œVista is going to get destroyed,â€ù he said.,That may be an exaggeration. Microsoft has taken precautions such as preventing unauthorized   programs from running at the most central part  of the system, called the kernel, and creating an extra level of protection between the operating system and the browser.,Microsoft appears to wish the open market for flaws in their products would simply disappear. â€œOur practice is to explicitly acknowledge and thank researchers when they find an issue in our software,â€ù said Mike Reavey, operations manager of the companyâ€™s security response center. â€œWhile thatâ€™s not a monetary reward, we think there is value in it.â€ù,But independent security analysts say those days are over. Raimund Genes, the Trend Micro researcher who found the Vista bug for sale on a Romanian Web site, said, â€œThe driving force behind all this now is cash.â€ù",BRAD STONE,"JAN. 30, 2007","A Lively Market, Legal and Not, for Software Bugs",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/technology/30bugs.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How often have you left a doctorâ€™s office wondering just what you were told about your health, or what exactly you were supposed to be doing to relieve or prevent a problem? If you are a typical patient, you remember less than half of what your doctor tries to explain.,Whether you left school at 16 or have a doctorate; whether your annual income is in four figures or six; whether you are black, white, Hispanic, Asian or American Indian, chances are there have been many medical encounters that left you with less than optimal understanding about how you can improve or protect your health.,National studies have found that â€œhealth literacyâ€ù is remarkably low, with more than 90 million Americans unable to adequately understand basic health information. The studies show that this obstacle â€œaffects people of all ages, races, income and education levels,â€ù Dr. Richard H. Carmona, the United States surgeon general, wrote in the August issue of The Journal of General Internal Medicine, which was devoted to health literacy.,The fallout is anything but trivial. Researchers have found that poor health literacy, which is especially prevalent among the elderly, results in poor adherence to prescription instructions, infrequent use of preventive medical services, increased hospitalizations and visits to the emergency room and worse control of chronic diseases.,The consequences are poorer health and greater medical costs. All because doctors fail to speak to patients in plain English (or Spanish or Chinese or any other language) and fail to make sure that patients understand what they are told and what they are supposed to do and why.,In a study published in the internal medicine journal, conducted among 2,512 elderly men and women living on their own in Memphis and Pittsburgh, those with limited health literacy were nearly twice as likely to die in a five-year period as were those with adequate health literacy. That held true even when age, race, socioeconomic factors, current health conditions, health care access and health-related behaviors were taken into account.,Another study in the journal among 175 adult , patients treated by Cornell University doctors found that â€œless health literacy was associated with worse quality of life, worse physical function and more emergency department utilization for asthma over two years.â€ù,Among the many problems resulting from limited health literacy are misinterpretations of warning labels on prescription drugs. For example, among 251 adults attending a primary care clinic in Shreveport, La., those with low literacy were three times more likely to misunderstand warnings than the more literate.,When the warning label read â€œDo Not Chew or Crush, Swallow Whole,â€ù misinterpretations included â€œChew it up, so it will dissolveâ€ù and â€œDonâ€™t swallow whole or you might choke.â€ù,When the warning read â€œMedication Should Be Taken With Plenty of Water,â€ù the mistakes included â€œDonâ€™t take when wetâ€ù and â€œDonâ€™t drink hot water.â€ù,When the warning was â€œFor External Use Only,â€ù the mistakes included â€œMedicine will make you feel dizzyâ€ù and â€œUse extreme caution in how you take it.â€ù,Despite major reports on the need to improve health literacy issued in the last decade by organizations including the American Medical Association and the National Academyâ€™s Institute of Medicine, little improvement has been noted in how much patients understand and remember about encounters with health care practitioners.,A main obstacle has been the decreased time patients can spend with their doctors, dictated largely by managed care and other medical reimbursement plans.,A second hurdle is the embarrassment that patients with limited health literacy experience when they do not understand what the doctor has said. And, of course, asking for clarification is seriously impeded by the imbalance in power between the white-coated physician and the paper-wrapped patient. Even when conversations are conducted in the doctorâ€™s office with a fully clothed patient, patients are often reluctant to ask questions.,The tools for repairing this problem lie mainly within the realms of medical education and clinical practice. More medical schools, residency programs and continuing education programs for practicing physicians need to include training in clinical communication skills.,Dr. Sunil Kripalani of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and Dr. Barry D. Weiss of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson suggest these strategies:,Â¶Doctors should assess the patientâ€™s baseline understanding before providing extensive information: â€œBefore we go on, could you tell me what you already know about high ,?â€ù,Â¶Doctors should use plain language, not medical jargon, vague terms and words that may have different meanings to a lay person. They should say chest pain instead of ,, hamburger instead of red meat and, â€œYou donâ€™t have ,â€ù instead of â€œYour H.I.V. test was negative.â€ù,Â¶To encourage patients to ask questions, doctors should ask, â€œWhat questions do you have?â€ù rather than, â€œDo you have any questions?â€ù,Â¶Doctors should confirm the patientâ€™s understanding by saying, â€œI always ask my patients to repeat things back to make sure I have explained them clearly.â€ù Or, if a new skill like using an inhaler was taught, the doctor should have the patient demonstrate the action.,Â¶Then, as fail-safe measures, the doctor should provide written instructions and educational material for the patient and family to review at home.,Dr. Kripalani and Dr. Weiss say none of this should take more than a few minutes. And by tailoring information to a patientâ€™s individual needs and limiting it to the most important points, the process can save time in the long run, result in better control of chronic illness and lead to shorter and less frequent office visits.,Experts on health literacy also encourage doctors to assess patientsâ€™ health literacy by asking them to read aloud a list of 66 medical terms, each within 5 seconds. Patients are scored on how many words they pronounce correctly.,Do not wait until doctors become better at communicating. If you want the best medical care, you have to take the initiative. If the doctor says something you do not understand, ask that it be repeated in simpler language. If you are given a new set of instructions, repeat them back to the doctor to confirm your understanding.

"Walk into a New York theater at random and you have a decent chance of encountering a story about sex and its consequences, or a parody of some pop-culture phenomenon, or a tale of war and power. You have very little chance of encountering a play that looks beyond the earthly realm to the spiritual one. Life after death? Puh-lease; donâ€™t be so unfashionable.,The Magis Theater Company, though, is daring to be different with a thought-provoking adaptation of â€œThe Great Divorce,â€ù C. S. Lewisâ€™s story about a bus ride through heaven and hell. With a template that seems drawn from Danteâ€™s â€œDivine Comedy,â€ù  Swedenborgâ€™s â€œHeaven and Hellâ€ù and assorted other sources, Lewis planted himself as an observer of a series of vignettes in which souls struggling to find their proper place in the afterlife are led by more experienced spirits to confront their ruling loves. The viewpoint is Christian, of course, but the ideas carry across religious boundaries.,Trying to translate such a book to the stage could easily result in something resembling a rickety Christmas pageant, but the Magis version is long on theatrical skill and remarkably short on preachiness. Ten actors bring the scenes to life, among them George Drance, who did the adaptation and directed. The show begins with the audience on the stage, helping to form the crowd waiting for the aforementioned bus. A smattering of intriguing music by Elizabeth Swados enhances the journey, and there are even a few (happily, only a few) puppets.,Thomas Piper makes a fine Lewis, with everyone else in multiple roles. By the end of the 90-minute show,  youâ€™re feeling the limits of the form; even well-staged vignettes can be only so involving. Still, these various characters â€” the artist who is dismayed that what she thinks of as fame does not exist in heaven; the wife who realizes that what she felt for her husband was not love, but the love of domination â€” have plenty to say to those interested in matters of the spirit.",NEIL GENZLINGER,"JAN. 31, 2007","Lost Souls, and Puppets, in a Tour of the Afterlife",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/theater/reviews/31divo.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" and ,, his chief steroids investigator, have unleashed the threat of Congress on Major League Baseball. However, Henry Waxman, the chief bogeyman, apparently is not ready to speak publicly about what he might be prepared to do if Mitchellâ€™s investigation does not satisfy him.,With the Democrats snatching control of Congress from the Republicans, Waxman, of California, has become chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.,He was only the ranking Democrat on the committee when it staged the March 2005 hearing that produced the memorable Mark McGwire moment in which he uttered repeatedly, â€œIâ€™m not here to talk about the past,â€ù dooming himself and his baseball past to a pitiful purgatory.,Now, however, Waxman can thrust himself front and center on national television and have his own 15 hours of fame. Waxman has not commented on the Mitchell investigation, but Mitchell invoked the specter of Congress two or three times in a briefing for baseball owners two weeks ago.,â€œI donâ€™t have subpoena power,â€ù Mitchell told the owners. â€œUnlike the Congress or other federal and state authorities, I cannot compel cooperation. They can, and if they get involved, they will.â€ù,His comments were aimed at the clubs, but he was sending his message to the players as well. Selig has heard a message himself. He has heard that if baseball does not do a credible investigation, meaning if people do not cooperate with it, baseball will hear from the congressman from California.,Waxman did not respond to interview requests yesterday and last Friday. When Tom Davis, Republican from Virginia, was the chairman of the committee, he did not respond to requests for interviews, either.,I wanted to ask Davis and Waxman about steroids, but I also wanted to ask them why they are so concerned about the potential dangers of steroids when they ignore the 400,000 deaths each year that the United States surgeon general has said are related to smoking.,The number of deaths by steroids is minuscule compared with  deaths by smoking, but steroids apparently are sexier.,Congress, however, can take credit for pushing baseball and its union into adopting a tough testing program. It is also responsible for the Mitchell investigation. Had it not been for Congress, Selig would not have hired Mitchell to look into the history of steroids use in the sport.,Why baseball should have to dredge up its dirty past and the National Football League does not creates the double standard that must rightfully make Selig crazy. Baseball might have had a few home run hitters whose totals soared, but the N.F.L. has all of those behemoths stomping each other, and no one seems to notice or care.,The N.F.L. strengthened its testing program and received  a standing ovation. As part of the new program, the league added EPO to its list of banned substances. EPO is a synthetic hormone that improves stamina. Baseball did 500 tests for EPO in 2005, and no one noticed. When all of the tests came back negative, baseball decided that EPO was not an issue.,The N.F.L. will increase its use of carbon isotope tests, which examine the atomic makeup of testosterone in urine. Baseball already does that. The N.F.L. has pledged funds for the development of a test for human growth hormone. Baseball has already given money for that research.,Yet the N.F.L. is credited with having the most stringent testing policy among the major American sports leagues.,Congress has not asked why football players have grown enormously. It has not demanded a history of steroids use in the N.F.L., where and how it started and where did the stuff come from.,But Selig, in no uncertain terms, and Mitchell have told the clubs they better cooperate or the big, bad bogeyman Waxman will come looking for them.,Mitchellâ€™s remarks were aimed at the owners, but he knew the players would hear them, too. Investigators are said to have interviewed many former players but have not begun to approach active players.,There is nothing in it for players to cooperate with Mitchell. Even if they have never used steroids, they will be asked if they know of or suspect anyone of using or supplying them. They then could find themselves in the position of lying (they would not be under oath) or ratting, like Jose Canseco, on friends and teammates.,Baseball might have a good reason for trying to sort out steroids use, although no matter what is learned, it will be impossible to determine how to treat statistics, hitting and pitching, compiled in the steroids era.,The biggest headache will come from ,, who is 22 home runs from breaking Hank Aaronâ€™s career record of 755. Bonds has never tested positive for steroids use, but plenty of circumstantial evidence indicates that he benefited from the use of performing-enhancing substances.,Bonds also has not denied a report that he tested positive for amphetamines last year, the first year baseball tested for the pills known as greenies.,The San Francisco Giants earlier this month briefly explored ways of trying to get out of a tentative agreement they reached with Bonds on Dec. 7, including the use of the positive amphetamines test. But the commissionerâ€™s office told them that they could not do it, and yesterday they reached final agreement with Bonds, who then took the requisite physical.,The urine test that was part of the physical was not expected to turn up greenies or steroids.",,"JAN. 30, 2007","Baseball: Cooperate, or the Bogeyman Will Get You",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/sports/baseball/30chass.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"As sopranos age, it is natural to expect their voices to mature, to grow darker and thicker. Karita Mattila is now 46. And, as her riveting portrayal of the title role of Janacekâ€™s â€œJenufaâ€ù on Monday night at the , made vibrantly clear, Ms. Mattilaâ€™s artistry is maturing.,Yet she projects youthful sensuality and restlessness better than most sopranos half her age. And itâ€™s not just that Ms. Mattila is so lovely and agile. Though she has ample power and can send her cool Nordic voice soaring over the orchestra, she can also shape phrases with beguiling grace and girlish lightness.,Playing the winsome and foolishly trusting Jenufa, a young woman in a remote rural Moravian village in the late 19th century who favors plain country dresses and hates shoes, Ms. Mattila conveyed that youth is a time of rampant confusion and extreme emotions. Her portrayal was even richer and more complex than it was four years ago when the Met introduced this production by Olivier Tambosi.,For this revival of the opera, performed in the original Czech and in Janacekâ€™s 1908 version, the Met is presenting the legendary soprano Anja Silja as Jenufaâ€™s severe stepmother, the Kostelnicka Buryja. This character serves as the sacristan in the local chapel and sees herself as enforcer of the townâ€™s morals. Talk about ageless artistry; depending on which biographical sources you trust, Ms. Silja is in the vicinity of 70. If some of her top notes and softer high-lying singing sound somewhat strident and unstable, her performance was an object lesson in how determination and intensity are what matter. Despite the occasional roughness, her singing had a deep and true beauty.,Jenufa has fallen for her gregarious cousin Steva, the town rake and the owner, by birthright, of his familyâ€™s mill. Pregnant with Stevaâ€™s child, she is desperate to marry. But the boorish Steva has a half-brother, Laca, a mere worker in the mill, who is filled with fraternal resentment and jealousy over Jenufa. And the Kostelnicka, whose dead husband was a drunken blowhard, does not want her stepdaughter to make the same mistake.,The tenor Raymond Very brought a robust voice and hardy presence to his dynamic portrayal of Steva, while Ms. Mattilaâ€™s Finnish countryman, the tenor Jorma Silvasti, was an impulsive and pitiable Laca. In the horrific end to Act I, as he seethes with impotence, furious that Jenufa still intends to marry the cavalier Steva, Laca slashes Jenufaâ€™s rosy cheek, which scars her badly and causes Steva to reject her. What could be an implausibly melodramatic stroke is made searingly real through Janacekâ€™s music, which conveys first Lacaâ€™s longing, then arousal and then unhinged anger.,The production is loaded with symbolism: a huge boulder, signifying, it would seem, the oppressive, small-minded morality of the townspeople, is plopped in the middle of the Kostelnickaâ€™s house. Still, there are some striking images, as in the opening scene, when between high, bare rustic wooden walls we see a golden wheat field and a cloudless blue sky.,Janacekâ€™s unconventional score sets the vocal lines with a singsong naturalism, while in the orchestra cyclic motifs and melodic fragments swirl in a wash of thickly chromatic harmony, prodded along by obsessive rhythmic figurations. The Czech conductor Jiri Belohlavek was especially sensitive to the musicâ€™s lyrical outpourings and folkloric touches. With his approach, the rich, wistful and glowing music in the final scene seemed especially humane.,In a desperate fit to expunge the family dishonor and liberate her trapped stepdaughter, the Kostelnicka drowns Jenufaâ€™s infant boy in an icy river. The body is discovered,  and the guilty woman is led away by the stunned villagers. Jenufa and Laca agree to marry, taking comfort in their unromantic but reassuring devotion.",ANTHONY TOMMASINI,"JAN. 31, 2007",Big Trouble for a Small-Town IngÃ©nue,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/arts/music/31jenu.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Peter Bjorn and John kept flipping between two eras â€” the Merseybeat mid-1960s and the new wave early 1980s â€” during their sold-out set at the Mercury Lounge on Monday night. Both were times of crisp, upbeat, tuneful pop-rock: the first bright-eyed and fresh, the second more knowing and self-conscious. Peter Moren (on guitar), Bjorn Yttling (on bass) and John Eriksson (on drums) donâ€™t set out to revolutionize their chosen styles, only to give them a brisk, smart workout.,Peter Bjorn and John are from Stockholm, but they sing in English and sound largely British. Their stage clothes hinted at an alliance of mod (Mr. Moren in a suit), rocker (Mr. Yttling in a leather jacket) and punk (Mr. Eriksson in black with close-cropped hair). All three are songwriters, and they take turns on lead vocals, but leave most of them to Mr. Moren, whose voice has touches of John Lennon.,They understand pop songs as nuggets of emotion delivered in mechanisms of riff and hook, repetition and surprise. And they sing about falling in love and (more often) breaking up with concise verses â€” â€œYour tongue is sharp, but I miss the taste of itâ€ù â€” and reprises that donâ€™t wear out their welcomes. They also like to whistle many of their hooks, like the one in their European hit â€œYoung Folks,â€ù a wary loversâ€™ duet. On Monday  they brought along    Victoria Bergsman, until recently of the Concretes,  another Swedish band.,The trioâ€™s analytical side, its artisanal delight in the formulas of pop, comes through on its albums. Its new one, â€œWriterâ€™s Blockâ€ù (Almost Gold), captures the songs with schematic clarity. Onstage, Peter Bjorn and John were casual between songs â€” they introduced themselves as â€œPeanut, Butter, Jellyâ€ù â€” yet utterly precise during them, locking into every riff.,Live, the songs were no longer just neat exercises in pop structure. On Monday, Peter Bjorn and John hugely expanded the dynamics of their music. There was tension in an exposed bass riff, diffidence or resentment or triumph in the vocals, a fiercer attack as Mr. Moren laid on bursts of guitar. â€œThe Chills,â€ù which harks back to the postpunk minimalism of Joy Division, was extended and revved up with furious guitar tremolos and cymbal crashes, sounding far less resigned to the breakup it describes than it does on the album.

"Historians tell stories. That is their profession. And the goal of storytelling is to impose order on a disorderly array of facts, to steer events toward a conclusion that seems satisfyingly final, even inevitable. In â€œCry Havoc!â€ù Nelson D. Lankford disrupts the process. He unravels the events that led the North and the South to war in the weeks after Lincolnâ€™s inauguration in March 1861, disturbing the time-honored march of history with a series of provocative what-ifs. At every turn in a now familiar story, he suggests alternatives, missed opportunities and roads not taken.,Mr. Lankford, the author of â€œRichmond Burningâ€ù and the editor of the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, embeds his arguments in a slow-motion re-examination of the hectic two months after  Lincolnâ€™s swearing-in as president. He is interested in personalities as much as in ideas and in the pulse of public opinion, which he vividly represents through diaries, speeches and newspaper editorials. For Mr. Lankford the national drama was a clash not only of political theories but also of personalities and temperaments, starting with Lincoln, whose evasions and vacillations in this critical period only reinforced the morbidly suspicious mind-set of the Deep South.,Two big what-ifs dominate Mr. Lankfordâ€™s compact, engrossing narrative. The first, a hardy perennial for historians, concerns Lincolnâ€™s decision on March 29 to reprovision Fort Sumter, one of only two major military installations still under federal control in the seven Deep South states that had seceded from the Union.  The second concerns the efforts of Southern moderates to devise a third way out of the national political crisis, one that would keep the upper South in the Union without taking up arms against fellow Southerners.,The two what-ifs are connected, since the crisis at Fort Sumter directly affected the bargaining power of the moderates. If Lincoln had decided to retreat from Fort Sumter and hold onto the much more easily defended Fort Pickens, near Pensacola, Fla., as Secretary of State William Seward advised, a red-hot political crisis might have been defused and third-way moderates emboldened.,â€œThe Confederates would still have demanded evacuation of Fort Pickens,â€ù Mr. Lankford writes, â€œbut removing the Fort Sumter garrison just might have given the upper South unionists a strong enough hand to maintain control in their own states.â€ù,The internal debate between moderates and secessionists, played out at a special convention in Richmond, Va., that began in February 1861, provides Mr. Lankford with his best material. For long weeks moderates held the balance of power, resisting the impassioned oratory and threats of violence from rabid secessionists. Virginiaâ€™s struggle was repeated throughout the upper South, which held fast to the Union for longer than anyone had a right to expect, even after shots were fired at Fort Sumter on April 12, an event that produced â€œanguished indecisionâ€ù rather than immediate rupture.,One Tennessean advocated a border-state confederacy as a way to preserve â€œstrict neutrality between the madmen of the sections.â€ù  This option seems absurd in hindsight, but at the time, Mr. Lankford argues, it did not. A mere seven votes out of 141 at the Virginia convention pushed the state to secede rather than hold a statewide referendum on the issue. What if the vote had gone the other way? In the intervening weeks before a referendum, Mr. Lankford writes, â€œpassions might have cooled, and even if they did not, the unionists would have taken heart from defeating the radicals.â€ù,Some of Mr. Lankfordâ€™s what-ifs seem more like who-cares? Small decisions that if changed might have led to medium-size consequences read like niggling footnotes to a story that does not lack for dramatic sweep. But there are plenty of intriguing midrange possibilities to keep Mr. Lankfordâ€™s historical parlor game alive, especially in Maryland. If Gov. Thomas Hicks had given in to the demands of Democrats and recalled the general assembly in April, after Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the states to raise militias for war against the South, Maryland would probably have voted to secede from the Union.,Perhaps just as fateful were the unintended consequences of Hicksâ€™s decision to burn railroad bridges on the two lines that would carry northern militias south to Washington.  By making a wide circle around Baltimore, the troops avoided inflaming a city already on the brink of revolt and kept Maryland, however tenuously, in the Union.,Almost any outcome seemed possible in spring 1861. One of the virtues of Mr. Lankfordâ€™s approach is to put readers in the minds of ordinary Americans trying to make sense of volatile events. War did not seem inevitable: most Americans had lived with sectional conflict and inflammatory political talk for most of their lives. The North-South split was never clean. And consequences were never clear. In the euphoria after Virginiaâ€™s vote for secession, Confederate zealots foresaw a new economic order in which foreign trade gravitated to Southern ports, and cities like New York withered away.,â€œA gilded corpse lies on the shores of Manhattan,â€ù The Richmond Examiner exulted, as news spread of Virginiaâ€™s defection.,Mr. Lankford proposes a final what-if. What if the eight states of the upper South had all gone the same way? If they had all seceded, he argues, the North would probably not have been able to defeat the Confederacy. If they had all stayed, the war would have been over very quickly.,â€œThe tragedy for the country was that the upper South split roughly down the middle,â€ù he writes, the very outcome guaranteed to prolong the conflict as long as possible.,Of course, no one knew this, or anything else, for that matter. As one newspaper writer put it on April 19, 1861, â€œThree months ago a person would have been regarded as a madman who had predicted the present state of affairs.â€ù",WILLIAM GRIMES,"JAN. 31, 2007",The Many Roads Not Taken on the Way to Civil War,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/books/31grim.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"STONY BROOK, N.Y.,Fourth period on a midwinter Thursday, Christmas vacation a fading memory by now, and Lars Brownworth took his accustomed place in front of an American history class at the Stony Brook School here. He had been guiding these seniors through the Gilded Age lately, and for this session he planned to personify the era in the form of the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller.,For 45 minutes, Mr. Brownworth deftly orchestrated lecture, discussion and archival photographs to evoke Rockefeller in both his rapacious capitalism and social conscience. When the bell rang, out shuffled the audience, a dozen teenagers who might or might not remember any of this material beyond the next exam. In its satisfactions and its limits, such was the life Mr. Brownworth, the son of teachers, had gladly chosen.,That night, though, Mr. Brownworth, 31, set to work in his own apartment, writing an essay about Alexius I Comnenus, the Byzantine emperor from 1081 to 1118. After revision and rehearsal, the text would become the script for the latest installment of Mr. Brownworthâ€™s podcast. And if form held, something like 140,000 listeners from Afghanistan to White Plains would hear it.,In barely 18 months, Mr. Brownworthâ€™s podcast, â€œ12 Byzantine Rulersâ€ù (at ,/), has become one of the phenomena of the podcasting world. A survey of 1,200 years of rather abstruse history, starting with Diocletian in 284 and finishing with Constantine XI Palaeologus  in 1453, â€œ12 Byzantine Rulersâ€ù routinely ranks in the top five educational podcasts on iTunes, and in the top 50 of all podcasts.,In the digital era, this self-taught amateur has emerged as a figure somewhat akin to Will Durant in books or Jacob Bronowski on public television, an effective and engaging popularizer. Mr. Brownworthâ€™s podcast competes favorably with far more conventional and credentialed online fare â€” university courses in beginning French or Psychology 101, test-prep drills for the SAT. Even the other highly rated personal podcasts, like â€œWord Nerdsâ€ù and â€œGrammar Girl,â€ù appeal to dependably large audiences for etymology and grammar.,â€œItâ€™s a slightly frightening idea to think there are so many people,â€ù Mr. Brownworth said. â€œBut without question itâ€™s the most exciting part of my professional life. Weâ€™re in the middle of a revolution, and I feel incredibly blessed to be part of it.â€ù,While listeners address him in their e-mail messages with the respectful honorific â€œProfessor,â€ù Mr. Brownworth, in fact, holds only a bachelorâ€™s degree in history, from Houghton College in upstate New York. He started teaching at Stony Brook, an independent school, only in 1999, and his initial assignment was in the science department. To the extent that he had any specialty as an undergraduate, it was the Battle of Hastings, a long way from Constantinople.,What Mr. Brownworth always possessed was a sweeping intellectual curiosity about antiquity, which inspired him while he was growing up on Long Island to learn to read hieroglyphics and sound out the Greek inscriptions in the ruins of Herculaneum. He also had a talent for dramatizing himself, whether donning the set of armor owned by family friends or imitating characters from a firefighter to a gorilla in a series of home movies called â€œLarsâ€™s World.â€ù,Still, Mr. Brownworth had fallen into the passive assumption that between Romeâ€™s fall and the Renaissance there existed nothing but barbarism. It took a casual mention of a Byzantine empress in a book about Charlemagne that he read a few years ago for Mr. Brownworthâ€™s curiosity to be kindled. He followed it into such standard texts as â€œA History of the Byzantine Stateâ€ù by George Ostrogorsky and â€œThe Fall of Constantinopleâ€ù by Steven Runciman. On a school trip to Turkey, he walked into the very church where every Byzantine emperor had been crowned.,â€œThere was something mysterious about the Byzantine empire to me, this sense that it was lost history,â€ù Mr. Brownworth recalled. â€œAmerica is very much a Protestant country, and we really donâ€™t feel like weâ€™re connected to the Eastern world, that we donâ€™t share values. But itâ€™s not a coincidence that the Renaissance kicks off after the fall of Constantinople. A lot of those Greek-speaking intellectuals fled to the West, bringing their knowledge of the classics. That knowledge had been kept alive with the Byzantines.â€ù,BEYOND all the highbrow stuff, Mr. Brownworth also found plenty of blood and gore. He shared much of it with his older brother, Anders. Did he know that after the Bulgarians killed the Byzantine emperor Romanus they used his skull as a mug? (Cool!) Did he know that Emperor Basil gouged out the eyes of his Bulgarian enemies, leaving just a handful with sight to lead the defeated army back home. (Awesome, dude!),An executive at a technology company in North Carolina, Anders persuaded his brother in 2004 to write and record a brief lecture giving an overview of the Byzantine era. Then Anders posted it on his personal Web site. And nobody in the outside world paid the slightest attention.,But on the day in June 2005 when Apple began presenting podcasts on iTunes, while Lars was on an archaeological dig in Jordan, Anders put up the recording. A month later, 1,392 people downloaded it, and Anders told Lars, â€œI think you better do another show.â€ù By July 2006, 41,031 listeners subscribed. Last December, after being cited by both Apple and Wired magazine as one of the nationâ€™s most influential podcasts, â€œ12 Byzantine Rulersâ€ù drew 140,910 hits.,One listener is Christopher Roe, who was helping to build fire stations in the Afghan province of Khost last July when he alighted on â€œ12 Byzantine Rulers.â€ù After listening to a half-dozen segments, he decided to enroll for a masterâ€™s degree in history, concentrating on the Byzantine Empire. Now back in the United States, he is doing exactly that at Central Michigan University.,And there is Howard Moskowitz, a marketing executive in White Plains, always eager for something diverting to listen to on the treadmill or in the dentistâ€™s chair. â€œThis was the most marvelous series,â€ù he said of Mr. Brownworthâ€™s podcasts. â€œThe English is exquisite. Itâ€™s not florid, itâ€™s not self-indulgent. Itâ€™s a fascinating period of time no one pays attention to. And itâ€™s free. Letâ€™s not ignore homo economicus.â€ù,With 13 episodes completed, Mr. Brownworth said he expected to complete and post the last four by the summer. Some other topic, heâ€™s not yet sure what, will come next. For someone used to teaching students by the dozen, life as a  cyberspace star still feels strange.,â€œI canâ€™t believe itâ€™s that many people,â€ù he said of his global audience. â€œI always thought the only one listening was going to be me.â€ù",SAMUEL G.

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 â€” Some of the nationâ€™s most enduring memories of Senator , â€” memories she would happily erase â€” were etched on television more than a decade ago: She didnâ€™t stay home and bake cookies in her marriage. She wasnâ€™t â€œsome little woman, standing by my man, like Tammy Wynette.â€ù The headband. The hairstyles.,On Saturday, one week into her presidential campaign, the threat of a new, unflattering image surfaced: MSNBC used a microphone to capture Mrs. Clinton singing the national anthem in Des Moines. Her voice was, shall we say, off key. The recording was quickly downloaded to YouTube, the video-sharing Web site, and the Drudge Report â€” no friend of Mrs. Clinton â€” was steering readers to watch it. (By Tuesday afternoon, more than 800,000 had.),Clinton advisers found out about the YouTube video within minutes, and their campaign war room made a calculated decision: not to respond at all. They did not want to draw news media attention to the video; nor did they want to upstage their preferred news of the day, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s debut in Iowa.,â€œSenator Clintonâ€™s candidacy is not premised on her ability to carry a tune,â€ù said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser and war room manager. â€œWe did not see it as a significant threat.â€ù,Twenty-four hours later, no news outlets had made a fuss about the video, and the Clinton team privately declared victory.,The video clip may have been trivial, but the brief episode surrounding it illustrated how visual and audio technologies like video streaming have the potential to drive political news in unexpected directions, and how White House  candidates are aggressively monitoring and trying to master them.,Ambivalence among candidates about communications technology is nothing new; ,â€™s 2004 presidential campaign used the Internet as a fund-raising A.T.M., then stumbled after the widely circulated video of the so-called Dean Scream. But in the 2008 race, the blessings and curses are much closer to the heart of the candidatesâ€™ strategies and their determination to  control  how they are presented to voters.,Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign, for instance, has already shown that it is determined to use every new media tool to advance her carefully developed image as a centrist, and to re-introduce her to Americans as  warmer, more relaxed and confident.,A Republican candidate, former Gov. , of Massachusetts, most recently moved to regain control of his image as a social conservative after being confronted with video clips from 1994 that showed him defending , rights and gay rights. As that video moved through the YouTube universe, Mr. Romney responded quickly, saying he was wrong on some issues in 1994, a statement that was swiftly captured on YouTube as well.,â€œIn previous campaigns youâ€™d think or hope that the threat would just go away, but now itâ€™s imperative that you attack back quickly and personally, and with advanced technology,â€ù said Kevin Madden, an adviser to Mr. Romney.,As with Mrs. Clintonâ€™s failure to carry a tune, though, not everyone sees an invariable need for a quick rejoinder. A potential embarrassment popped up recently for former Senator , of North Carolina when old video surfaced on YouTube showing him fussing with his hair for two minutes. The clip recalled the Breck Girl sobriquet that the White House applied to him in the last presidential campaign.,â€œWe tossed around some funny ideas to deal with it â€” sort of asking, Is this really what matters to the country? â€” but we decided it was just not that hot an attack at this point,â€ù said Mathew Gross, the Internet strategist for the Edwards campaign. â€œThe question is, How much do campaigns allow themselves to be distracted by this stuff?â€ù,Several candidates began their campaigns this winter with kickoffs geared entirely toward new media. In late December, Mr. Edwards appeared from New Orleans in a campaign video from YouTube announcing his presidential candidacy, and also appeared that week on Webcasts from Iowa and New Hampshire. Soon afterward, , of Illinois and Mrs. Clinton announced their own bids for the White House in taped video messages on their Web sites.,Mr. Obama appeared poised and energetic in his video, choosing an open-collared shirt to convey a youthful spirit (though it was deemed too informal by some political analysts and fashionistas). Mrs. Clintonâ€™s video drew even more attention: she looked and sounded more relaxed than usual as she proposed that she and Americans spend 2007 having a â€œchatâ€ù about the future of the country.,There are jarring contrasts between the new Clinton video and the old news footage of the headbanded Mrs. Clinton: her physical appearance and her tone of voice, now softer, have changed almost entirely. Yet cable news has been recycling the old clips in recent reports about why Americans might view her as unappealing, or even unelectable.,â€œProbably more than anyone else in the field, Hillary Clinton is burdened with certain assumptions that people are making about her politics and her personality,â€ù said Paul Maslin,  Mr. Deanâ€™s pollster in the 2004 campaign. â€œThe upside is that she will have chances to knock down those assumptions and win people over. Part of the challenge is finding the best media formats to do that in.â€ù,Mrs. Clintonâ€™s advisers are moving to replace Hillary 1.0 with the newer model. Two nights after she announced her candidacy, she held live â€œWebchatsâ€ù on her site, answering questions (which were vetted by her staff) as she sat on a couch and tried to convey a homey touch. Some analysts described the â€œconversationâ€ù as an infomercial, and the Republican National Committee dismissed it as â€œHillaryâ€™s screenplay,â€ù but her team is promising more.,Mr. Edwards allowed bloggers to attend events on his announcement tour and to interview him, and gave them  greater  behind-the-scenes access than other campaigns have.,â€œYou have to be vigilant about the attacks in the new media, but you also have to be vigilant about the opportunities,â€ù said Mr. Gross, of the Edwards campaign. â€œIn 2003 and 2004, every other campaign yielded the online and new media advantages to the Dean campaign. That will not happen now.â€ù",PATRICK HEALY,"JAN. 31, 2007","To â€™08 Hopefuls, Media Technology Can Be Friend or Foe",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/us/politics/31video.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"On Election Day last fall in Maryland, fliers were handed out in black neighborhoods with the heading â€œDemocratic Sample Ballotâ€ù and photos of black Democratic leaders â€” and boxes checked off beside the names of the Republican candidates for senator and governor. They were a blatant attempt to fool black voters into thinking the Republican candidates were endorsed by black Democrats. In Orange County, Calif., 14,000 Latino voters got letters in Spanish saying it was a crime for immigrants to vote in a federal election. It didnâ€™t say that immigrants who are citizens have the right to vote.,Dirty tricks like these turn up every election season, in large part because they are so rarely punished. But two Democratic senators, Barack Obama of Illinois and Charles Schumer of New York, are introducing a bill today that would make deceiving or intimidating voters a federal crime with substantial penalties.,The bill aims at some of the most commonly used deceptive political tactics. It makes it a crime to knowingly tell voters the wrong day for an election. There have been numerous reports of organized efforts to use telephones, leaflets or posters to tell voters, especially in minority areas, not to vote on Election Day because voting has been postponed.,The bill would also criminalize making false claims to voters about who has endorsed a candidate, or wrongly telling people â€” like immigrants who are registered voters in Orange County â€” that they cannot vote.,Along with defining these crimes and providing penalties of up to five yearsâ€™ imprisonment, the bill would require the Justice Department to counteract deceptive election information that has been put out, and to report to Congress after each election on what deceptive practices occurred and what the Justice Department did about them.,The bill would also allow individuals to go to court to stop deceptive practices while they are happening. That is important, given how uninterested the current Justice Department has proved to be in cracking down on election-season dirty tricks.,The bill is careful to avoid infringing on First Amendment rights, and that is the right course. But in steering clear of regulating speech, it is not clear how effective the measure would be in addressing one of the worst dirty tricks of last fallâ€™s election: a particular kind of deceptive â€œrobocallâ€ù that was used against Democratic Congressional candidates. These calls, paid for by the Republicans, sounded as if they had come from the Democrat; when a recipient hung up, the call was repeated over and over. The intent was clearly to annoy the recipients so they would not vote for the Democrat.,While there are already laws that can be used against this sort of deceptive telephone harassment, a more specific bill aimed directly at these calls is needed. But the bill being introduced today is an important step toward making elections more honest and fair. There is no reason it should not be passed by Congress unanimously.",,"JAN. 31, 2007",Honesty in Elections,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/opinion/31wed1.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"One in eight adults in New York City has ,, and nearly twice as many appear to be developing it â€” a picture even grimmer than that of the nation as a whole, according to the cityâ€™s first attempt to definitively measure the rate of the disease.,The study, released yesterday by the  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, shows that almost one-third of those who have diabetes are unaware of it, as are many of those with prediabetes, or abnormally high blood sugar. That means they are not working to control the ailment and fend off devastating consequences like ,, kidney failure, blindness and amputation.,Even among those who know they have diabetes, the study found, more than half are not adequately controlling it.,â€œThis confirms that we as a society are doing a rotten job both preventing and controlling diabetes,â€ù said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city health commissioner. â€œWe can do a much better job helping people with diabetes get their condition under better control. The fact that there are over 100,000 New Yorkers with seriously out-of-control diabetes, and over 200,000 who donâ€™t even know they have diabetes, is a real indictment of our health care system.â€ù,As disturbing as the overall figures are, he said, they were not unexpected. They resemble estimates made by public health officials, who expected that the disease would be more common in New York City than nationally; diabetes is less prevalent among whites than among most other groups, and New York is a mostly nonwhite city.,But Dr. Frieden said he was startled by some of the specific findings, including the very high numbers among Asian-Americans, especially those from South Asia. The study indicates that more than half of the New Yorkers whose families are from the Indian subcontinent have either diabetes or prediabetes.,More than 90 percent of diabetes cases are Type 2 diabetes, which is closely linked to ,, lack of exercise, poor , and heredity. It is the nationâ€™s fastest-growing major disease, and people often have it for years before it is discovered.,The departmentâ€™s findings are based on a  study, the first of its kind, in which doctors examined and took blood samples from a representative sample of the cityâ€™s population in 2004 â€” more than 2,000 people from every neighborhood. The diabetes figures were the first to be released; more reports are to follow on ,, heart disease, obesity and other conditions.,The city modeled its study closely on national studies done by the ,, and officials say that New York Cityâ€™s is the first local or state government to match those. The city has conducted large health surveys by telephone, but the  examinations, health experts say, produce a more authoritative picture, and provide a base line for measuring changes.,Over all, 12.5 percent of adult New Yorkers â€” more than 700,000 people â€” have diabetes, the study shows. That is significantly higher than the 10.3 percent national rate. And in New York and nationally, about 30 percent of diabetics do not know it.,But Dr. Frieden said that within those numbers is a surprising detail: Among all New Yorkers with diabetes, whites are more likely than members of other racial groups to be unaware of their condition. â€œIt may be whites have less severe disease and therefore are less likely to be symptomatic,â€ù he said.,New York City also found that 23.5 percent of adults have abnormally high blood sugar, but not high enough to be considered diabetic â€” rather, a condition called prediabetes, which is often a precursor to the full-fledged disease. That is similar to the national rate.,Asians have the highest rates in the city, 16 percent diabetic and 32 percent prediabetic. The cityâ€™s report does not differentiate Asians by region, but officials said that the data in their study and others show that East Asians have below-average rates of diabetes, while South Asians have by far the highest of any large group.,Diabetes afflicts about 14 percent of the cityâ€™s non-Hispanic black population, 12 percent of Hispanics and 11 percent of whites.,The city has begun compiling a registry of people with diabetes, to track their control of the disease, identify the strategies that work best and determine how individual doctors and clinics are faring in treating it.",RICHARD PÃ‰REZ-PEÃ‘A,"JAN. 31, 2007","One in Eight Adults in the City Has Diabetes, a Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/nyregion/31diabetes.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"KENNETT SQUARE, Pa., Jan. 30 â€” Even after enduring eight months of searing emotions, the people most involved in attempting to save the Kentucky Derby winner , said the costly and complicated effort was a worthwhile pursuit.,In mourning, Barbaroâ€™s owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson; his surgeon, Dr. Dean Richardson; and others in the industry agreed that the experience had already paid practical and emotional dividends.,â€œI think the most important aspect of Barbaroâ€™s fight is that it focused everyone on what our capabilities are in treating serious injuries, of how many options we have now,â€ù Dr. Larry Bramlage, a noted equine surgeon in Kentucky, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. â€œI donâ€™t know how much was spent on Barbaroâ€™s care. But I do know that if you went out and got an estimate for launching a public-awareness campaign that educated the public as well as Barbaroâ€™s situation has, I bet you couldnâ€™t approach it for 10 times what it costs the Jacksons.â€ù,Neither the Jacksons nor the officials at the New Bolton Center at the University of Pennsylvania have released a cost figure for Barbaroâ€™s multiple operations and procedures or for his stay here in the intensive-care unit of the George D. Widener Hospital for Large Animals.,Bramlage, who is affiliated with the Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Ky., said that facility handles about a dozen operations a year similar to the one performed on Barbaroâ€™s right hind leg on May 21, the day after he shattered it in the Preakness Stakes.,If such an operation proceeds without complications, Bramlage said, it would cost about $12,000.,Barbaro had many complications, enough to require nearly two dozen procedures and cast changes. The cost of medicine and round-the-clock care quickly adds up: a dose of antibiotics for a 1,200-pound horse requires seven times the amount given to a human, Bramlage said. One day in intensive care can cost $400 to $1,000.,Several horsemen estimated that the Jacksons spent at least $500,000 trying to return Barbaro to the pain-free life of a healthy horse.,Richardson and his team here employed state-of-the-art techniques that Bramlage said he believed would soon become more popular. The system of locking plates and screws used to piece Barbaroâ€™s leg back together has only been used on horses for two years, Bramlage said. Likewise, he said, Richardsonâ€™s choice of managing Barbaroâ€™s pain with a catheter attached directly into the spinal canal was innovative.,â€œI think what the most amazing thing the Jacksons demonstrated was how people will do everything for their horses when it makes no economic sense,â€ù Bramlage said. â€œWe run into this all the time, and Iâ€™m not talking about Kentucky Derby winners. Iâ€™m talking about geldings and lesser horses, and owners who have to worry about putting their kids in school and paying the mortgage.â€ù,Most horses with injuries as severe as Barbaroâ€™s would have been euthanized on the racetrack. The Jacksons, however, have been involved in thoroughbred racing for nearly 30 years and have a reputation for going to great lengths for their injured horses.,Soon after Barbaro was injured, Roy Jackson acknowledged that his colt was insured for reproductive rights and life. As an undefeated Kentucky Derby winner, Barbaro probably was insured for at least $13 million, according to several owners and breeders.,Barbaro would have been valued by commercial breeders at about $30 million if his legs had recovered enough to support him as he covered a mare. Thoroughbred racingâ€™s Jockey Club does not allow artificial insemination.,John Ward, a third-generation horseman who trained the 2001 Derby winner, Monarchos, praised the Jacksons for sharing their experience with the world.,â€œWhat the Jacksons let everyone see is the agony that people in our industry usually go through in private,â€ù Ward said. â€œThey showed how much people care about their horses. They made a valiant effort and lost, but not before letting the rest of us see some miraculous medical work that we havenâ€™t seen before. We can get to the point that we can start saving these horses.â€ù,In the short term, however, the Jacksons must decide where Barbaro will be buried. The Kentucky Derby Museum wants Churchill Downs to be the site, and its officials have contacted the Jacksons. The couple said Monday they had not reached a decision on Barbaroâ€™s final resting place. They were not available to comment Tuesday.,Beyond the gains made in veterinary medicine, horsemen said they were touched by the overwhelming interest in Barbaro.,And just as the death of Dale Earnhardt in the 2001 Daytona 500 prompted Nascar to spend more on research to make its drivers safer, Barbaroâ€™s breakdown brought urgency to reducing the number of catastrophic injuries to racehorses. One important change sweeping the industry is the installation of synthetic racing surfaces, which are said to be more forgiving.,â€œIn this tragedy, I believe there was some reassurance for the industry that horses matter to a lot of people,â€ù said Jerry Bailey, the retired Hall of Fame jockey who is now an analyst for ESPN. â€œI wasnâ€™t aware of the depths of how much America cares.â€ù",JOE DRAPE,"JAN. 31, 2007",Barbaroâ€™s Plight Shined a Light on Advances,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/sports/othersports/31barbaro.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Besides the fact that  both are considered great movies, â€œThe Wizard of Ozâ€ù and â€œSilence of the Lambsâ€ù donâ€™t have much in common. One is the story of a girl from Kansas whoâ€™s transported to a magical land where animals dance and sing, and the other is about a serial killer who eats his victims. You wouldnâ€™t necessarily expect people to have similar reactions to the two movies.,But it turns out that, for whatever reason, they usually do. Those who love one tend to love the other, and those who think one is overrated generally think the other one is, too.,This odd little fact comes from an enormous database of movie ratings collected by Netflix, the online movie rental store. On its Web site, customers can give any movie  1 to  5 stars, and the company then uses these ratings  â€”  1.6 billion of them  â€”  to find connections like the one between â€œOzâ€ù and â€œSilence of the Lambs.â€ù,The system, called Cinematch, allows Netflixâ€™s Web site to bombard users with recommendations of movies they are likely to enjoy. Netflix executives  hope Cinematch will give them a leg up as  digital downloading allows dozens of other companies to sell movies over the Internet.,So on the Ides of March last year, Reed Hastings, the companyâ€™s chief executive, and three other executives were meeting  at their Silicon Valley headquarters to talk about making the system better. They had just finished discussing one failed effort â€” a promising algorithm designed by a hotshot computer scientist from Stanford (since lured to Google) â€” when Mr. Hastings threw out an idea.,â€œWe should run a prize,â€ù he said, an open competition challenging people to come up with a better version of Cinematch.,One of the other executives asked how much the company should offer, recalled James Bennett, the vice president who oversees Cinematch.,â€œA million dollars,â€ù Mr. Hastings said.,With that, Netflix unwittingly started down the path of proving that todayâ€™s economy doesnâ€™t have nearly enough prizes.,BACK in the 1700s, prizes were a fairly common way to reward innovation. Most famously, the British Parliament offered the Â£20,000 longitude prize to anyone who figured out how to pinpoint location on the open sea. Dava Sobelâ€™s best-selling 1995 book â€œLongitudeâ€ù told the story of the competition that ensued, and Mr. Hastings mentioned the longitude prize as a model at  that meeting back in March.,Eventually, though, prizes began to be replaced by grants that awarded money upfront. Some of this was for good reason. As science became more advanced, scientists often needed to buy expensive equipment and hire a staff  before having any chance of making a discovery.,But grants also became popular for a less worthy reason: they made life easier for the government bureaucrats who oversaw them and for the scientists who received them. Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason University who has studied the history of prizes, points out that they create a lot of uncertainty â€” about who will receive money and when a government will have to pay it. Grants, on the other hand, allow a patron (and the scientists advising that patron) to choose who gets the money.  â€œBureaucracies like a steady flow of money, not uncertainty,â€ù said Mr. Hanson, who worked as a physicist at NASA before becoming an economist. â€œBut prizes are often more effective if what you want is scientific progress.â€ù,In fact, when Netflix announced its prize in October, Mr. Hastings said he didnâ€™t necessarily expect contestants to make a lot of quick progress. Computer scientists say that Cinematch, along with Amazonâ€™s recommendation system, was already one of the most sophisticated. â€œWe thought we built the best darn thing ever,â€ù Mr. Hastings said.,But Mr. Hastings underestimated the power of an open competition. Within days, many of the top people in a field known as machine learning were downloading the 100 million movie ratings Netflix had made public. The experts  have since been locked in a Darwinian competition to build a better Cinematch, with the latest results posted on a leader board at Netflixâ€™s Web site.,Last week, I called ,, a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto whose team had been in first place  when I last checked. But by the time I reached him, his team had been bumped down to second by a Hungarian team.,(The contestants have also turned up some good trivia about movie preferences. , of Salt Lake City deserves credit for the â€œOzâ€ù-â€œLambsâ€ù connection.),To claim the million-dollar prize, a team has to build a system that is at least 10 percent better than Cinematch at predicting how many stars someone would give a movie. There are a small number of people, for instance, who love â€œThe Wizard of Ozâ€ù but canâ€™t stomach â€œSilence of the Lambs.â€ù Perhaps it is possible to identify them based on their attitude toward an eclectic group of other movies â€”  but only an advanced algorithm can find this pattern.,With four and a half years to go in the contest, the Hungariansâ€™ model is already 6.75 percent better than Cinematch. And Netflix hasnâ€™t had to pay for their time. In effect, the company â€œhas recruited a large fraction of the machine learning community for almost no money,â€ù as Mr. Hinton, the Toronto professor, put it.,These are the two essential advantages of prizes. They pay for nothing but performance, and they ensure that anyone with a good idea â€” not just the usual experts â€” can take a crack at a tough problem. Much to the horror of the leading astronomers of the day, a clockmaker ultimately claimed the longitude prize.,Grants are still crucial. (Someone has to be paying those computer scientists while theyâ€™re trying to win the Netflix prize.) But it seems pretty clear that our research system doesnâ€™t pay for results often enough.,Just look at how both political parties have so far tried to deal with ,. They have handed out grants and subsidies for various alternative energy sources like ethanol, even though nobody knows what the best sources will ultimately be. A much smarter approach would be to mandate that the economy use less carbon. This would effectively set up a multibillion-dollar prize  â€” in the form of new customers â€” for whichever companies came up with efficient energy sources.,The good news is that the Netflix prize is one of a handful of recent high-profile prizes. One of the others is the X Prize, which was created in 1996 as a $10 million purse for the first private manned flight to the cusp of space. It was  awarded just eight years later, showing once again that prize money has a way of focusing the mind.",DAVID LEONHARDT,"JAN. 31, 2007",You Want Innovation?

"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 30 â€” It has been 20 years since Cleve Jones started the , Memorial Quilt here, painting the name of a friend who had died from the disease on a simple piece of fabric.,During the next two decades the quilt became the largest piece of community folk art in the world, a 54-ton collage affixed with the names of 91,000 victims of AIDS, a tapestry of grief that was one of the earliest and most effective tools in raising awareness of the disease.,Now Mr. Jones is locked in a legal tug of war with the quiltâ€™s caretaker, the Names Project Foundation, over custody of 35 of its 6,000 panels. The dispute is not just about the relatively small swatch of the quilt, or even the simmering personality clash between Mr. Jones, a founder of the group, and his successors. More broadly, the battle reflects the changing symbolism and purpose of one of the most recognizable symbols of the AIDS crisis as the crisis itself has changed.,The confrontation has touched on issues percolating through the AIDS community, including the new racial, social and international demographics of the disease; changes in philanthropic trends; and the question of whether memorials are appropriate at a time when other major problems, including a rebound in unsafe sex and the emergence of  new drug-resistant strains, persist.,â€œThe quilt was very effective in the late â€™80s and early â€™90s for AIDS awareness,â€ù said Michael Petrelis, a writer in San Francisco who has been active in the AIDS movement. â€œOn the other hand, thereâ€™s hundreds and thousands of people that need a housing subsidy, just trying to keep a roof over their head. Should we be putting our time and money into another vigil? I donâ€™t know.â€ù,The legal dispute dates to 2004, when Mr. Jones filed a wrongful termination suit against the Names Project Foundation, which is based in Atlanta and was established to care for the quilt, after being fired from a job as a fund-raiser and public speaker. The  termination claims were dismissed, but a 2005 settlement granted Mr. Jones custody of the 35 billboard-size panels for his emotional distress. The panels are generally made up of eight individual quilts affixed with names of people who died.,The settlement called for Mr. Jones to establish a nonprofit organization to care for the quilt while it was in his possession. But in December, Mr. Jones informed the foundation that he would use an umbrella group instead of a newly formed nonprofit to sponsor the quilt, a plan the foundation said was unacceptable under the terms of the agreement.,A lawyer for the foundation, Charles Thompson, said the matter seemed closed. â€œMr. Jones didnâ€™t comply with the agreement, and our obligations are over,â€ù Mr. Thompson said.,That assessment has angered some San Francisco city officials as well as Mr. Jones, who said he had planned to return his piece of the quilt â€œto the front line of activismâ€ù in the city, a hot zone in the AIDS crisis where the disease, according to the cityâ€™s health department, is still a leading cause of death for men ages 15 to 54. Mr. Jones emphasized that he had no financial gain from the settlement, only a desire for more forceful advocacy.,â€œTheyâ€™ve taken it upon themselves to decommission one of the most powerful weapons we have,â€ù said Mr. Jones, who now spends his time in Palm Springs and San Francisco and works for Unite Here, a union representing hotel workers, among others. â€œItâ€™s not intended as a passive memorial.â€ù,The foundationâ€™s executive director, Julie Rhoad, said more than half of the 6,000 panels had been displayed in each of the last three years, including dozens of times in San Francisco. That said, the quilt,  which if unfurled would cover six city blocks,  needs constant upkeep, and the foundation has rules about lending it out and caring for it, Ms. Rhoad said.,â€œNot only do we need to look at our daily work of sending the quilt on the road and making sure we have it as active as possible,â€ù Ms. Rhoad said, â€œbut we also have to plan for long-term stewardship.â€ù,She said the focus in Atlanta has included more efforts in black and Latino communities, which were not â€œat the epicenter of the disease when we were founded.â€ù Like many AIDS groups, the foundation has been trying keep peopleâ€™s interest in combating the disease even as it has become a less imminent threat to financially stable gay white men, who long drove fund-raising and awareness efforts.,Kandy Ferree, the president and chief executive of the National AIDS Fund, which channels private and corporate money to AIDS groups, said fund-raising for some groups in the United States had lost a sense of urgency as the disease had begun  to devastate other, often poorer parts of the world.,â€œWe did not do a good job as domestic AIDS organizations in keeping the changing face of AIDS on the domestic radar screen,â€ù Ms. Ferree said.,Ms. Ferree added that while she supported the quilt, she believed  its place in the AIDS community had diminished in part because it was so large that it was rarely seen in its entirety. The whole quilt was last displayed in 1996 on the Mall in Washington, when it was visited by more than one million people, an event Ms. Rhoad called â€œtransformative.â€ù,But it was also expensive, leaving the group deeply in the red,  foundation officials say. That debt also coincided with the emergence of new drugs, which gave many long-suffering patients a new lease on life and caused a serious dip in philanthropic giving to AIDS groups.,By 1999, the foundation had laid off dozens of staff members  and substantially curtailed its operations. In 2001, the foundation relocated to Atlanta from San Francisco, in part for financial reasons as well as to bring the quilt closer to minority groups and civil rights leaders. Mr. Jones, who has AIDS, said he spoke publicly in favor of the move, though it was met with outcry from some San Franciscans who thought  the quilt should have stayed  in the city.,But Mr. Jones said he personally regretted the relocation. â€œSan Francisco is the birthplace of the quilt,â€ù he said. â€œItâ€™s part of our history. Are you going to move the cable cars to Spokane?â€ù,In 2003, Mr. Jones was dismissed by the foundation. He said he lost his job after he sought to display the entire quilt in Washington during the 2004 presidential election. Foundation officials said such a display would have seriously taxed the groupâ€™s financial and administrative resources but denied that the proposal had cost Mr. Jones his job. Court papers state that in 2003 Mr. Jones demanded that the board turn over the organization to him and oust its then-president, behavior the board found â€œunacceptably disruptive.â€ù,Foundation officials also said the legal proceedings with Mr. Jones had drained the groupâ€™s resources and thwarted plans to establish a permanent satellite display in San Francisco, something Mr. Jones calls â€œnonsense.â€ù The foundation had a $1 million budget in 2006, down slightly from the year before.,â€œThe quilt has always had a footprint in San Francisco,â€ù Ms. Rhoad said. â€œBut certainly you can understand that the institution has to have the financial underpinnings itself to have a satellite venue.â€ù But she added that a San Francisco quilt display was still on her foundationâ€™s â€œto-do list.â€ù,City leaders here hope so. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution saying it would be an â€œunconscionable and unthinkable offense against the citizenry of San Franciscoâ€ù if Mr. Jonesâ€™s panels were not returned. Some people active with AIDS groups have suggested the quilt be enshrined here in a new museum devoted to the AIDS crisis.,Still, there is a sense among some people that the quilt, like the once-ubiquitous red ribbon on the lapel, may have seen its cultural moment pass. Robert McMullin, the executive director of the Stop AIDS Project, a prevention group in San Francisco, said the quilt, like any symbol, might have â€œlost its punchâ€ù over time.,â€œThe quilt is about loss,â€ù Mr. McMullin said. â€œAnd while people are still dying, for most of us, the most important part of our message may not be about people dying.â€ù",JESSE McKINLEY,"JAN. 31, 2007",A Changing Battle on AIDS Is Reflected in a Quilt,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/us/31quilt.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"PERUGIA, Italy â€” Unlike many Americans who decide to follow their dream of restoring an abandoned Italian house in the countryside, Douglas Andrews knew exactly what he was getting into.,Not only did he have experience restoring other properties in Italy, he also had very specific requirements for his ideal home.,â€œI had been living in Rome for the past 15 years,â€ù Mr. Andrews said, â€œand wanted to find a place in the countryside that could accommodate my ever-expanding collection of contemporary art.â€ù,Mr. Andrews, 43, first moved to Rome as a student in Temple Universityâ€™s junior year abroad program. While he studied art history and did his share of the usual partying, he also began to dabble in real estate.,â€œUnlike some of my schoolmates,â€ù he explained, â€œI made a lot of Italian friends and it was through them that I discovered that Rome had quite a lot of undervalued and nondeveloped properties.â€ù He was able to buy centrally located apartments and fix them up for relatively small investments. â€œWhile I was able to turn them around pretty quickly, at a profit,â€ù he added, â€œI also had the great pleasure in living in most of them.â€ù,After 15 years in the city, Mr. Andrews decided to make a move to the countryside. â€œBy this time I had a rather large dog, Argo,â€ù he recalled, â€œand it just seemed like the right time to start looking for a weekend house.â€ù He and his partner chose Umbria, which is close enough to Rome for weekend commuting.,After eight months they found what they were looking for: an abandoned ,. Unlike run-of-the-mill farmhouses, which traditionally are on the small side and have living areas for both man and beast, , are more formal â€” mini-villas usually built by landowners.,His find, the Casa dei Frati (or House of the Friars),  was at the end of a farm road, and had privacy as well as sweeping views of the tranquil Tiber Valley.,Originally built by priests, the structure later had landowners as tenants. It was during that period that a wing was added and a grand entrance hall created. But the most recent residents were farmers, so that much of the ground floor had been subdivided and given over to stables. A tobacco-drying tower â€” 10 meters, or 32 feet, tall â€” was an addition from the â€™50s.,â€œWe had very strong ideas about how we wanted to restore the villa,â€ù Mr. Andrews said. His partner, who had studied architecture and already had a lot of experience fixing up places in Rome, drew a plan that restored the houseâ€™s symmetry and, even more important, its wall space, which was soon put to use as a backdrop for their art collection.,â€œThe symmetry and formality of the house was something we really wanted to emphasize,â€ù Mr. Andrews said. â€œWe did this by creating a semi-enclosed courtyard between the main house and the 16th-century outbuilding in the back.â€ù,Low brick walls embrace that side of the garden, which has a bubbling fountain as its centerpiece.,Because of building restrictions, the restoration project had to follow the footprint of the original structure. The main villa is on two levels, with 350 square meters, or 3,367 square feet, of living area.,A large eat-in kitchen and the formal living room both open onto a terrace with a panoramic view. On the upper level, there are four master suites, a den and an office, all of which look out over the valley.,Two small buildings were also restored. One, measuring 90 square meters, or 969 square feet, is used as an artistâ€™s studio, while the other, slightly smaller, is a garage and also has a small staff room.,Mr. Andrews declined to specify how much they have spent on the house, but Johannes Hermel, whose real estate agency, Casambiente, specializes in Umbrian properties, estimates that a similar villa would sell for about 2.1 million euros to 2.5 million euros, or $2.7 million to $3.2 million.,â€œItâ€™s hard to give a firm square-meter estimate of how much a house of this caliber would go for,â€ù Mr. Hermel said, but he added that, in certain parts of Umbria, the price per square meter can reach about 4,000 euros.,According to Mr. Andrews: â€œOur idea originally was that this would be a weekend retreat. Eventually, though, the weekends kept stretching from two days to three days, and finally we found ourselves spending most of our time in the country. I realized that it was time to give up the apartment in Rome, and move full time to the country.â€ù,â€œThis is our home base now,â€ù Mr. Andrews said as he walked through the fruit orchard, followed by Argo and his two other dogs. When asked how he likes winters in Umbria, which tend to be dark and dreary, he admitted: â€œSince my family is in the States, and I have a lot of friends in Berlin and London, I tend to travel a lot. And in the summer we both like spending time at the sea.â€ù,â€œAlso,â€ù he continued, â€œthe restoration bug is biting again, so while we are calling this home for now, we never get too attached to the places we restore. We may be moving on to our next project soon.â€ù,But Mr. Andrews recently sank his roots even deeper into the Umbrian countryside, establishing an olive oil business, Canonica Verde, with a friend and neighbor, Paula Hughes. The companyâ€™s Web site, ,, also offers Umbrian honey and spice blends.,â€œWe realized that, while the trees are beautiful to look at, the oil is unique, delicious and surprisingly hard to get in the States,â€ù he said.",ELIZABETH HELMAN MINCHILLI,"JAN. 31, 2007","Italian Countryside, Just as Imagined",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/realestate/greathomes/31GH-perugia.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
